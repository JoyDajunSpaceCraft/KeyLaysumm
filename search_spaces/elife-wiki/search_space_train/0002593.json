The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954. Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protective antigen (PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the endosome, the enzymatic components of the toxin translocate into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed for macrophage cells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade the immune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal. Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation of macromolecular assemblies, and on protein translocation, pore formation, endocytosis, and other biochemical processes.",

The alpha toxin produced by \"C. septicum\" is the underlying cause of gas gangrene, otherwise known as myonecrosis; a disease characterized by extensive tissue destruction, edema, thrombosis, and fluid-filled bullae. Alpha toxin is a pore-forming toxin exotoxin that is secreted as a protoxin that requires proteolytic cleavage of a 5kDa peptide from its carboxy-terminal in order to become active. Cleavage is typically initiated by the cell surface protease furin. Once activated, the toxin can oligomerize and form ion-permeable pores through the cell membrane. Pores formed by alpha toxin are approximately 1.5\u00a0nm in diameter, allowing the release of potassium ions from erythrocytes, thus disrupting the ionic equilibrium within the cell. Alpha toxin binds GPI-anchored cell surface receptors including the human folate receptor (hFR) as well as the neuronal molecules contactin and Thy-1 (CD90).  Quite surprisingly, the alpha toxin of \"C. septicum\" is not related to the alpha toxin of \"C. perfringens\" (another bacterium implicated in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene). \"C. septicum\" alpha toxin does, however, exhibit similarities to aerolysin, another beta-pore forming toxin. Alpha toxin and aerolysin share approximately 72% sequence similarity and have numerous functional similarities as well. Both proteins require cleavage by furin, or a furin-like protease, and then oligomerize to form transmembrane pores. Similarities between the two toxins have also been discovered through analysis of the crystal structure of aerolysin. Aerolysin is a bilobar protein consisting of four domains (D1-D4). The smallest lobe of aerolysin is missing in the alpha toxin of \"C. septicum\", implying that the alpha toxin is monolobar with three domains, similar to domains D2-D4 in aerolysin. Further research has led to the conclusions that the D1 domain is involved in receptor-binding and the D3 domain functions to prevent premature oligomerization of alpha toxin.",

In order for LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize to the cell and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer is often referred to as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the endosome causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a pH gradient, allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.",

A hydrophobicity plot lacking any patterns which are common to possible membrane-spanning domains. The structures of other multimeric membrane proteins (such as diphtheria toxin) provide the answer to how PA manages to span the membrane. It is thought that PA acts like these multimeric membrane proteins that form \u03b2-barrels made from stretchs of both polar and non-polar amino acids from each monomer. The formation of the \u03b2-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination of the structure of domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. The only problem is that the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a \u03b2-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a \u03b2-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a \u03b2-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 \u00c5 (1.2\u00a0nm), which fits the theoretical value of this model.",

RtxA is a virulence factor involved in cholera which facilitates colonization of \"V. cholerae\" the small intestine.

This protein is a member of the alpha pore forming toxins family, which gives it insecticidal qualities advantageous in agricultural pest control. Each Cry protein has some level of target specificity; Cry6Aa has specific toxic action against coleopteran insects and nematodes. The corresponding \"B. thuringiensis\" gene, \"cry6aa\", is located on bacterial plasmids. Along with several other Cry protein genes, \"cry6aa\" can be genetically recombined in Bt corn and Bt cotton so the plants produce specific toxins. Insects are developing resistance to the most commonly inserted proteins like Cry1Ac. Since Cry6Aa proteins function differently than other Cry proteins, they are combined with other proteins to decrease the development of pest resistance. Recent studies suggest this protein functions better in combination with other virulence factors such as other Cry proteins and metalloproteinases. Cry6Aa proteins are unrelated to other insecticidal crystal proteins in primary amino acid structure. The protein is rod-shaped, with a diameter of 25 \u00c5 and height of 95 \u00c5. It contains 475 residues, not including the N-terminal tail. Most Cry proteins have 3 main domains with functional homology across proteins, domain I contains an alpha helix bundle, domain II is composed of three antiparallel beta sheets in a Greek key motif, and domain III forms a beta sandwich responsible for catalyzing pore formation. However, Cry6Aa, a nine turn protein, consists of bipartite head and tail domains composed mainly of alpha helices. Secondary structure conformation is 71-72% alpha helices and 1-2% beta sheets in most pH conditions. The remaining regions are either bends, turns, or 3/10 helices. The trypsin resistant core is composed of long amphipathic alpha helices and fuels toxic function. The hydrophobic regions of the helices interact with each other, while the hydrophilic portions have increased exposure to the outside environment. Some of the helices are interrupted by loops that have variable positions in the structure. The head domain folds over the helices and contains a beta tongue group, which may trigger pore formation. There is a strong disulfide bond between the C terminal region and a portion of the core that isn't disrupted by trypsin. The protein has structural similarities to other toxins, including haemolysin E and B. cereus toxins HlbB and NheA.

Cleavage is typically initiated by the cell surface protease furin. Once activated, the toxin can oligomerize and form ion-permeable pores through the cell membrane. Pores formed by alpha toxin are approximately 1.5\u00a0nm in diameter, allowing the release of potassium ions from erythrocytes, thus disrupting the ionic equilibrium within the cell. Alpha toxin binds GPI-anchored cell surface receptors including the human folate receptor (hFR) as well as the neuronal molecules contactin and Thy-1 (CD90).  Quite surprisingly, the alpha toxin of \"C. septicum\" is not related to the alpha toxin of \"C. perfringens\" (another bacterium implicated in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene). \"C. septicum\" alpha toxin does, however, exhibit similarities to aerolysin, another beta-pore forming toxin. Alpha toxin and aerolysin share approximately 72% sequence similarity and have numerous functional similarities as well. Both proteins require cleavage by furin, or a furin-like protease, and then oligomerize to form transmembrane pores. Similarities between the two toxins have also been discovered through analysis of the crystal structure of aerolysin. Aerolysin is a bilobar protein consisting of four domains (D1-D4). The smallest lobe of aerolysin is missing in the alpha toxin of \"C. septicum\", implying that the alpha toxin is monolobar with three domains, similar to domains D2-D4 in aerolysin. Further research has led to the conclusions that the D1 domain is involved in receptor-binding and the D3 domain functions to prevent premature oligomerization of alpha toxin.",

In order for LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize to the cell and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer is often referred to as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the endosome causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a pH gradient, allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.",

It is thought that PA acts like these multimeric membrane proteins that form \u03b2-barrels made from stretchs of both polar and non-polar amino acids from each monomer. The formation of the \u03b2-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination of the structure of domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. The only problem is that the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a \u03b2-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a \u03b2-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a \u03b2-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b).

Cholesterol dependent cytolysins are a family of \u03b2-barrel pore-forming exotoxins that are secreted by gram-positive bacteria. CDCs are secreted as water-soluble monomers of 50-70 kDa, that when bound to the target cell, form a circular homo-oligomeric complex containing as many as 40 (or more) monomers. Through multiple conformational changes, the \u03b2-barrel transmembrane structure (~250 \u00c5 in diameter depending on the toxin) is formed and inserted into the target cell membrane. The presence of cholesterol in the target membrane is required for pore formation, though the presence of cholesterol is not required by all CDCs for binding. For example, Intermedilysin (ILY; TC# 1.C.12.1.5) secreted by \"Streptococcus intermedius\" will bind only to target membranes containing a specific protein receptor, independent of the presence of cholesterol, but cholesterol is required by intermedilysin (ILY; TC# 1.C.12.1.5) for pore formation.

These tubules are essential for uptake into the host cell. When the protein is inside the cell, the A subunit interacts with the ribosomes to inactivate them. The A subunit of Shiga toxin is an N-glycosidase that modifies the RNA component of the ribosome to inactivate it and so bring a halt to protein synthesis leading to the death of the cell. The vascular endothelium has to continually renew itself, so this killing of cells leads to a breakdown of the lining and to hemorrhage. The first response is commonly a bloody diarrhea.
