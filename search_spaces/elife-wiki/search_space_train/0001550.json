            "document": "Neck frill . In technical terms, the bone-supported frill is composed of an enlarged parietal bone flanked by elongated squamosals and sometimes ringed by epoccipitals, bony knobs that gave the margin a jagged appearance. In the early 1900s, the parietal bone was known among paleontologists as the dermosupraoccipital. The feature is now referred to as the parietosquamosal frill. In some genera, such as \"Triceratops\", \"Pentaceratops\", \"Centrosaurus\" and \"Torosaurus\", this extension is very large. Despite the neck frill predominantly being made of hard bone, some neck frills are made of skin, as is the case with the frill-necked lizard of today that resides in Australia. The use of the neck frill in dinosaurs is uncertain; it may have been used for thermoregulation or simply as a defense mechanism. Indeed, during battles for territory, competing \"Triceratops\" crashed heads together with their elongated horns and the neck frill may have been employed as a kind of shield, protecting the rest of the animal from harm. However, usage of the neck frill in modern reptiles is better documented. Two chief and disparate examples are the horned lizards (genus \"Phrynosoma\") with a bony frill, and the frill-necked lizard (genus \"Chlamydosaurus\") with a cartilaginous frill. The frill-necked lizard's frill is mainly made up of flaps of skin, which are usually coloured pink, supported by cartilaginous spines. Similar to the portrayal of the dinosaur \"Dilophosaurus\" in Steven Spielberg's \"Jurassic Park\", frill-necked lizard puff out these neck frills on either side of its head when threatened. The lizards often raise their frills when battling for territory or when coming into contact with another lizard, especially during mating season. There is, however, no evidence that suggests that \"Dilophosaurus\" neither had nor didn't have the same abilities, as many of its features in the \"Jurassic Park\" film were mostly fictional.",

The frills of \"Centrosaurus\" were too thin to be used for defense against predators, although the thicker, solid frills of \"Triceratops\" might have evolved to protect their necks.

            "document": "Triceratops . \"Triceratops\" were long thought to have used their horns and frills in combat with predators such as \"Tyrannosaurus\", the idea being discussed first by C. H. Sternberg in 1917 and 70 years later by Robert Bakker. There is evidence that \"Tyrannosaurus\" did have aggressive head-on encounters with \"Triceratops\", based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a \"Triceratops\" brow horn and squamosal; the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. Which animal was the aggressor is not known. Since the \"Triceratops\" wounds healed, it is most likely that the \"Triceratops\" survived the encounter and managed to overcome the \"Tyrannosaurus\". Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that if \"Tyrannosaurus\" attacked a bull \"Triceratops\", the \"Triceratops\" had the upper hand in defending itself, its sharp horns inflicting fatal wounds to the \"Tyrannosaurus\". \"Tyrannosaurus\" is also known to have fed on \"Triceratops\", as shown by a heavily tooth-scored \"Triceratops\" ilium and sacrum. In addition to combat with predators using horns, \"Triceratops\" are popularly shown engaging each other in combat with horns locked. While studies show that such activity would be feasible, if unlike that of present-day horned animals, there is disagreement about whether they did so. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on \"Triceratops\" skulls (and the skulls of other ceratopsids) are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study finds no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, there is no evidence of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes. A newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions and periosteal reaction in \"Triceratops\" and \"Centrosaurus\" and showed that these were consistent with \"Triceratops\" using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in \"Centrosaurus\" may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head. The frequency of injury was found to be 14% in \"Triceratops\". The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease. Histological examination reveals that the frill of \"Triceratops\" is composed of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that play a critical role in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. One skull was found with a hole in the jugal bone, apparently a puncture wound sustained while the animal was alive, as indicated by signs of healing. The hole has a diameter close to that of the distal end of a \"Triceratops\" horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.",

The maxilla, the upper jaw bone, of \"Wendiceratops\" had at least twenty-six tooth positions, in each of which several teeth were stacked to form a tooth battery. No orbital horns have been found. The nasal bone bore a vertical nasal horn. The exact size and profile of this horn are unknown but one broken specimen has a height of 115 millimetres and a base length of nine centimetres. Contact facets with the prefrontal bone suggest that the horn was located just in front of the eye sockets. The skull frill of \"Wendiceratops\" was broad. The front side of the frill was formed by the squamosal bone which had a rectangular shape. To its edge four skin ossifications or osteoderms were attached, the episquamosals. They had an asymmetrical triangular shape. Uniquely, they curled upwards. From the position of the fourth, frontmost, episquamosal a relatively high ridge was running to the inside, adorned with three substantial bumps. In cross-section, this ridge gave the squamosal the typical \"stepped\" centrosaurine profile. The rear of the frill consisted of the rounded parietal bones. They too had osteoderms attached to their edges, in this case called epiparietals. Each parietal had five of them, conventionally numbered \"p1\" to \"p5\". The fifth and fourth epiparietals, the ones in front, resembled the episquamosals. However, more to the back the epiparietals became increasingly wider, longer and thicker, curving upwards and to the front. This resulted in the first epipariatal becoming tongue-shaped and overhanging a large part of the frill, slightly pointing outwards. In this area the frill edge continued the curvature of these osteoderms, concavely curling upwards. Close to the edge two paired large openings were present, the parietal fenestrae. As no complete frill has been found, their exact form is uncertain but they probably were shaped like transversely oriented ovals. These openings were separated by a broad bone bar which featured a midline ridge that was rather smooth, not adorned by bumps. The bar ended at a gentle embayment of the frill rear edge. This lacked a central epiparietal or \"p0\".",

This was applied to the Centrosaurinae as a whole in 1997.

Growth marks within the bone indicate that the holotype specimen of \"Doswellia\" died at 13 years of age. Perhaps the most unique aspect of \"Doswellia's\" osteoderm development lies in the fact that the ridges formed from the bone instead of the pits. In most prehistoric armored animals with pitted ostoderms, the pitting pattern formed due to specific spots of the bone being reabsorbed, creating pits.

In technical terms, the bone-supported frill is composed of an enlarged parietal bone flanked by elongated squamosals and sometimes ringed by epoccipitals, bony knobs that gave the margin a jagged appearance. In the early 1900s, the parietal bone was known among paleontologists as the dermosupraoccipital. The feature is now referred to as the parietosquamosal frill. In some genera, such as \"Triceratops\", \"Pentaceratops\", \"Centrosaurus\" and \"Torosaurus\", this extension is very large. Despite the neck frill predominantly being made of hard bone, some neck frills are made of skin, as is the case with the frill-necked lizard of today that resides in Australia. The use of the neck frill in dinosaurs is uncertain; it may have been used for thermoregulation or simply as a defense mechanism. Indeed, during battles for territory, competing \"Triceratops\" crashed heads together with their elongated horns and the neck frill may have been employed as a kind of shield, protecting the rest of the animal from harm. However, usage of the neck frill in modern reptiles is better documented. Two chief and disparate examples are the horned lizards (genus \"Phrynosoma\") with a bony frill, and the frill-necked lizard (genus \"Chlamydosaurus\") with a cartilaginous frill. The frill-necked lizard's frill is mainly made up of flaps of skin, which are usually coloured pink, supported by cartilaginous spines. Similar to the portrayal of the dinosaur \"Dilophosaurus\" in Steven Spielberg's \"Jurassic Park\", frill-necked lizard puff out these neck frills on either side of its head when threatened. The lizards often raise their frills when battling for territory or when coming into contact with another lizard, especially during mating season.

They had an asymmetrical triangular shape. Uniquely, they curled upwards. From the position of the fourth, frontmost, episquamosal a relatively high ridge was running to the inside, adorned with three substantial bumps.

For the novel, Crichton invented the dinosaur's ability to spit venom (explaining how it was able to kill prey, in spite of its seemingly weak jaws). The art department added another feature, a cowl folded against its neck that expanded and vibrated as the animal prepared to attack, similar to that of the frill-necked lizard. To avoid confusion with the \"Velociraptor\" as featured in the movie, \"Dilophosaurus\" is presented as only tall, instead of its assumed true height of about .

Epoccipitals begin as separate bones that fuse during the animal's growth to either the squamosal or parietal bones that make up the base of the frill. These bones were ornamental instead of functional, and may have helped differentiate species. Epoccipitals probably were present in all known ceratopsids with the possible exception of \"Zuniceratops\". They appear to have been broadly different between short-frilled ceratopsids (centrosaurines) and long-frilled ceratopsids (chasmosaurines), being elliptical with constricted bases in the former group, and triangular with wide bases in the latter group. Within these broad definitions, different species would have somewhat different shapes and numbers. In centrosaurines especially, like \"Centrosaurus\", \"Pachyrhinosaurus\", and \"Styracosaurus\", these bones become long and spike- or hook-like. A well-known example is the coarse sawtooth fringe of broad triangular epoccipitals on the frill of \"Triceratops\". When regarding the ossification's morphogenetic traits, it can be described as dermal. The term epoccipital was coined by famous paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889.",

However, some say that the frill would have provided little protection from other large dinosaurs such as \"Tyrannosaurus\". Other possible functions include intraspecific communication for mating purposes or as a visual display of territorial protection, as seen in many common day organisms such as red-breasted robins. The frills also could have been used for species recognition purposes, as they seem to develop fairly early in life. There has also been evidence that ceratopsians care for their young, as bone-beds have been found of adult individuals with a nest of juveniles, although some refute this as viable evidence of care for young. There have also been bone-beds found with hundreds of adult ceratopsians, indicating herd activity. A few specimens have been found with puncture wounds, supporting the use of horns as protective or combative weapons. Other research examining juvenile ceratopsians reveals a change in horn morphology over time, suggesting frills and horns could have been used for intraspecific communication of age.

In both species these horns are quite short, but with \"C. russelli\" they are somewhat longer, especially the brow horns, and more curved backwards. The frill of \"Chasmosaurus\" is very elongated and broader at the rear than at the front. It is hardly elevated from the plane of the snout. With \"C. belli\" the rear of the frill is V-shaped and its sides are straight. With \"C. russelli\" the rear edge is shaped as a shallow U, and the sides are more convex. The sides were adorned by six to nine smaller skin ossifications (called episquamosals) or osteoderms, which attached to the squamosal bone.
