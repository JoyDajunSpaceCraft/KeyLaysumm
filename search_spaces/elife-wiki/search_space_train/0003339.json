Yeast CAPs are unique among the CAP family of proteins, because they are the only ones to directly interact with and activate adenylate cyclase. S. cerevisiae CAP has four major domains. In addition to the N-terminal adenylate cyclase-interacting domain, and the C-terminal actin-binding domain, it possesses two other domains: a proline-rich domain that interacts with Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of specific proteins, and a domain that is responsible for CAP oligomerisation to form multimeric complexes (although oligomerisation appears to involve the N- and C-terminal domains as well). The proline-rich domain interacts with profilin, a protein that catalyses nucleotide exchange on G-actin monomers and promotes addition to barbed ends of filamentous F-actin.

ERM proteins are regulated by an intramolecular association of the FERM and C-terminal tail domains that masks their binding sites for other molecules.

Secondly Ca indirectly activates proteins, called myofilaments, resulting in muscle contraction. The two main myofilaments in cardiac (and skeletal) muscle are actin and myosin. Ca binds to a protein called troponin, which is bound to the actin filament. This binding causes a shape change in the troponin which exposes areas on the actin, to which the head of the myosin filament binds. The binding of the myosin head to actin is known as a cross-bridge. A molecule, called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is produced by an intracellular structure called a mitochondrion, is then used, as a source of energy, to help move the myosin head, carrying the actin. As a result, the actin slides across the myosin filament shortening the muscle. This is called a power stroke. Myosin then detaches from the actin and resets itself back to its original position, binding to another part of the actin and producing another power stroke, shortening the muscle further. This process continues, with the myosin head moving in a motion similar to that of an oar rowing a boat, until the Ca level within the cell decreases (see figure 1).",

However, knockout mice appear to show ultra-structurally normal microvilli reminding us that the function of villin is not definitively known; it may play a role in cell plasticity through F-actin severing. The six-repeat villin core is responsible for Ca actin severing while the headpiece is responsible for actin crosslinking and bundling (Ca independent). Villin is postulated to be the controlling protein for Ca induced actin severing in the brush border. Ca inhibits proteolytic cleavage of the domains of the 6 N-terminal core which inhibits actin severing. In normal mice raising Ca levels induces the severing of actin by villin, whereas in villin knockout mice this activity does not occur in response to heightened Ca levels. In the presence of low concentrations of Ca the villin headpiece functions to bundle actin filaments whereas in the presence of high Ca concentrations the N-terminal caps and severs these filaments. The association of PIP with villin inhibits the actin capping and severing action and increases actin binding at the headpiece region, possibly through structural changes in the protein. PIP increases actin bundling not only by decreasing the severing action of villin but also through dissociating capping proteins, releasing actin monomers from sequestering proteins and stimulating actin nucleation and cross linking.",

Plasma gelsolin and cytoplasmic gelsolin are derived from a single gene by alternate initiation sites and differential splicing.",

            "document": "Orthoreovirus . Replication occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The following lists the replication cycle of the virus from attachment to egress of the new virus particle ready to infect next host cell.  Attachment occurs with the aid of the virus \u03c31 protein. This is a filamentous trimer protein that projects out of the outer capsid of the virus. There are two receptors for the virus on the host cell. There is the junctional adhesion molecule-A, which is a serotype-independent receptor as well as the sialic acid coreceptor. Viral proteins \u03bc1 and \u03c33 are responsible for attachment by binding to the receptors. After the attachment to the receptors, entry to the host cell occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis through the aid of clathrin coated pits.  Once inside the host cell, the virus must find a way to uncoat. The virus particles enter the cell in a structure known as an endosome (also called an endolysosome). Disassembly is a stepwise process. Uncoating requires a low pH, which is provided by the help of endocytic proteases. Acidification of the endosome removes the outer-capsid protein \u03c33. This removal allows membrane-penetration mediator \u03bc1 to be exposed and attachment protein \u03c31 goes through a conformational change. After uncoating is completed, the active virus is released in the cytoplasm where replication of the genome and virion takes place. Replication of the virus takes places in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Since the genome of this virus is dsRNA, early transcription of the genome must take place inside the capsid where it is safe and will not be degraded by the host cell. dsRNA inside of a cell is a tip off to the immune system that the cell is infected with a virus, since dsRNA does not occur in the normal replication of a cell. As transcription occurs with the aid of viral polymerase, protein \u03bb3 serves as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, full strands of positive sense single stranded RNA (mRNA) are synthesized from each of the dsRNA segments. Viral protein, \u03bc2, is known to be a transcriptase cofactor during transcription. It has been determined that this protein has some enzymatic functions such as NTPase activity, capping the mRNA transcript, even serving as RNA helicase to separate the dsRNA strands. The viral helicase comes from protein \u03bb3 These mRNA now are able to go into the cytoplasm to be translated into protein. The viral protein gyanyltransferase \u03bb2 is responsible for capping the viral mRNA. Mammalian orthoreovirus mRNA transcripts have a short 5\u2019 un translated region (UTR), do not have 3\u2019 poly A tails, and may even lack 5\u2019 caps during late post-infection. Thus is it not known how exactly how these uncapped versions of viral mRNA are able to use host cell ribosome to aid in translation. To be able to produce the genome, positive sense RNAs serve as the template strand to make negative sense RNA. The positive and negative strands will base-pair to create the dsRNA genome of the virus. The assembly of new virion occurs in sub-viral particles in the cytoplasm. Since this virus has two capsids, each capsid, T13 (outer capsid) and T2 (inner capsid) need to be able to self-assemble to form the virus particle. It is known that the assembly of T13 capsid is dependent on viral protein \u03c33. This allows the formation of heterohexameric complexes to be made. The T2 capsid proteins of orthoreovirus need the co-expression of both the T2 protein and the nodular \u03c32 protein to stabilize the structure and aid in assembly. Positive and negative strands of RNA produced during the transcription state must base pair correctly in order to serve as the genome in the newly formed virus particle. After virus has fully assembled and matured, the newly formed virus particle is released. It is unknown how they exit the host cell, but it thought that this is done once the host cell has died and disintegrated, allowing for easy exit of newly formed virus. Mammalian orthoreovirus does not really cause a significant disease in humans. Even though the virus is fairly common, the infection produced is either asymptomatic or causes a mild disease which is self-limiting in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory region for children and infants. Symptoms are similar to what a person might have when they have the common cold, such as a low-grade fever and pharyngitits. However, in other animals such as baboons and reptiles, other known orthoreoviruses fusogenic strains can cause more serious illness. In baboons it can cause neurological illness while in reptiles it can be the cause of pneumonia. In birds this virus may even cause death.",

In vertebrates, the villin proteins help to support the microfilaments of the microvilli of the brush border. However, knockout mice appear to show ultra-structurally normal microvilli reminding us that the function of villin is not definitively known; it may play a role in cell plasticity through F-actin severing. The six-repeat villin core is responsible for Ca actin severing while the headpiece is responsible for actin crosslinking and bundling (Ca independent). Villin is postulated to be the controlling protein for Ca induced actin severing in the brush border. Ca inhibits proteolytic cleavage of the domains of the 6 N-terminal core which inhibits actin severing. In normal mice raising Ca levels induces the severing of actin by villin, whereas in villin knockout mice this activity does not occur in response to heightened Ca levels. In the presence of low concentrations of Ca the villin headpiece functions to bundle actin filaments whereas in the presence of high Ca concentrations the N-terminal caps and severs these filaments. The association of PIP with villin inhibits the actin capping and severing action and increases actin binding at the headpiece region, possibly through structural changes in the protein. PIP increases actin bundling not only by decreasing the severing action of villin but also through dissociating capping proteins, releasing actin monomers from sequestering proteins and stimulating actin nucleation and cross linking.",

Many actin-related molecules create a free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization by creating a new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step in the formation of an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.",

Actin Depolymerizing Factor, or ADF, normally disassembles actin and does not allow for the induction of LTP. However, synaptic activity allows for the activation of LIMK1, a protein that phosphorylates the ADF/Cofilin complex at its phosphorylation site, Ser3, which inactivates the complex, allowing for the formation of F-actin. If this pathway is disrupted, then G-actin is unable to polymerize and LTP is inhibited. One particular actin binding protein that plays a major role in this pathway disruption is Gelsolin. This protein caps the barbed end of F-actin, thus blocking G-actin subunits to bind to the F-actin and allow for actin treadmilling. Activation of Gelsolin not only blocks LTP, but induces LTD. In LTD, the F to G-actin ratio is shifted towards G-actin and leads to a decrease in spine volume, as well as occasional disappearance of spines altogether.",

Classical cadherins are important proteins for cells to bind in the body (\u2018\u2019in vivo\u2019\u2019) where they commonly stabilize cell\u2013cell junctions known as adherens junctions. Cadherins stabilize adherens junctions through the interaction of the cadherin cytoplasmic domains with catenin proteins, such as p120-catenin, beta-catenin and alpha-catenin. Catenins, in turn, bind to the actin cytoskeleton. Binding of these proteins to the actin cytoskeleton prevents actin from growing (a process known as polymerization) and therefore keeps cells stationary. Cadherins regulate cell\u2013cell adhesion during development of the body and in adult tissue. Disruption of cadherin proteins, by genetic alteration or by changes to the structure or function of the protein, has been linked to tumor progression. Notably, PTPmu regulates the adhesion of cells to the classical cadherins. PTPmu likely regulates cadherin-dependent adhesion by interacting with both cadherins and catenins via PTPmu\u2019s cytoplasmic domain. To support this assertion, PTPmu has been shown to interact with and/or dephosphorylate many signaling proteins involved in regulating the cadherin-catenin complex, including p120 catenin, and E-cadherin (CDH1 (gene)) and N-cadherin (CDH2). PTPmu has also been shown to interact with the c-Met hepatocyte growth factor receptor, a protein that is also localized to adherens junctions. Although p120 catenin is a potential substrate of PTPmu, others have suggested that the interaction between PTPmu and catenins is only indirect through E-cadherin. \u03b13\u03b21 integrin and the tetraspanin CD151 regulate PTPmu gene expression to promote E-cadherin-mediated cell\u2013cell adhesion.",
