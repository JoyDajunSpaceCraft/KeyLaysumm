For many species of plant, such as species of \"Viscaria\", only bees and butterflies have proboscides long enough to pollinate effectively. For example, studies show \"B. lapidarius\" was more numerous and had a higher feeding density than other species studied. Further, \"Bombus lapidarius\" is important in pollinating many other species, including \"Centaurea scabiosa\". A study found that though \"Apis mellifera\" was also involved in pollination of this species, \"B. lapidarius\" greatly outnumbers \"Apis\" and other bee species in number and importance in pollination. Though initially attracted to flowers by the color, the scent is what drives attention as the bees approach flowers. it has been suggested that some individuals are better able to interpret differences in scent in the flowers than others. It has been suggested that these differences in ability developed evolutionarily as different types of bees developed specific roles within the colony. How long a bee stays at a particular flower seems to be connected to behavior, as it appeared the bees assumed low pollen reward, despite increased pollen levels in experiments. However, the amount of pollen transferred in a visit from \"B. lapidarius\" was only affected by the amount of pollen in the flower that individual was at. Further, it appeared that variation in duration of visits to different flowers was related to differences in foraging speed, not differences in how well the bee was able to remove nectar.  Bees will typically forage in patches, but show no clear directionality in their foraging. Further, pollinating bees will usually visit the nearest neighboring plants, thus gene flow between plants tends to be pretty limited.  Other experiments also indicated that body size is an important factor in how bumblebees pollinate. It would appear that size affects how often the bee will visit flowers as well as how well the bee could pollinate. Smaller bees seem to pollinate more effectively than larger bees. Yet, there did not appear to be a correlation between floral display size and body size. Therefore, it was suggested that bumblebees of all different sizes respond in the same way to floral display size.",

The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects. This meets the birds' high energy requirements, the most important determinants of flower choice. In \"Mimulus\", an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination. Therefore, red pigments in the flowers of \"Mimulus cardinalis\" may function primarily to discourage bee visitation. In \"Penstemon\", flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird' adaptations, but adaptation 'towards' birds and 'away' from bees can happen simultaneously. However, some flowers such as \"Heliconia angusta\" appear not to be as specifically ornithophilous as had been supposed: the species is occasionally (151 visits in 120 hours of observation) visited by \"Trigona\" stingless bees.

Honey bees are adept at associative learning, and many of the phenomena of operant and classical conditioning take the same form in honey bees as they do in the vertebrates. Efficient foraging requires such learning. For example, honey bees make few repeat visits to a plant if it provides little in the way of reward. A single forager will visit different flowers in the morning and, if there is sufficient reward in a particular kind of flower, she will make visits to that type of flower for most of the day, unless the plants stop producing nectar or weather conditions change.  A relatively recent experiment demonstrates several aspects of bee learning. Foragers were trained to enter a simple Y-shaped maze that had been marked at the entrance with a particular color. Inside the maze was a branching point where the bee was required to choose between two paths. One path, which led to the food reward, was marked with the same color that had been used at the entrance to the maze, while the other was marked with a different color. Foragers learned to choose the correct path, and continued to do so when a different kind of marker (black and white stripes oriented in various directions) was substituted for the colored markers. When the experimental conditions were reversed, rewarding bees for choosing the inner passage marked with a symbol that was different from the entrance symbol, the bees again learned to choose the correct path. Variations in the length of the tunnel between the stimulus markers showed that bees retain information in working memory for about 5 seconds, equivalent to the short-term memory of birds. Altogether, the experiments demonstrated that bees can to choose between alternatives, determine if a stimulus is the same or different than one seen earlier, remember the earlier one for a short period, and generalize this performance to new pairs of stimuli.",

Even though these experiments demonstrate that bumblebees forage in a frequency-dependent manner, the strength of this response can be asymmetric for different colors. For example, experiments using blue and yellow discs to represent corolla colors demonstrated that, although bumblebees preferentially foraged on the most common morph when rewards were present, the threshold for switching to the common morph was different for both colors. Bumblebees exhibit an innate preference for blue corollas, as this color is very conspicuous to bees against green-colored backgrounds. It was observed that in order for bees to switch from blue flowers to yellow, the yellow-to-blue ratio had to be much higher than the ratio of blue-to-yellow flowers that were required for the opposite switch. In other words, bees would forage on blue flowers until morphs of this colour reached relatively lower frequencies compared to yellow flowers. However, this preference for blue was not as pronounced when both morphs contained high levels of nectar. Therefore, frequency-dependent preferences must be considered along-with frequency-independent preferences to truly understand the visitation behavior of pollinators.

Since bees have a source of plentiful pollen that they do not have to compete with other insects for, they are more likely to visit these flowers. This then allows the flowers to more successful reproductively because the plants maximize their pollen dispersal with each bee visit, and less pollen is lost. The relationship between buzz pollinated plants and bees benefits both groups and could be why poricidal anthers have been successful evolutionarily. Pollinator and flower relationships have been observed in \"Orphium frutescens\", a small shrub that has poricidal anthers. Bees visited these plants outside of the University of Cape Town and continued to visit the plants even when all of the pollen had been extracted. Although the bees did not know the O. frutescens\" would benefit from these multiple visits as the plants continue to produce pollen during the flowering season.",

The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects. This meets the birds' high energy requirements, the most important determinants of flower choice. In \"Mimulus\", an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination. Therefore, red pigments in the flowers of \"Mimulus cardinalis\" may function primarily to discourage bee visitation. In \"Penstemon\", flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird' adaptations, but adaptation 'towards' birds and 'away' from bees can happen simultaneously.

As the flowers of the Asiatic dayflower lack nectar, they offer only pollen as a reward to their visitors. To attract pollinators, the plant has three types of brightly colored floral organs: the large blue petals, fertile yellow anthers, and infertile yellow antherodes that lack pollen. When the infertile antherodes were experimentally removed in natural populations, the number of total floral visitor landings was reduced, supporting the hypothesis that these infertile anthers essentially trick their pollinators into believing they offer more than they actually do. When the central, bright yellow fertile anther was removed, leaving only two brown fertile anthers, the frequency of legitimate flower landings decreased, meaning that the visitors were not pollinating the flowers, suggesting that floral signals also prevent \"theft\", or visits where the pollinators take pollen, but do not place any on the stigma. Thus both the fertile anthers and the infertile antherodes were shown to play an important role in both increasing visitor landings and orienting floral visitors toward a landing point appropriate for pollination.",

Nectar robbers may change the behaviour of legitimate pollinators in other ways, such as by reducing the amount of nectar available. This may force pollinators to visit more flowers in their nectar foraging. The increased number of flowers visited and longer flight distances increase pollen flow and outcrossing, which is beneficial for the plant because it lessens inbreeding depression.

Pollen grains of entomophilous plants are generally larger than the fine pollens of anemophilous (wind-pollinated) plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, entomophilous plants have to bear the energetic costs of producing nectar. Butterflies and moths have hairy bodies and long proboscides which can probe deep into tubular flowers. Butterflies mostly fly by day and are particularly attracted to pink, mauve and purple flowers. The flowers are often large and scented, and the stamens are so-positioned that pollen is deposited on the insects while they feed on the nectar. Moths are mostly nocturnal and are attracted by night-blooming plants. The flowers of these are often tubular, pale in colour and fragrant only at night. Hawkmoths tend to visit larger flowers and hover as they feed; they transfer pollen by means of the proboscis. Other moths land on the usually smaller flowers, which may be aggregated into flowerheads. Their energetic needs are not so great as those of hawkmoths and they are offered smaller quantities of nectar.",

Floral biology is a bigger field that includes these studies. Most flowering plants, or angiosperms, are pollinated by animals, and especially by insects. The major flower-frequenting insect taxa include beetles, flies, wasps, bees, ants, thrips, butterflies, and moths. Insects carry out pollination when visiting flowers to obtain nectar or pollen, to prey on other species, or when pseudo-copulating with insect-mimicking flowers such as orchids. Pollination-related interactions between plants and insects are considered mutualistic, and the relationships between plants and their pollinators have likely led to increased diversity of both angiosperms and the animals that pollinate them.",

Bumblebees are also able to fly in cooler temperatures and lower flight levels than many other bees. Additionally, bumblebees perform \"buzz pollination\". This behavior is displayed when a bumblebee grabs the pollen-producing structure of the flower in her jaws and vibrates her wing musculature, causing vibrations that dislodge pollen that would have otherwise remained trapped in the flower's anthers. Tomatoes, peppers, and cranberries are some of the plants that require this type of pollination. For these reasons, bumblebees are considered to be more effective pollinators than honey bees. \"Bombus occidentalis\" has been commercially reared to pollinate crops such as alfalfa, avocados, apples, cherries, blackberries, cranberries, and blueberries.",

Instead they focused on energy allocation to pollen production. Species of angiosperms that have nectaries use the nectar to attract pollinators that consume the nectar, such as birds and butterflies. In Bromeliaceae, septal nectaries are common in species that are insect or bird pollinated. In species that are wind pollinated, nectaries are often absent because there is no pollinator to provide a reward for. In flowers that are generally pollinated by long-tongued organism such as certain flies, moths, butterflies, and birds, nectaries in the ovaries are common because they are able to reach the nectar reward when pollinating.

The leaves are alternately arranged and overlapping, with a number of small leaves in the axil of one larger leaf. They are linear to spatula-shaped and about a centimeter long. The top of each stem is occupied by a short inflorescence of flowers. There are three types of flowers on this plant. The most obvious is the chasmogamous type borne in the inflorescence on the stem. These are each half a centimeter long with pink winglike sepals and three smaller tufted pink petals at the center. The second type of flower is cleistogamous and borne at the base of the plant. These do not open, but self-pollinate. These flowers, which occur at the leaf axils, are rare. The third type of flower is a cleistogamous, unopening type that remains underground. These are borne on a stalk up to 40 centimeters long which is located just below the surface of the soil. They are white in color, and also self-pollinate. The very uncommon mode of reproduction characterized by aboveground chasmogamous flowers and belowground cleistogamous flowers is called amphicarpy and it is known from fewer than 100 plant species. The different types of flowers may occur at different times of the year. The aboveground flowers depend on insect pollinators for successful reproduction, as evidenced by the low fruit production of flowers in a pollinator-exclusion experiment. Pollinators include bee-flies, flower flies, and leaf-cutter bees. The fruit is a capsule containing cylindrical seeds each about 0.3 centimeters long. The seeds have hairs which attract ants, which then collect and disperse them. The most common type of seed-collecting ant is \"Pheidole morrissii\" and others include \"Paratrichina arenavaga\" and \"P. phantasma\".",

Some studies have demonstrated that bumblebees prefer the relatively common corolla color, but in other studies there did not appear to be any observable pattern of bee visitation behavior. This discrepancy between laboratory and field studies may be due to the fact that laboratory studies use highly contrasting corolla colors and it is likely that color polymorphisms in the wild are not this distinct, making frequency-dependence weaker in natural settings. Additionally, in natural populations multiple traits that are attractive to pollinators may be genetically correlated with one another (pleiotropy), so looking at pollinator response to a single trait in isolation may not be appropriate under these circumstances. Also, frequency-dependent foraging is not apparent until many flowers have been visited (more than 100). Therefore, considering morph frequency within localized patches of flowers in natural settings may not be sufficient. Instead, morph frequency may need to be calculated over large spatial ranges to determine the extent to which pollinators are foraging in a frequency-dependent manner.",

Although a recent review concluded that there is \"overwhelming evidence that functional groups exert different selection pressures on floral traits\", the sheer complexity and subtlety of plant-pollinator interactions (and the growing recognition that non-pollinating organisms such as seed predators can affect the evolution of flower traits) means that this debate is likely to continue for some time.",

Many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas (parts of the flower). One such example of a flower is the p\u014dhutukawa (\"Metrosideros excelsa\") which acts to regulate colour within a different way. The p\u014dhutukawa contains small petals also having bright large red clusters of stamens. Another attractive mechanism for flowers is the use of scent which is highly attractive towards humans such as the rose, but some are very fragrant within attracting flies as they have a smell of rotting meat. Dark is another factor in which flowers have grown to adapt these conditions so colour lacks vision at night therefore scent is the solution for flowers which are pollinated by night flying insects such as the moth.",

They also are important pollinators of flowers with various forms of lids, such as \"Salvia\" species and some members of the Fabaceae. However many carpenter bees \"rob\" nectar by slitting the sides of flowers with deep corollae. \"Xylocopa virginica\" is one example of a species with such nectar robbing behavior. With their short labia the bees cannot reach the nectar without piercing the long-tubed flowers; they miss contact with the anthers and perform no pollination. In some plants, this reduces fruit and seed production, while others have developed defence mechanisms against nectar robbing. When foraging for pollen from some species with tubular flowers however, the same species of carpenter bees still achieve pollination, if the anthers and stigmata are exposed together. Many Old World carpenter bees have a special pouch-like structure on the inside of their first metasomal tergite called the acarinarium where certain mites (\"Dinogamasus\" species) reside as commensals.

Female flowers have the petals only partially separated, and the petals separate widely when they become male flowers.
