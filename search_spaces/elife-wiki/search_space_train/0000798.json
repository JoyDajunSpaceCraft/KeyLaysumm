There are many hypotheses to explain why organelles retain a small portion of their genome; however no one hypothesis will apply to all organisms and the topic is still quite controversial. The hydrophobicity hypothesis states that highly hydrophobic (water hating) proteins (such as the membrane bound proteins involved in redox reactions) are not easily transported through the cytosol and therefore these proteins must be encoded in their respective organelles. The code disparity hypothesis states that the limit on transfer is due to differing genetic codes and RNA editing between the organelle and the nucleus. The redox control hypothesis states that genes encoding redox reaction proteins are retained in order to effectively couple the need for repair and the synthesis of these proteins. For example, if one of the photosystems is lost from the plastid, the intermediate electron carriers may lose or gain too many electrons, signalling the need for repair of a photosystem. The time delay involved in signalling the nucleus and transporting a cytosolic protein to the organelle results in the production of damaging reactive oxygen species.

This CRM1/exportin1/NES-cargo interaction is stabilized by Ran-GTP binding which forms a complex that can transport the cargo to the cytoplasm. There, the cargo will be released when the Ran-GTP protein is hydrolyzed by a cytoplasmic Ran-GTPase enzyme to form Ran-GDP. This step completes the transport process and CRM1/exportin1 reenters the nucleus for more cargo binding. Leptomycin B and callystatin A inhibit the action of CRM1/exportin1 by a likely Michael-type addition of the thiol group from a cysteine residue of CRM1/exportin1 to form a covalent bond.

Rab GTPases, such as Rab11, are enzymes that are involved in vesicular trafficking. Rab11 specifically plays a key role in endocytic trafficking and recycling through guiding early endosomes to endosome recycling complexes. Rab11FIP5, like most other Rab11FIP proteins, interacts with Rab11 by serving as an adaptor protein. This leads to downstream changes with regards to which proteins can interact. This is a result of the various Rab11FIP proteins that each have different binding partners. This process allows for the coordination and organization of endosomal transport and ultimately gives Rab11 its versatile function in the cell. It is believed that Rab11 recruits specific Rab11FIP proteins to the surface of vesicles in order to determine how the vesicle will behave. Studies have shown that Rab11FIP5 localizes to the perinuclear endosomes where it aids in sorting vesicles into the slow recycling route. This process involves the transport of cargo proteins, like endocytosed receptors, to endosome recycling complexes and subsequently to the plasma membrane. This is in contrast to the fast constitutive recycling route which allows for the direct transport of cargo from the endosome to the plasma membrane. Rab11FIP5 aids in this sorting process by binding to kinesin II and forming a protein complex to regulate vesicular trafficking. Some of the proteins that are regulated through Rab11FIP5 mediated vesicle trafficking are microtubule proteins and the TfR receptor. This links Rab11FIP5 functionality to the cell cytoskeleton and the iron uptake of a cell, respectively. Rab11FIP5 has been shown to play a role in the nervous system because it functions in neurons. Studies have suggested that Rab11FIP5 is involved in regulating the localization of the postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptor. The AMPA receptor is an excitatory receptor that can be found on the plasma membranes of neurons. Studies have shown that mice with the Rab11FIP5 gene knocked out have severe long term neuronal depression. Without the presence of Rab11FIP5, it is hypothesized that the internalized AMPA receptors cannot be recycled back onto the plasma membrane because the receptors cannot be correctly trafficked to intracellular organelles responsible for recycling. Rab11FIP5 has also been implicated as a protein involved in the creation of tissue polarity during development. Rab11FIP5 has been shown to be involved in the vesicle trafficking and degradation of proteins used to coordinate embryonic development. This is conducted in a manner that helps maintain the ectoderm polarity in embryonic Drosophila. Rab11FIP5 is also suggested to be involved in aiding salivary epithelial cells to adjust to extracellular pH. V-ATPase, a proton pump protein, has been shown to be reliant on Rab11FIP5 mediated vesicle trafficking. When Rab11FIP5 is knocked down, salivary cells cannot correctly translocate V-ATPase to the plasma membrane in response to extracellular acidosis. While this pathway remains largely unknown, these results suggest a link between Rab11FIP5 function and the maintenance of the buffering capacity of saliva.",

Originally, STAT proteins were described as \"latent\" cytoplasmic transcription factors as phosphorylation was thought to be required for nuclear retention. However, unphosphorylated STAT proteins also shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus, and play a role in gene expression. Once STAT reaches the nucleus, it binds to a consensus DNA-recognition motif called gamma-activated sites (GAS) in the promoter region of cytokine-inducible genes and activates transcription. The STAT protein can be dephosphorylated by nuclear phosphatases, which leads to inactivation of STAT and subsequent transport out of the nucleus by a exportin-RanGTP complex.",

Using a protein called Nucleoplasmin, the archetypal \u2018molecular chaperone\u2019, they identified a domain in the protein that acts as a signal for nuclear entry. This work stimulated research in the area, and two years later the first NLS was identified in SV40 Large T-antigen (or SV40, for short). However, a functional NLS could not be identified in another nuclear protein simply on the basis of similarity to the SV40 NLS. In fact, only a small percentage of cellular (non-viral) nuclear proteins contained a sequence similar to the SV40 NLS. A detailed examination of Nucleoplasmin identified a sequence with two elements made up of basic amino acids separated by a spacer arm. One of these elements was similar to the SV40 NLS but was not able to direct a protein to the cell nucleus when attached to a non-nuclear reporter protein. Both elements are required. This kind of NLS has become known as a bipartite classical NLS. The bipartite NLS is now known to represent the major class of NLS found in cellular nuclear proteins and structural analysis has revealed how the signal is recognized by a receptor (importin \u03b1) protein (the structural basis of some monopartite NLSs is also known). Many of the molecular details of nuclear protein import are now known. This was made possible by the demonstration that nuclear protein import is a two-step process; the nuclear protein binds to the nuclear pore complex in a process that does not require energy. This is followed by an energy-dependent translocation of the nuclear protein through the channel of the pore complex. By establishing the presence of two distinct steps in the process the possibility of identifying the factors involved was established and led on to the identification of the importin family of NLS receptors and the GTPase Ran.",

HPF and YfiA are structurally similar, and both proteins can bind to the catalytic A- and P-sites of the ribosome. RMF blocks ribosome binding to mRNA by preventing interaction of the messenger with 16S rRNA. When bound to the ribosomes the C-terminal tail of \"E. coli \"YfiA interferes with the binding of RMF, thus preventing dimerization and resulting in the formation of translationally inactive monomeric 70S ribosomes. In addition to ribosome dimerization, the joining of the two ribosomal subunits can be blocked by RsfS (formerly called RsfA or YbeB). RsfS binds to L14, a protein of the large ribosomal subunit, and thereby blocks joining of the small subunit to form a functional 70S ribosome, slowing down or blocking translation entirely. RsfS proteins are found in almost all eubacteria (but not archaea) and homologs are present in mitochondria and chloroplasts (where they are called C7orf30 and \"iojap\", respectively). However, it is not known yet how the expression or activity of RsfS is regulated.",

Ribosomes can bind to a messenger RNA chain and use its sequence for determining the correct sequence of amino acids. Amino acids are selected, collected, and carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which enter one part of the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain. It is during this binding that the correct translation of nucleic acid sequence to amino acid sequence occurs. For each coding triplet in the messenger RNA there is a distinct transfer RNA that matches and which carries the correct amino acid for that coding triplet. The attached amino acids are then linked together by another part of the ribosome.
