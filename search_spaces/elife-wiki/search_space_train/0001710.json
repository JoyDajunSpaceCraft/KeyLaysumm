In experiments on a model organism, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, they found that lowering the availability of glucose extended the lifespan of the worms. It has been known since the 1930s that restricting calories while maintaining adequate amounts of other nutrients extends lifespan across a broad range of organisms. The mechanism has been proposed as a change in the activity of the sirtuins. Michael Ristow shows in his article that this effect can also occur independent of sirtuins, since worms deficient for sirtuins still show extended life span in states of sugar restriction.",

All species have limits of tolerance to abiotic factors, which can lower their survival and reproductive success and limit range expansion beyond the edge. Changes in temperature may cause a species to change its geographical distribution. With increasing temperatures resulting from global warming, species have been seen to expand their range northward due to increased survival and reproduction as a result of warming. Precipitation can also be a key determinant in limiting the geographic range edges of species. This is often seen in organisms with high water demands, whose survival and reproduction would decrease beyond the edge due to dry conditions, limiting expansion. Moisture of soil or air is also seen to limit range expansion. In terms of soil moisture, limited range expansion for species that forage on soil organisms or for species that reside in soil and rely on it for nutrients are seen. If moisture requirements are not met beyond the species range, they will not be able to expand due to resulting reductions in fitness.

Freezing temperatures induce dehydrative stress on plants, as water absorption in the root and water transport in the plant decreases. Water in and between cells in the plant freezes and expands, causing tissue damage. Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate cellular injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures. Non-acclimatized individuals can survive \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C, while a acclimatized individual in the same species can survive \u221230\u00b0. Plants that originated in the tropics, like tomato or maize, don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures. The plant starts the adaptation by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the signal to activate or repress expression of appropriate genes. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the stress, caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living cells. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature stress are shared with other abiotic stresses, like drought or salinity.When temperature drops, the membrane fluidity, RNA and DNA stability, and enzyme activity change. These, in turn, affect transcription, translation, intermediate metabolism, and photosynthesis, leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on \"arabidopsis\" show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the absolute temperature. The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of calcium influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. Calcium channels in the cell membrane detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in \"alfalfa\" and \"arabidopsis\". The response to the change in calcium elevation depends on the cell type and stress history. Shoot tissue will respond more than a root cells, and a cell that already is adapted to cold stress will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn't control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of reactive oxygen species and excitation of photosystem 2, which influences low-temp signal transduction mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation.",

The tissue from the donor embryo was therefore referred to as the inducer because it induced the change.

Plants inhabiting the boreal and polar climates generally tend to be cold-eurythermic, enduring temperatures as cold as \u201385\u00b0, and as warm as at least 20\u00a0\u00b0C, such as boreal deciduous conifers. This is in direct contrast to plants that typically inhabit more tropical or montane regions, where plants may have purely tolerable range between only about 10\u00b0 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, such as the banyan tree. The tolerance for extreme body temperatures in a given eurythermic organism is largely due to an increased temperature tolerance by the respective organism's homologous proteins. In particular, the proteins of a warm-adapted species may be inherently more eurythermal than a cold-adapted species, with warm-adapted species' proteins withstanding higher temperatures before beginning to denature, therefore avoiding possible cell death. Eurythermal species also have shown adaptations in protein synthesis rates compared to non-eurythermal similar species. Rainbow trout\"(Salmo gairdneri\") have shown constant protein synthesis rates formula_1 over temperatures ranging from 5\u00b0 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C, after acclimating to any temperature in this range for 1 month. In contrast, carp (C\"yprinus carpio\"\")\" have shown significantly higher protein synthesis rates after acclimating to higher water temperatures (25\u00a0\u00b0C) than after acclimating to lower water temperatures (10\u00a0\u00b0C). This type of experiment is common throughout fish. A similar example is given by the Senegalese sole (\"Solea senegalensis\"), which, when acclimated to temperatures of 26\u00a0\u00b0C, produced a significantly higher amount of taurine, glutamate, GABA and glycine compared to acclimation to 12\u00a0\u00b0C.

These factors are important to the rate of embryonic development and the success of hatching of the embryos. Food availability also plays an important role in the reproductive cycle of cephalopods. A limitation of food influences the timing of spawning along with their function and growth.

Fast, turbulent streams expose more of the water\u2019s surface area to the air and tend to have low temperatures and thus more oxygen than slow, backwaters. Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, so systems with a high abundance of aquatic algae and plants may also have high concentrations of oxygen during the day.

Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of lotic animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring.

Inorganic substrates are classified by size on the Wentworth scale, which ranges from boulders, to pebbles, to gravel, to sand, and to silt. Typically, particle size decreases downstream with larger boulders and stones in more mountainous areas and sandy bottoms in lowland rivers. This is because the higher gradients of mountain streams facilitate a faster flow, moving smaller substrate materials further downstream for deposition.

The optimum temperature for metabolism and oxygen consumption is between 18\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C. Variations in temperature can also induce a change in hemolymph protein levels along oxygen consumption. As temperature increases, protein concentrations increase in order to accommodate the temperature. Also the cooperativity of hemocyanin increases but the affinity decreases. Conversely, a decrease in temperature results in a decrease in respiratory pigment cooperativity and increase in affinity. The slight rise in P50 that occurs with temperature change allows oxygen pressure to remain high in the capillaries, allowing for elevated diffusion of oxygen into the mitochondria during periods of high oxygen consumption. The increase in temperature results in higher enzyme activity yet the decrease in hemocyanin affinity allows enzyme activity to remain constant and maintain homeostasis. The highest hemolymph protein concentrations are seen at 32\u00a0\u00b0C and then drop at temperatures above this. Oxygen affinity in the blood decreases by 0.20 kPa/\u00b0C at a pH of 7.4.

Depletion of the ozone layer by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming at the top of the stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and oxides of nitrogen. The stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. Hadley cells are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward.

The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment (the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs.

This presents a challenge to the organisms that inhabit such environments because hemoglobin, which normally binds oxygen at high partial pressures of oxygen, must be able to bind oxygen when it is present at a lower pressure. Different organisms have adapted to such a challenge. For example, recent studies have suggested genetic variants in deer mice that help explain how deer mice that live in the mountains are able to survive in the thin air that accompanies high altitudes. A researcher from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found mutations in four different genes that can account for differences between deer mice that live in lowland prairies versus the mountains. After examining wild mice captured from both highlands and lowlands, it was found that: the genes of the two breeds are \"virtually identical\u2014except for those that govern the oxygen-carrying capacity of their hemoglobin\". \"The genetic difference enables highland mice to make more efficient use of their oxygen\", since less is available at higher altitudes, such as those in the mountains. Mammoth hemoglobin featured mutations that allowed for oxygen delivery at lower temperatures, thus enabling mammoths to migrate to higher latitudes during the Pleistocene. This was also found in hummingbirds that inhabit the Andes. Hummingbirds already expend a lot of energy and thus have high oxygen demands and yet Andean hummingbirds have been found to thrive in high altitudes. Non-synonymous mutations in the hemoglobin gene of multiple species living at high elevations (\"Oreotrochilus, A. castelnaudii, C. violifer, P. gigas,\" and \"A. viridicuada\") have caused the protein to have less of an affinity for inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), a molecule found in birds that has a similar role as 2,3-BPG in humans; this results in the ability to bind oxygen in lower partial pressures.",

With no plant life, the animals in this zone are either detritivores, reliant on food drifting down from surface layers, or they are predators, feeding on each other.

A number of deep sea creatures are bioluminescent; this serves a variety of functions including predation, protection and social recognition. In general, the bodies of animals living at great depths are adapted to high pressure environments by having pressure-resistant biomolecules and small organic molecules present in their cells known as piezolytes, which give the proteins the flexibility they need.

In liquid culture Verde1 infected worms stuck together with their tails and formed so called \u201cworm stars\u201d. The trapped worms cannot free themselves and eventually die. After death \"C. elegans\" is then used as a food source for the bacteria. Only larvae in the L4 stage seem to be able to escape by autotomy. They split their bodies into half, so that the anterior half can escape. The \u201chalf-worms\u201d remain viable for several days.  The Gram-positive bacterium \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" is likely associated with \"C. elegans\" in nature. \"B. thuringiensis\" is a soil bacterium that is often used in infection experiments with \"C. elegans\". It produces spore-forming toxins, called crystal (Cry) toxins, which are associated with spores. These are jointly taken up by \"C. elegans\" orally. Inside the host, the toxins bind to the surface of intestinal cells, where the formation of pores in intestinal cells is induced, causing their destruction. The resulting change in milieu in the gut leads to germination of the spores, which subsequently proliferate in the worm body. An interesting aspect of the \"C. elegans\"\u2013\"B. thuringiensis\" system is the high variability in pathogenicity between different strains. There are highly pathogenic strains, but also strains that are less or even non-pathogenic.",

While Gould too is interested in evolvability, the crucial difference between Gould's view, and that of Maynard Smith, Szathmary and Dawkins, is in how they see the spread of complexity. To Gould, complexity drifts upward, having a lower boundary or wall to the left, \"but no upper bound, and these features of complexity are fixed by biochemistry, not the course of evolutionary history\". (p.\u00a0153) Maynard Smith and Szathmary consider that evolutionary history has had upper bounds, or walls to the right. For example, until eukaryotic life evolved, there was an upper bound of complexity set by the intrinsic limits on the size and structural complexity of prokaryotes, and for \"perhaps 2 billion years, bacterial evolution was confined between these two limits.\" (p.\u00a0153) Similarly, until a series of evolutionary innovations facilitated the evolution of multi-celled organisms, eukaryotic complexity was set by the limits on a single eukaryotic cell. \"Maynard Smith and Szathmary argue that social existence, too, has evolutionary preconditions. Until these are met, a wall remains to the right.\" (p.\u00a0153) Whereas to Gould, there are unchanging boundaries set by physics and chemistry, Maynard Smith, Szathmary and Dawkins view evolution as irreversibly transforming these boundaries. \"The eukaryotic cell, sexual reproduction and cellular differentiation all change the nature of evolutionary possibility. These possibilities have changed over time in a direction that increases the maximum attainable complexity. In short, over time the rules of evolution change.\" (pp.\u00a0153\u2013154) So evolvability has changed, with developmental mechanisms determining the variation available to selection. Gould claims that bacteria dominate every age, including this one.* They are the world's most numerous organisms, have the most disparate metabolic pathways, and may constitute most of the world's biomass. \"All this is true and important\", with Dawkins making similar observations.* \"But it is not the whole truth.

The optimum temperature for metabolism and oxygen consumption is between 18\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C. Variations in temperature can also induce a change in hemolymph protein levels along oxygen consumption. As temperature increases, protein concentrations increase in order to accommodate the temperature. Also the cooperativity of hemocyanin increases but the affinity decreases. Conversely, a decrease in temperature results in a decrease in respiratory pigment cooperativity and increase in affinity. The slight rise in P50 that occurs with temperature change allows oxygen pressure to remain high in the capillaries, allowing for elevated diffusion of oxygen into the mitochondria during periods of high oxygen consumption. The increase in temperature results in higher enzyme activity yet the decrease in hemocyanin affinity allows enzyme activity to remain constant and maintain homeostasis. The highest hemolymph protein concentrations are seen at 32\u00a0\u00b0C and then drop at temperatures above this. Oxygen affinity in the blood decreases by 0.20 kPa/\u00b0C at a pH of 7.4. The octopod's thermal tolerance is limited by its ability to consume oxygen, and when it fails to provide enough oxygen to circulate at extreme temperatures the effects can be fatal.

For example, hemoglobin has been found to adapt in different ways to high altitudes. Organisms living at high elevations experience lower partial pressures of oxygen compared to those at sea level. This presents a challenge to the organisms that inhabit such environments because hemoglobin, which normally binds oxygen at high partial pressures of oxygen, must be able to bind oxygen when it is present at a lower pressure. Different organisms have adapted to such a challenge. For example, recent studies have suggested genetic variants in deer mice that help explain how deer mice that live in the mountains are able to survive in the thin air that accompanies high altitudes. A researcher from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found mutations in four different genes that can account for differences between deer mice that live in lowland prairies versus the mountains. After examining wild mice captured from both highlands and lowlands, it was found that: the genes of the two breeds are \"virtually identical\u2014except for those that govern the oxygen-carrying capacity of their hemoglobin\". \"The genetic difference enables highland mice to make more efficient use of their oxygen\", since less is available at higher altitudes, such as those in the mountains. Mammoth hemoglobin featured mutations that allowed for oxygen delivery at lower temperatures, thus enabling mammoths to migrate to higher latitudes during the Pleistocene. This was also found in hummingbirds that inhabit the Andes. Hummingbirds already expend a lot of energy and thus have high oxygen demands and yet Andean hummingbirds have been found to thrive in high altitudes. Non-synonymous mutations in the hemoglobin gene of multiple species living at high elevations (\"Oreotrochilus, A. castelnaudii, C. violifer, P. gigas,\" and \"A. viridicuada\") have caused the protein to have less of an affinity for inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), a molecule found in birds that has a similar role as 2,3-BPG in humans; this results in the ability to bind oxygen in lower partial pressures.",

The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment (the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately , and with prolonged exposure (longer than a few hours) at this temperature and up to around death is almost inevitable. Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above for six hours. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it.

This is in direct contrast to plants that typically inhabit more tropical or montane regions, where plants may have purely tolerable range between only about 10\u00b0 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, such as the banyan tree. The tolerance for extreme body temperatures in a given eurythermic organism is largely due to an increased temperature tolerance by the respective organism's homologous proteins. In particular, the proteins of a warm-adapted species may be inherently more eurythermal than a cold-adapted species, with warm-adapted species' proteins withstanding higher temperatures before beginning to denature, therefore avoiding possible cell death. Eurythermal species also have shown adaptations in protein synthesis rates compared to non-eurythermal similar species.

When the large stores of erythrocytes dips below necessary, the spleen of \"T. carnifex\" will release red blood cells into the blood stream, which is caused by hypoxia or increased metabolic needs. This very specific compensatory respiration \u2013 the ability to adapt to respiratory conditions \u2013 is known as hypoxia, and increases the red blood cells as a method of maintaining oxygen levels in an oxygen-lacking environment. These adaptations have evolved due to both the environment and the physiological conditions the newt finds itself in. This can be seen when the animal releases red blood cells into the bloodstream as a method of maintaining oxygen levels. This feature is commonly shared among amphibians, and it is possible that all ectotherms are capable of this.",

            "document": "Italian crested newt . A minimum of 4000 heartbeats of the newt is the necessary amount for haematological parameters to become stable when there is a shift in respiratory conditions. The colder the temperature, the harder it seems for \"T. carnifex\" to reach this 4000 beat minimum. In an experiment performed by Frangioni et al. it was observed that at 6 degrees Celsius, it took 360 minutes, whereas at 18 degrees Celsius, it only took 150 minutes. When \"T. carnifex\" are in an optimal respiratory environment (that is, exposed to air), they contain low RBC counts, as well as low hematocrit values. This implies that in these conditions, the spleen is very congested. As stated, this is because in areas of high oxygen, the newt is not in hypoxia and does need to compensate for the lack of oxygen in its surroundings. Therefore, release of oxygen from the spleen is unnecessary and not triggered. The opposite is seen when the animal is placed in a hypoxic environment. There is a release of erythrocytes from the spleen and the values in the blood are raised to high. Every time there is an increase in blood volume (created by the release of erythrocytes), there is an increase in blood pressure, and therefore they are said to have a direct relationship. Thus, if one increases, so will the other. Besides blood volume, a factor affecting blood pressure is the temperature. At lower temperatures, the newts will have a lower blood pressure, and the opposite is true for a higher temperature. Another factor is the congestion of the spleen. When congestion of the spleen rises, the pressure will fall; and vice versa. During hypoxia, there is a great deal of arterial pressure which appears when there is a quick change from an oxygenated environment to a hypoxic one. That increase is due to the swift decongestion of the spleen as it releases erythrocytes into the bloodstream to allow respiration within the newt. However, this increase in pressure occurred only at the 6 degree and 12 degree mark; at 18 degrees the blood actually decreased. This suggests that even though blood pressure is key in determining respiratory compensation, it is by no means the only factor, or even the most important. Although there is a decrease in blood at 18 degrees, the spleen is still emptied (as it is at any temperature). There \"is\" a decrease in blood plasma when this occurs so as to keep blood volume at a constant, or even a lowered value. In well oxygenated environments, temperature can be seen working alone, without the added challenge of a hypoxic environment. When an increase in temperature occurs in the surrounding environment of a newt, this increases metabolic activity. When there is such an increase, the spleen will empty itself of erythrocytes and the volume of red blood cells will go up. This is to assist with the greater need for consumption of oxygen. In a high temperature environment where \"T. carnifex\" is exposed to air, it can be expected that there will be a large increase in blood volume. However, the blood plasma will decrease and prevent an increase in blood pressure. In terms of compartmentalization of the newt\u2019s respiratory systems, the systemic (lungs) and cutaneous (skin) systems work and function independently. Despite this, there is a very high correlation between the two with respect to their abilities in times of hypoxia. Both systems attempt to obtain as much oxygen as possible \u2013 cutaneous through vasodilation, and systemic through splenic decongestion.",

There are a number of anaerobic organism that are involved in the process of anaerobic digestion including acetic acid-forming bacteria (acetogens) and methane-forming (methanogens). These organisms feed upon the initial feedstock, which undergoes a number of different processes converting it to intermediate molecules including sugars, hydrogen, and acetic acid, before finally being converted to biogas. Different species of bacteria are able to survive at different temperature ranges. Ones living optimally at temperatures between 35\u201340 \u00b0C are called mesophiles or mesophilic bacteria. Some of the bacteria can survive at the hotter and more hostile conditions of 55\u201360 \u00b0C, these are called thermophile.Methanogens come from the domain of archaea. This family includes species that can grow in the hostile conditions of hydrothermal vents. These species are more resistant to heat and can therefore operate at high temperatures, a property that is unique to thermophile. As with aerobic systems the bacteria in anaerobic systems the growing and reproducing microorganisms within them require a source of elemental oxygen to survive. In an anaerobic system there is an absence of gaseous oxygen. Gaseous oxygen is prevented from entering the system through physical containment in sealed tanks. Anaerobes access oxygen from sources other than the surrounding air. The oxygen source for these microorganisms can be the organic material itself or alternatively may be supplied by inorganic oxides from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, then the 'intermediate' end products are primarily alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide with trace levels of hydrogen sulfide.In an anaerobic system the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane. Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective. It is therefore common practice to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations, a process known as \"seeding\" the digesters, and typically takes place with the addition of sewage sludge or cattle slurry.",

Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of lotic animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring.

Inorganic substrates are classified by size on the Wentworth scale, which ranges from boulders, to pebbles, to gravel, to sand, and to silt.

This same transition in gill morphology occurs in the goldfish when the temperature was raised from 7.5\u00a0\u00b0C to 15\u00a0\u00b0C. This difference may be due to the temperature regimes that these fish are typically found in, or there could be an underlying protective mechanism to prevent a loss of ion balance in stressful temperatures. Temperature also affects the speed at which the gills can be remodelled: for example, at 20\u00a0\u00b0C in hypoxia, the crucian carp can completely remove its ILCM in 6 hours, whereas at 8\u00a0\u00b0C, the same process takes 3\u20137 days.

            "document": "Philodendron . The male beetles will stay overnight in the spathe, eating and mating throughout the night due to the benefits provided by the spathe and spadix. Typically, five to 12 beetles will be within the spathe throughout the night. Rarely, cases of 200 beetles at a time have been observed and almost always the beetles are of the same species. Another interesting feature of this symbiotic relationship, less well understood, is the series of events in which the spadix begins to heat up prior to the spathe opening up for the beetles. This process is known as thermogenesis. By the time the spathe is open and the beetles have arrived, the spadix is usually quite hot; up to around 46\u00a0\u00b0C in some species, but usually around 35\u00a0\u00b0C. The thermogenesis coincides with the arrival of the beetles and appears to increase their presence. The maximum temperature reached by the spadix remains about 20\u00a0\u00b0C higher than the outside ambient temperature. The time dependence of the temperature can vary from species to species. In some species, the temperature of the spadix will peak on the arrival of the beetles, then decrease, and finally increase reaching a maximum once again when the philodendron is ready for the beetles to leave. Other species, though, only show a maximum temperature on the arrival of the beetles, which remains roughly constant for about a day, and then steadily decreases. A few species will show three peaks in temperature during the flowering. The increased temperature increases the metabolism of the beetles, causing them to move about more within the spathe and increasing the likelihood they will be sufficiently coated with pollen. A sticky resin is also produced in drops attached to the spadix which help to keep the pollen attached to the beetles. This resin producing quality is unique to \"Philodendron\" and \"Monstera\", as other genera of Araceae do not produce it on their spadices. The resin is also found on the stems, leaves, and roots of philodendrons. Its color can be red, orange, yellow, or colorless when it is first produced. Yet, over time, it will turn brown as it is exposed to air. Also, some evidence suggests the thermogenesis triggers the beetles to mate. It also appears to distribute the pheromones into the air. The reason for the spadix being held at 45\u00b0 relative to the spathe may be to maximize the heat's ability to waft the pheromones into the air. Oxidizing stored carbohydrates and lipids has been found to be the energy source for thermogenesis. The part of the spadix that heats up is the sterile zone. As it heats up, carbohydrates are used, but once the spadix has reached its maximum temperature, lipids are oxidized. The lipids are not first converted to carbohydrates, but rather are directly oxidized. The thermogenic reaction is triggered when concentrations of acetosalicytic acid form in the sterile zone. The acid sets off the mitochondria in the cells that make up the sterile zone to switch to an electron transport chain called the cyanide-resistant pathway, which results in the production of heat. Philodendrons consume oxygen during thermogenesis. The rate at which oxygen is used is remarkably high, close to that of hummingbirds and sphinx moths. The spadix has been shown to generate infrared radiation. As the beetles home in on the inflorescence, they first move in a zig-zag pattern until they get reasonably close, when they switch to a straight-line path. The beetles may be using scent to find the inflorescence when they are far away, but once within range, they find it by means of the infrared radiation. This would account for the two different types of paths the beetles follow.",

Freezing temperatures induce dehydrative stress on plants, as water absorption in the root and water transport in the plant decreases.

Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate cellular injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures. Non-acclimatized individuals can survive \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C, while a acclimatized individual in the same species can survive \u221230\u00b0. Plants that originated in the tropics, like tomato or maize, don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures. The plant starts the adaptation by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the signal to activate or repress expression of appropriate genes. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the stress, caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living cells. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature stress are shared with other abiotic stresses, like drought or salinity.When temperature drops, the membrane fluidity, RNA and DNA stability, and enzyme activity change. These, in turn, affect transcription, translation, intermediate metabolism, and photosynthesis, leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on \"arabidopsis\" show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the absolute temperature. The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of calcium influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. Calcium channels in the cell membrane detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in \"alfalfa\" and \"arabidopsis\". The response to the change in calcium elevation depends on the cell type and stress history. Shoot tissue will respond more than a root cells, and a cell that already is adapted to cold stress will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before.

Some of the biological processes which alter the concentrations of dissolved oxygen include photosynthesis and aquatic organism respiration. Due to the role that photosynthesis plays in dissolved oxygen concentrations in a body of water. Oxygen profiles are affected by photosynthesis, wind mixing of surface waters, and respiration or organic matter, such that oxygen declines similar to the temperature profile. These profiles are based on similar principles as thermal stratification and light penetration. Since dissolved oxygen concentrations are driven primarily by photosynthesis, the amount of sunlight is a limiting factor in terms of how much photosynthesis can occur within the different levels of the water column where light is readily available. This means that dissolved oxygen levels are generally lower as you move deeper into the body of water because of the lower availability of light in those parts of the water.",

Growth is slow when temperatures are below 5\u00baC. At 5-15\u00baC the growth of \"C. nivalis\" cells can outperform the growth of C. reinhardtii cells. Both species grow at the same rate at 20-25\u00baC. The growth of \"C. nivalis\" is suppressed when temperatures rise above 30\u00baC. It is a true snow alga because it performs better in low temperatures than warm temperatures. Due to \"C. nivalis\"\u2019 ability to perform photosynthesis well from cold to moderate temperatures, this species is considered a cryotolerant mesophile rather than a cryophile. This organism is also very resilient as they can also survive in warm soil for weeks. They can also tolerate dryness and room temperature for as long as 6 months.",

            "document": "Robustness (evolution) . In varying environments, perfect adaptation to one condition may come at the expense of adaptation to another. Consequently, the total selection pressure on an organism is the average selection across all environments weighted by the percentage time spent in that environment. Variable environment can therefore select for environmental robustness where organisms can function across a wide range of conditions with little change in phenotype or fitness (biology). Some organisms show adaptations to tolerate large changes in temperature, water availability, salinity or food availability. Plants, in particular, are unable to move when the environment changes and so show a range of mechanisms for achieving environmental robustness. Similarly, this can be seen in proteins as tolerance to a wide range of solvents, ion concentrations or temperatures.",

A wide range of organisms may have survived in the subsurface, such as chemolithotrophs and lithoautotrophs, and certain extremophiles like halophiles or psychrophiles. Microbes found on Earth have been discovered thriving in near-freezing temperatures and very low-oxygen air. This allows researchers to believe that organisms can live in similar extreme situations such as those on Mars where temperatures are colder and less oxygen is available. Volcanic minerals found in lava tubes could provide a rich source of nutrients to chemosynthetic organisms. Scientists are also interested in gaining access to Martian lava tubes because they could give insight into the processes that led to life on Earth since the geologic rock record is better preserved on Mars.",

            "document": "Local adaptation . Local adaptation is when a population of organisms has evolved to be more well-suited to its environment than other members of the same species. This occurs due to differential pressures of natural selection on populations from different environments. For example, populations of a species that lives within a wide range of temperatures may be locally adapted to the warmer or cooler climate where they live. More formally, a population is said to be locally adapted if organisms in that population have differentially evolved as compared to other populations within their species in response to selective pressures imposed by some aspect of their local environment. Local adaptation is often determined via reciprocal transplant experiments, where organisms from one population are transplanted into another population, and vice versa, and their fitnesses measured. If the transplanted organisms have lower fitness in the novel environment, than the native population can be said to be locally adapted.",
