Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.",

There are also several species of insectivore in England and the rest of Britain. The hedgehog is probably the most widely known as it is a regular visitor to urban gardens. Sadly it is also vulnerable to road traffic, and many are killed crossing busy motorways and dual carriageways. The mole is also widely recognised and its subterranean lifestyle causes much damage to garden lawns and some gardeners trap or kill them (although this is illegal). Shrews are also fairly common, and the smallest, the pygmy shrew, is one of the smallest mammals in the world. There are also several species of bat found in England: the pipistrelle bat is the smallest and the most common of them all. Rodents are also numerous across Britain and England, particularly the brown rat which is by far the most abundant urban animal after humans. Some however, are becoming increasingly rare. Habitat destruction has led to a population decrease in the number of dormice and bank voles found in Britain.",

Though there is no immediate threat to the southern torrent salamander, urbanization is beginning to encroach on its habitat. Direct effects from logging and disturbing forests with the building of roads and other man-made features are limiting the habitable areas for these salamanders. Other indirect effects from urbanization are those that are affecting the temperature of the environment. \"R. variegatus\" is extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuations, having a very narrow range of temperatures in which it can thrive. The salamanders will begin to show temperature stress at about 63\u00a0\u00b0F. If the temperature of mountain streams and brooks rises over the next few years, the species will either have to adapt or succumb to the warm temperature. In California, \"R. variegatus\" is a Species of Special Concern. The composition of the ground in the habitat is also quite important. If the texture of the components is too fine, then the environment would not be ideal. \"R. variegatus\" needs large, pebble-like particles to be able to hide and avoid predators.

A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs may account for the higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas.

They may inhabit a majority of the world's terrestrial habitats, with the majority of species being largely forest dwelling, but several preferring most kinds of open habitat from steppe to prairie to tundra as well as most rocky or mountainous areas. By far the widest ranging species of booted eagle is the golden eagle, which is distributed in much of North America (where it is the only species of the subfamily) and more than half of Eurasia, often along most mountainous terrains therein but also most semi-open ranges. So-called \"hawk-eagles\" are forest dwelling booted eagle types largely represented by \"Spizaetus\" (in the neotropics) and \"Nisaetus\" (in Asia). Despite many similar features in the two main hawk-eagle genera, they apparently evolved separately for some time and are not closely related. The peak diversity for Aquilinae are in Africa, where nearly half of extant species are known to dwell at least seasonally, exploiting a diversity of different hunting styles, habitats, nesting habits and general body forms. Most booted eagle species are opportunistic predators which prey mostly on small vertebrates, often subsisting on a wide range of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians as they become locally available or abundant (carrion is also rarely ignored). Species favoring more open habitats tend to hunt most often on the wing, using distance or hugging contours of the ground to surprise prey. Forest dwelling species are more likely to be perch-hunters, watching for prey activity from a high tree perch, but almost every kind of booted eagle can vary their hunting techniques when necessary. In cases where they become specialists, booted eagles tend to be mammal hunters, such as the considerable dependence of Spanish imperial eagle (\"Aquila adalberti\") on rabbits, of breeding steppe eagle (\"Aquila nipalensis\") on sousliks or Verreaux's eagle (\"Aquila verreauxii\") on hyraxes. Exceptions include the Ayres's hawk-eagle (\"Hieraaetus ayresii\") and, to a lesser extent, the rufous-bellied eagle (\"Lophotriorchis kienerii\"), both of which are smallish, swift-flying bird-hunting specialists who dive (falcon-like) on woodland birds while the black eagle (\"Ictinaetus malaiensis\") feeds mostly only on the contents of other birds' nests (the only known bird specialized to do so). Most but not all booted eagle species have relatively large feet and talons and can routinely go after prey as large or larger than themselves, even some smaller species can routinely hunt prey up to two to three times their own weight. Rare attacks on large prey, such as ungulates, adult monkeys or medium-sized carnivores or other much larger animals, almost always involve the larger species of booted eagle, whereas such attacks are exceptionally rare to non-existent in eagles of other lineages. At least four large booted eagles have been known to dispatch prey weighing or more.",

Once resources for food, nesting, and potential mates become scarce in a particular area, birds and other animals move out of those areas to find new resources. Range expansion is a crucial component of evolution; however expansions are presently occurring at an alarming rate. One of the reasons for increased expansion is due to human alteration. Human causes such as changing of habitat and global climate change are leading factors in avian range expansion. Species that were previously adapted to the old niche are often replaced by species that are more adapted for newly created niche. For example, when forests are replaced by more urban areas, species such as the Inca dove are replaced by the mourning dove, allowing the mourning dove to expand its range. Bird populations are not static and naturally change over time. However, due to human effects such as global climate change and loss of habitat, a number of species are expanding in a particular range as the native species they displace are declining.  In addition to environmental aspects that cause range expansion and subsequent decline of certain species, humans have introduced species that are largely responsible for decline of native species. Exotic species, such as the European starling which were introduced by Eugene Schieffelin in 1890 in New York City and then expanded to California by 1955, often do very well in new habitats. The lack of predators and new niche offer perfect conditions for the introduced species to flourish. These \"exotic\" species often displace other native species. For example, the European starling pursues aggressive breeding strategies that help it colonize new breeding areas. The European starling is an early breeder and out competes other native cavity nesters for nesting sites. Other cavity nesters include the kestrels, flycatchers, swallows, wrens, and bluebirds. The urbanization of much America also aids in the spread of the European starling (Podluka et al. 2004, Askins 2000, Elrich et al. 1998).",

Numbers have since recovered as a result of conservation measures. Its range has expanded as far north as southern Canada. However, in some parts of the southern United States, its numbers have declined due to habitat loss, particularly wetland degradation through drainage, grazing, clearing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants. Nevertheless, the species adapts well to human habitation and can be readily seen near wetlands and bodies of water in urban and suburban areas.",

Habitats with high levels of disturbance are much more likely to be invaded by a non-native species because a highly disturbed habitat is one that is always changing, so the introduction of a non-native species is not something that that is extremely difficult. In order for successful invasion of a natural community to occur, it requires dispersal, establishment, and survival. The specific ecosystems in the United States that are among the most heavily invaded are located in Hawaii, Florida, and California. Specifically, the grasslands and valleys of California have been so heavily invaded by non-native species, that this habitat has been completely altered, and the original habitat composition and structure are not known because of how different it is now. In this same region, the southwest pi\u00f1on-juniper woodlands have only experienced light habitat invasion from non-natives. It was also found that large oceanic bays such as the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia and the San Francisco bay in California now contain more non-native species than native species that the habitat originated with.

Due to a hotspot's great diversity and endemic species, conservation biology and many other sources conduct research in these locations. Research is also needed considering the amount of threatened species in hotspots. Researchers have the opportunity to preserve many species along with their habitats within hotspots. Some organizations that use hotspots for research are World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Birdlife International, Conservation International, and World Wildlife Fund. Research is also done on humans' impact to the hotspots land and species that reside in them. Funding for hotspot conservation has been estimated at $750 million accumulated over the past fifteen years.{when|date=May 2018}} By focusing research on hotspots, many species can be helped at once. One specific research studies fire's impact on vegetation in Northern Ecuador of the Tropical Andes. This location's variety of vegetation includes different forests, land used for agricultural and p\u00e1ramo, or tropical alpine found at 4,500 meters. P\u00e1ramo is dominated by grasses but still high in diversity. The article \"Fire Ecology and Conservation in the High Tropical Andes: Observations from Northern Ecuador\" looks at p\u00e1ramo's ability to withstand disturbances such as fire. Humans have lived in this location for 7,000 years, and the p\u00e1ramo has been through fires and grazing. The writer believes that policies used to implement fire suppression are not probable or beneficiary to the plant. Policies instead should be written up according to specific plant species and impact on natives living there. This is a small example of research in the Tropical Andes that could make a big impact to saving diversity. Further research is also processed on looking into the decrease in avian populations, focusing in hotspots due to its massive diversity. The study focuses in Endemic Bird Areas or EBAs in order to understand why they become extinct and possible conservation plans. there were 218 EBAs, with over 30 percent of bird species threatened. EBAs located in hotspots interfere with many human activities, leading to habitat loss in 51 percent of EBAs. According to the article's chart, five EBAs with habitat loss are located in the Tropical Andes. By studying the effect of human activities on EBAs that are losing avian populations, plans to help the future of other EBAs are possible. Their results showed that if a species has habitat specificity and is large in size, the chance of extinction increases. Habitat loss will impact those with habitat specificity greatly. Conservation goals need to look into human activities and the bird's habitat specificity in order to make a positive impact. An example of research on a specific threatened species in the Tropical Andes is the rare \"Tremarctos ornatus\", also known as Andean (or spectacled) bears. Two males were captured, and radio collars were attached in order to track and study their habits and movement. They portrayed similar patterns compared to many other bear species. These findings contrasted with the belief of spectacled bears being nocturnal and no change in patterns between seasons because only slight change in temperature. The radio collars proved these spectacled bears to be diurnal. The bears were in motion from sunrise to sunset with periods of rest in between. There was a small change in level of activity between seasons, with an increase during the dry season. Due to the technology of radio collars, hypotheses about these bears were tested. By knowing their habitat and lifestyle, we can better understand and help threatened species.",

In most foreign nations including New Zealand, the grey house spider is a synanthropic species and is common in urban habitats and agroecosystems. The species resides almost exclusively in the somewhat artificial environments that are produced as a result of human inhabitancy, and not in wild habitats, for example natural forest. The distinctively messy web of \"B. longinqua\" can be found in many urban places, such as nooks and crannies on window frames and walls, in rubbish bins, under furniture, on car bodies and mirrors, trees bases and benches in urban parks, and artificial posies in cemeteries. \"Badumna longinqua\" have also been found in cemeteries in artificial flowers, which therefore suggest that they are very suitable to refuge. The species primarily are found living in tree trunks, rock walls, retreats, leaves, and tangled webbing in green shrubs. \"Badumna longinqua\" live in grasslands, riparian forests and wetlands. Higher densities of the species populations are found in trees near roads or urban areas where human activity is higher. Commercial \"Eucalyptus\" plantations in Uruguay, and \"Pinus\" plantations elsewhere provide an abundance of potential homes for the spiders, which often take up residence on the trees, positioning their hideaways under loose bark. In the United States, \"Badumna longinqua\" seems to be less reliant on a synanthropic relationship with people and can also be located in woodlands, along immediate coastal areas, within agricultural ecosystems, and recently in vineyards.",

Other plants species include many crops such as tobacco and potatoes. Some endemic animals include the Andean condor, which almost became extinct from hunting. Thanks to a conservation reintroduction program, their numbers are growing. Another threatened endemic bird in the Tropical Andes is the yellow-eared parrot. One threat this species faces is the loss of the vulnerable wax palm. The yellow-eared parrot uses the wax palm for nesting and roosting. However, humans, especially in Colombia, are removing the vulnerable wax palm from the wild for Palm Sunday. Some conservation programs are helping the situation to educate churches to use other resources besides the vulnerable wax palm. The yellow tailed monkey is another endemic animal being endangered.

Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs may account for the higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas.
