The protein encoded by this gene has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and also acts as a scaffold to stabilize additional protein interactions with the transcription complex. This protein acetylates both histone and non-histone proteins. This protein shares regions of very high-sequence similarity with protein EP300 in its bromodomain, cysteine-histidine-rich regions, and histone acetyltransferase domain.

Their N-ZnF (i.e. N-terminus zinc fingers) interacts with an essential transcription factor-regulating nuclear protein, FOG1. FOG1 powerfully promotes or suppresses the actions that the two transcription factors have on most of their target genes. Similar to the knockout of \"Gata1\", knockout of the mouse gene for FOG1, \"Zfpm1\", causes total failure of red blood cell development and embryonic lethality by day 11.5. Based primarily on mouse studies, it is proposed that the GATA1-FOG1 complex promotes human erythropoiesis by recruiting and binding with at least two gene expression-regulating complexes, Mi-2/NuRD complex (a chromatin remodeler) and CTBP1 (a histone deacetylase) and three gene expression-regulating proteins, SET8 (a GATA1-inhibiting histone methyltransferase), BRG1 (a transcription activator), and Mediator (a transcription co-activator).

Transcriptional initiation, termination and regulation are mediated by \u201cDNA looping\u201d which brings together promoters, enhancers, transcription factors and RNA processing factors to accurately regulate gene expression. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) and more recently Hi-C techniques provided evidence that active chromatin regions are \u201ccompacted\u201d in nuclear domains or bodies where transcriptional regulation is enhanced24614317. The configuration of the genome is essential for enhancer-promoter proximity. Cell-fate decisions are mediated upon highly dynamic genomic reorganizations at interphase to modularly switch on or off entire gene regulatory networks through short to long range chromatin rearrangements. Related studies demonstrate that metazoan genomes are partitioned in structural and functional units around a megabase long called Topological association domains (TADs) containing dozens of genes regulated by hundreds of enhancers distributed within large genomic regions containing only non-coding sequences. The function of TADs is to regroup enhancers and promoters interacting together within a single large functional domain instead of having them spread in different TADs. However, studies of mouse development point out that two adjacent TADs may regulate the same gene cluster. The most relevant study on limb evolution shows that the TAD at the 5\u2019 of the HoxD gene cluster in tetrapod genomes drives its expression in the distal limb bud embryos, giving rise to the hand, while the one located at 3\u2019 side does it in the proximal limb bud, giving rise to the arm. Still, it is not known whether TADs are an adaptive strategy to enhance regulatory interactions or an effect of the constrains on these same interactions. TAD boundaries are often composed by housekeeping genes, tRNAs, other highly expressed sequences and Short Interspersed Elements (SINE). While these genes may take advantage of their border position to be ubiquitously expressed, they are not directly linked with TAD edge formation. The specific molecules identified at boundaries of TADs are called insulators or architectural proteins because they not only block enhancer leaky expression but also ensure an accurate compartmentalization of cis-regulatory inputs to the targeted promoter. These insulators are DNA-binding proteins like CTCF and TFIIIC that help recruiting structural partners such as cohesins and condensins. The localization and binding of architectural proteins to their corresponding binding sites is regulated by post-translational modifications. DNA binding motifs recognized by architectural proteins are either of high occupancy and at around a megabase of each other or of low occupancy and inside TADs. High occupancy sites are usually conserved and static while intra-TADs sites are dynamic according to the state of the cell therefore TADs themselves are compartmentalized in subdomains that can be called subTADs from few kb up to a TAD long (19). When architectural binding sites are at less than 100 kb from each other, Mediator proteins are the architectural proteins cooperate with cohesin. For subTADs larger than 100 kb and TAD boundaries, CTCF is the typical insulator found to interact with cohesion.",

            "document": "Cellular differentiation . Each specialized cell type in an organism expresses a subset of all the genes that constitute the genome of that species. Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell. Cells and tissues can vary in competence, their ability to respond to external signals.",

It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a methylase domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in methylation state of DNA in that region will subsequently result. Transcription rates of genes so-affected will be reduced. Many of the effector domains function to modulate either the DNA directly - e.g. via methylation, cleaving, or recombination of the target DNA sequence - or by modulating its transcription rate - e.g. inhibiting transcription via repressor domains that block transcriptional machinery, promoting transcription with activation domains that recruit transcriptional machinery to the site, or histone- or other epigenetic-modification domains that affect chromatin state and the ability of transcriptional machinery to access the affected genes. Epigenetic modification is a major theme in determining varying expression levels for genes, as explained by the idea that how tightly-wound the DNA strand is - from histones at the local level up to chromatin at the chromosomal level - can influence the accessibility of sequences of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing the rate at which it can be transcribed. If, instead of impacting the DNA strand directly, as described above, a designer zinc-finger protein instead affects epigenetic modification state for a target DNA region, modulation of gene expression could similarly be accomplished. In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression in vivo, Choo \"et al\" designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. This specific oncogene is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The oncogene typically enables leukemia cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of cancer. By including a nuclear localization signal with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo \"et al\" were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo.

The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport. NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin.

            "document": "Molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of alcoholism . In coordination with the molecules and pathways discussed, epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the development of alcoholism. These mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation, and (microRNA miRNA) action. Methylation of the DNA typically occurs at CpG sites, or a cysteine nucleotide followed by a guanine nucleotide in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction. These sites are common promoter and regulatory elements in mammals and methylation of cysteine residues typically inhibits these functions resulting in the repression of gene expression. DNA methylation is carried out by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are recruited to CpG sites by methyl-DNA binding proteins, such as MeCP2. Next, histones can be modified in several ways to increase or decrease gene expression. Histones are protein complexes used to package DNA into structures known as nucleosomes. The level of coiling of the DNA around histones is variable and influences transcription levels. Tight coiling, or heterochromatin, is associated with low gene expression or even silencing. Loose coiling, or euchromatin, is associated with higher levels of gene expression. Typically, acetylation of histones is associated with euchromatin formation. Acetyl groups are added by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as CBP. In opposition, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups, typically leading to the formation of heterochromatin. HDACs are recruited by scaffolding proteins, such as RACK 1. HDAC inhibitors prevent HDAC functioning which promotes gene expression. Histone methylation, adding a methyl group to specific histone protein amino acids, can both increase or decrease gene expression depending on the histone protein, amino acid, and number of methyl groups used. Gene expression can also be inhibited post-transcriptionally by miRNA, double-stranded RNA, typically formed from hairpin structures, that is used to inhibit translation of proteins. After processing by the RNA interference (RNAi) molecules Drosha and Dicer, a single, guide-strand is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which is used to bind mRNA. This binding suppresses protein synthesis and sometimes initiates mRNA degradation.",

The gene codes for a transcription factor protein, ETV6, which acts to inhibit the expression of various genes which in mice appear to be required for normal hematopoiesis and the development and maintenance of the vascular network. The gene is located on human chromosome 12 at position p13.2 and is well-known to be involved in a large number of chromosomal rearrangements associated with leukemia and congenital fibrosarcoma. Heterozygous \"ETV6\" germline mutations have been identified in several families with inherited thrombocytopenia, variable red blood cell macrocytosis, and hematologic malignancies, primarily B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The \"ACSL6\" gene encodes a protein, CSL6 acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 6 (or ACSL6 protein). This protein is a Long-chain-fatty-acid\u2014CoA ligase that plays a major role in fatty acid metabolism (particularly in the brain) by charging fatty acids with Coenzyme A to form acyl-CoA. This function can not only alter fatty acid metabolism but also modulate the function of protein kinase Cs and nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. The gene is located on human chromosome 5 at position q31.1. Chromosome translocations between \"ETV6\" and \"ACSL6\" at different chromosome break points create various t(5:12)(q31;p13) \"ETV6-ACSL6\" fusion genes encoding ETV6-ACSL6 fusion proteins. The functionality of ETV6-ACSL6 fusion proteins and the mechanism by which they promote clonal hypereosinophil may, based on indirect evidence in 5 case studies, relate to a loss or gain in function of the ETV6 portion of the fusion protein. However, these issues have not been fully investigated or defined. Two cases involving \"ETV6-ACSL6\" fusion genes were associated with the ectopic and uncontrolled expression of Interleukin 3. The gene for interleukin 3 is close to the \"ACSL6\" gene at position 5q31 and could also be mutated during at least some \"ETV6-ACSL6\" translocation events. Interleukin 3 stimulates the activation, growth, and survival of eosinophils and therefore its mutation could be involved in the clonal hypereosinophilia occurring in \"ETV6-ACSL6\"-related disease.",

Transcription may produce so called noncoding RNA products such as tRNA and regulatory RNA. Repression may refer to the decrease in transcription of a gene or inhibition of a protein. Proteins are often inhibited by binding the active site or causing a conformational change so that the active site can no longer bind. By making these alterations, proteins, like transcription factors, may bind DNA less or some protein may be inhibited so that it becomes a block in a signaling cascade and certain genes will then not be induced to be expressed. Repression can occur pre- or post-transcriptionally. Methylating the DNA or the modifying the histones that the DNA wraps around is one example that commonly leads to repression. Pre-transcriptional repression can also occur by altering the proteins that allow transcription to occur, namely the polymerase complex. Proteins can sit on the DNA strand and serve as a kind of block to polymerase proteins, halting them from transcribing. Post-transcriptional repression generally refers to the degradation of the RNA product or binding the RNA with proteins so that it cannot be translated or carry out its function.",

The most comprehensive study which was published in 2003, identified mice orthologue of human JADE1, Jade1, and investigated Jade1 expression during mice embryogenesis. Searching for developmentally regulated genes the authors used gene trap screen analysis and identified mouse Jade1 as gene strongly regulated during embryogenesis. Insertion of the vector into the third intron of the Jade1 gene lead to the production of a 47-amino-acid truncated protein. The gene trap insertional mutation resulted in Jade1-beta-galactosidase reporter fusion product and Jade1 null allele. While the homozygotes for the gene trap integration did not produce strong developmental phenotype, the fusion product revealed Jade1 gene spatial-temporal expression in mouse embryonic cells and tissues of developing embryo up to 15.5-d.p.c. In addition the study reports experimental and in silico comparative analysis of Jade1 mRNA transcripts, Jade1 gene structure and analysis of Jade1 protein orthologues from mouse human and zebra fish. Jade1 expression was detected in extraembryonic ectoderm and trophoblast, which are placental components important for vasculogenesis, as well as in sites enriched with multipotent or tissue-specific progenitors, including neural progenitors(2). The dynamics of Jade1 reporter expression in these areas indicates the involvement in the determination and elongation of anterior posterior axis, an important point of the study). The potential role for human JADE1 in the renewal of embryonic stem cell and embryonal carcinoma cell cultures was suggested in another screening study which showed that, in cultured stem cells activation of stem cell transcription factor OCT4 pathway upregulated JADE1 gene expression along with stem cell factors NANOG, PHC1, USP44 and SOX2. Role of JADE1 in epithelial cell proliferation was addressed in a murine model of acute kidney injury and regeneration. Expression patterns and dynamics of HBO1-JADE1S/L were examined in regenerating tubular epithelial cells. Ischemia and reperfusion injury resulted in an initial decrease in JADE1S, JADE1L, and HBO1 protein levels, which returned to the baseline during renal recovery. Expression levels of HBO1 and JADE1S recovered as cell proliferation rate reached maximum, whereas JADE1L recovered after bulk proliferation had diminished. The temporal expression of JADE1 correlated with the acetylation of histone H4 (H4K5 and H4K12) but not that of histone H3 (H4K14), suggesting that the JADE1-HBO1 complex specifically marks H4 during epithelial cell proliferation. The results of the study implicate JADE1-HBO1 complex in acute kidney injury and suggest distinct roles for JADE1 isoforms during epithelial cell recovery.",

Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is a dimeric glycoprotein that plays a significant role in neurons and is considered to be the main, dominant inducer to the growth of blood vessels. VEGFA is essential for adults during organ remodeling and diseases that involve blood vessels, for example, in wound healing, tumor angiogenesis, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. During early vertebrate development, vasculogenesis occurs which means that the endothelial condense into the blood vessels. The differentiation of endothelial cells is dependent upon the expression of VEGFA and if the expression is abolished then it can result in the death of the embryo. VEGFA is produced by a group of three major isoforms as a result of alternative splicing and if any three isoforms are produced (VEGFA120, VEGFA164, and VEGFA188) then this will not result in vessel defects and death of the full VEGFA knockout in mice. VEGFA is essential in the role of neurons because they too need vascular supply and abolishing the expression of VEGFA from neural progenitors will result in defects of the brain vascularization and neuronal apoptosis. Anti-VEGFA therapy can be used to treat patients with undesirable angiogenesis and vascular leakage in cancer and eye diseases but also could result in the inhibition of neurogenesis and neuroprotection. VEGFA could be used to treat patients with neurodegenerative and neuropathic conditions and also increase vascular permeability which will stop the blood-brain barrier and increase inflammatory cell infiltration.

Unlike normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are dilated with an irregular shape. In 2007, it was discovered that cancerous cells stop producing the anti-VEGF enzyme PKG. In normal cells (but not in cancerous ones), PKG apparently limits beta-catenin, which solicits angiogenesis. Other clinicians believe angiogenesis really serves as a waste pathway, taking away the biological end products secreted by rapidly dividing cancer cells. In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be about the size of the metal ball at the end of a ball-point pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or metastasis. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of endothelial cells and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies.

PcG proteins have been found to associate with such genes, serving to either directly or indirectly alter their levels of expression through epigenetic modifications. c-Myc is a canonical oncogene that has been shown to associate with members of the PcG proteins. Normally, c-Myc is highly expressed in immature cells but has almost no perceivable expression in mature/differentiated cells. Its roles in the cell cycle and apoptosis help cells maintain an immature state, and its expression wanes as cells begin to differentiate. Bmi-1 and Myc were found to be partners within the cell nucleus. Interestingly, Bmi-1 and c-Myc seem to function in tandem in multiple ways. Studies have found that together c-Myc and Bmi-1 possess the ability to alter tumor suppressor genes. Hypoactive c-Myc was shown to alter p16 via Bmi-1, while hyperactive c-Myc was capable of altering the p16 promoter itself [28]. Normally, p16 functions to prevent cells from progressing through the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle too quickly. Altering this function helps drive cells to proliferate uncontrollably making them more tumorigenic in nature. Hence, these data present a model in which c-Myc and Bmi-1 alter cellular apoptosis via cell cycle regulator genes. Conversely, another protein has been shown to alter Bmi-1 in such a way that negates its association with c-Myc and ultimately reduces its tumorigenic capacity. Researchers found that Akt phosphorylate Bmi-1 at Serine 316 (Ser316), thus inhibiting its chromatin-modifying function, suppressing its growth-promoting potential, promoting the derepression of the \"Ink4a-Arf\" locus, and decreasing cellular transformation activities with c-Myc.",

It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a methylase domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in methylation state of DNA in that region will subsequently result. Transcription rates of genes so-affected will be reduced. Many of the effector domains function to modulate either the DNA directly - e.g. via methylation, cleaving, or recombination of the target DNA sequence - or by modulating its transcription rate - e.g. inhibiting transcription via repressor domains that block transcriptional machinery, promoting transcription with activation domains that recruit transcriptional machinery to the site, or histone- or other epigenetic-modification domains that affect chromatin state and the ability of transcriptional machinery to access the affected genes. Epigenetic modification is a major theme in determining varying expression levels for genes, as explained by the idea that how tightly-wound the DNA strand is - from histones at the local level up to chromatin at the chromosomal level - can influence the accessibility of sequences of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing the rate at which it can be transcribed. If, instead of impacting the DNA strand directly, as described above, a designer zinc-finger protein instead affects epigenetic modification state for a target DNA region, modulation of gene expression could similarly be accomplished. In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression in vivo, Choo \"et al\" designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. This specific oncogene is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The oncogene typically enables leukemia cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of cancer. By including a nuclear localization signal with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo \"et al\" were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo.

An expanding tumour requires new blood vessels to deliver adequate oxygen to the cancer cells, and thus exploits these normal physiological processes for its benefit. To do this, the cancer cells acquire the ability to orchestrate production of new vasculature by activating the 'angiogenic switch'. In doing so, they control non-cancerous cells that are present in the tumor that can form blood vessels by reducing the production of factors that inhibit blood vessel production, and increasing the production of factors that promote blood vessel formation.",

More than 30 mutations in the SDHC gene have been found to increase the risk of hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma type 3. People with this condition have paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, or both. An inherited SDHC gene mutation predisposes an individual to the condition, and a somatic mutation that deletes the normal copy of the SDHC gene is needed to cause hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma type 3. Most of the inherited SDHC gene mutations change single amino acids in the SDHC protein sequence or result in a shortened protein. As a result, there is little or no SDH enzyme activity. Because the mutated SDH enzyme cannot convert succinate to fumarate, succinate accumulates in the cell. The excess succinate abnormally stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which also builds up in cells. Excess HIF stimulates cells to divide and triggers the production of blood vessels when they are not needed. Rapid and uncontrolled cell division, along with the formation of new blood vessels, can lead to the development of tumors in people with hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma.",

The goal of Libutti's research program is to develop novel cancer therapies through a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment. The interaction of a tumor and its vasculature is critical for both tumor growth and the spread of tumor cells to distant organs. The process of new vessel development within the tumor is termed angiogenesis and is required for tumors to grow larger than a few millimeters. In order to better understand the relationship between the tumor and its blood supply, their research is focused on the interaction between tumor-derived factors and endothelial cells developing in the context of the tumor microenvironment. By understanding this interaction they hope to be able to design novel treatment strategies to inhibit both the growth and the spread of tumors. They are currently studying a variety of tumor-derived factors with effects on tumor-associated vasculature. These include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial cell monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II). EMAP-II is a cytokine with potent effects on blood vessels and was discovered by a research team (including Libutti) at Columbia University. Cytokines such as VEGF and EMAP-II appear to be produced in varying amounts by tumors and have direct effects on the tumor neovasculature. Libutti's approach to the study of these interactions has been through the utilization of a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems. His team is using gene expression profiling to understand the changes that occur in endothelial cells exposed to tumor-derived factors. His laboratory is developing techniques, which allow them to isolate endothelial cells from tumor tissue. This has resulted in their ability to study tumor-derived endothelial cells directly, and has led to the observation that tumor associated endothelial cells have epigenetic changes compared to normal endothelial cells from the same tissue type. This approach has also allowed them to identify specific genes such as FILIP1L (formerly DOC1), which appear to play a role in the control of endothelial cell responses to angiogenesis inhibitors. They are also using noninvasive imaging techniques, including dynamic MRI and PET, to map changes in tumor blood flow within tumors both in animal models and in patients on clinical trials. A variety of inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis are being actively studied. These include both recombinant proteins derived from naturally occurring substances as well as small molecules designed to act on specific pathways. Various methods of delivering these agents, including gene therapy approaches and the use of tumor targeted nanoparticles are being pursued. Libutti was the first to administer TNF bound colloidal gold nanoparticles as targeted therapy to cancer patients. The overall goal of Libutti's work is to translate a better understanding of tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions, within the context of the tumor microenvironment, into better therapies for patients with cancer. Dr. Libutti is also studying the role of tumor suppressor genes such as \"MEN1\" in the process of tumor formation. Specifically, deciphering the role of \"MEN1\" in the tissue selective development of tumors is work for which Libutti received an R01 grant from the NCI . Libutti has published over 270 peer reviewed journal articles and currently has a Hirsch Index of 60.

In fact it may be present in a higher concentration in the amniotic fluid than it is in the mother's bloodstream. The skin of the fetus is able to absorb the chemical directly from the amniotic fluid until the 24th week of pregnancy. Cocaine can also show up in breast milk and affect the nursing baby. The severity of effects depends on how much of the drug is used, how often, and the stage in the development of the fetus. Cocaine prevents the reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Thus they stay in the synapse longer, causing excitement of the sympathetic nervous system and evoking a stress response. The euphoria experienced by cocaine users is thought to be largely due to the way it prevents the neurotransmitter serotonin from being reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron which released it. Use of cocaine during pregnancy can negatively affect both the mother and the fetus, but the ways in which it affects the fetus are poorly understood. There are three main mechanisms by which cocaine exposure harms a fetus: by altering brain chemistry, by altering the expression of certain genes, and by the constriction of blood vessels. The neurotransmitters affected by cocaine are involved in the development of the fetus's brain, so the drug may affect fetal development directly by altering the development of the brain's monoaminergic system. The most important way cocaine affects fetal development is by binding to dopamine receptors. Another possible mechanism by which cocaine harms the fetus may be in part by interfering with blood supply to the uterus. Cocaine causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in both mother and fetus, which can cause hypoxia in the fetus. Constricting blood vessels causes tissues to receive insufficient blood flow, killing cells, but this effect is less pronounced with cocaine than with nicotine. The reduction in blood flow to the uterus limits the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Cocaine also constricts the blood vessels in the fetus, which is potentially linked to slowed fetal growth and abnormal development of the genitourinary, cardiovascular, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems.",

Once the heart begins to beat, mechanical forces start acting upon the early vascular system, which rapidly expands and reorganizes to serve tissue metabolism. In embryos devoid of blood flow, endothelial cells retain an undifferentiated morphology similar to angioblasts (compared to flattened epithelial cells found in mature vasculature). Once the heart begins beating, the morphology and behaviour of endothelial cells change. By changing the heart rate, the heart can also control perfusion or pressure acting upon the system in order to trigger sprouting of new vessels. In turn, new vessel sprouting is balanced by the expansion of other embryo tissues, which compress blood vessels as they grow. The equilibrium of these forces plays a major role in vascular remodelling, but although the angiogenic mechanisms required to trigger the sprouting of new vessels have been studied, little is known about the remodelling processes required to curb the growth of unnecessary branches. As blood perfuses the system, it exerts shear and pressure forces on the vessel walls. At the same time, tissue growth outside the cardiovascular system pushes back on the outside of the vessel walls. These forces must be balanced to obtain an efficient energy state for low-cost delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the embryo body. When growth of the yolk sac (external tissue) is constrained, the balance between vascular forces and tissue forces is shifted and some vascular branches may be disconnected or diminished during the remodelling process because they are unable to forge new paths through the compressed tissue. In general, the stiffness and resistance of these tissues dictates the degree to which they can be deformed and the way in which biomechanical forces can affect them.",

Circadian oscillators may be regulated by phosphorylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and histone acetylation and deacetylation, the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily.
