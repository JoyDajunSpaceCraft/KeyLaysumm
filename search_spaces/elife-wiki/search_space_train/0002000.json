Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the intestinal microbiota and for metabolic development.

One study has reported that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 \u03bcg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, compared to control mice. In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting insulin levels in mice. However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being overweight in those given macrolides compared to penicillin and cephalosporin. Therefore, there is correlation between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether or not there is a causal relationship remains unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy.",

From around 2005 on, the scientific community has thoroughly developed the concept of human microbiome and begun the systematic study to establish the relationship between the microbiome and human physiology in health and disease. We begin to understand that gut microbiota helps modulating host immunity at a systemic level. However, gut microbiome does not affect skin immunity significantly, instead, skin immunity is modulated by skin microflora according to the results obtained by Naik et al. Analyzing immunologic changes of germ-free (GF) mice with reconstituted gut microbiota showed a recovery of Il-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels up to those observed in the gastrointestinal tract of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice but gut microbiome restoration did not affect skin immunity. Comparing GF and SPF mice showed a decrease in the skin production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A. To evaluate the functional consequences of the absence of skin microbiota Leishmania major was introduced intradermally and the lesions were evaluated. L. major lesions in GF mice were significantly smaller and less severe than in SPF mice, however, the number of parasites after infection was significantly higher in GF mice. These results cearly indicate that GF mice have an impaired capacity of response in front of infections compared to SPF mice. Finally, mono-association of GF mice with \"S. epidermidis\" clearly restored immunity function which in the case of skin is mediated by IL-1 which is key for the restoration of IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Thus skin commensals exert their effect by enhancing IL-1 signaling and amplifying responses according to local inflammatory milieu. As IL-1 has been implicated in the etiology and pathology of psoriasis and other cutaneous disorders, it is likely that skin commensals are important drivers and amplifiers of skin pathologies.",

In the gut of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" the composition and action of the microbiome appears to be tightly regulated within compartments, that is different sections of the intestines. This is indicated by the differential expression of genes, especially with a regulatory function, in the epithelium of different parts of the gut. In detail, the gut is compartmentalized into three parts, the foregut, the midgut, and the hindgut. While foregut and hindgut are lined with a cuticle formed by the ectodermal epithelium, the midgut is of entodermal origin. In adult flies the midgut is further divided into five smaller regions. The immune response varies among the gut regions. The immune deficiency (IMD) pathway responds to bacterial infections and is activated by certain receptors (e.g., the peptidoglycan receptor protein PGRP-LC). These receptors and also other components of the \"Drosophila\" immune system such as Toll receptor and dDUOX pathway molecules control immune responses in ectodermal tissue of the anterior gut. Moreover, the anterior midgut is enriched in certain antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). This suggests that the immune defence in this area is particularly responsive, possibly because this regions represents the first contact region for newly taken up food, microbiota, and/or intestinal pathogens. In the middle and posterior midgut, other genes such as the receptor PGRP-LB, which down-regulates the IMD immune response, are expressed, possibly in order to minimize expression of immune defence against the microbiota. In addition, the microbiota itself seems to control the expression of several \"Drosophila\" metabolic genes within the midgut, possibly to facilitate digestion of food. Taken together, it appears that the interaction between host and microbiota is precisely regulated across different regions within the gut.",

Gut flora can also regulate the production of antibodies by the immune system. One function of this regulation is to cause B cells to class switch to IgA. In most cases B cells need activation from T helper cells to induce class switching; however, in another pathway, gut flora cause NF-kB signaling by intestinal epithelial cells which results in further signaling molecules being secreted. These signaling molecules interact with B cells to induce class switching to IgA. IgA is an important type of antibody that is used in mucosal environments like the gut. It has been shown that IgA can help diversify the gut community and helps in getting rid of bacteria that cause inflammatory responses. Ultimately, IgA maintains a healthy environment between the host and gut bacteria. These cytokines and antibodies can have effects outside the gut, in the lungs and other tissues.",

They participate in effective antimicrobial defence through the production of IL-17 and IL-22. The role of IL-22 in humans and mice is somewhat different. In the murine model, IL-22 was found to play a role in improving the course of inflammatory bowel disease and epithelial restoration in the loss of the protective mucin barrier in the large intestine. However, in humans with inflammatory bowel disease, IL-22 has an effect on the pathology of the disease. IL-22 is an important cytokine for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The action of IL-22 helps enhance the defense of the surface of the intestinal mucosa by weakening the mucin layer and its ability to produce antimicrobial agents, such as \u03b2-defensins, is a powerful mechanism that helps maintain intestinal homeostasis.An increase in IL-22 levels together with increased \u03b2-defensin expression has been reported in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. IL-22, as well as IL-17, could thus be involved in the development of these skin diseases, since in humans without these problems IL-22 expression was not registered. The effects of IL-17 and IL-22 can complement each other and stimulate an increased amount of antimicrobial peptides at the site of action . Like ILC2, ILC 3 can express MHC II and be appropriating the function of antigen presenting cells. However, ILCs lack the costimulatory receptors that are necessary for proper activation and initiation of the immune response. ILCs, on the contrary, may set the helper T lymphocytes in the state of anergy. In the case of ILC 3, the ability to express MHC II apparently serves to maintain tolerance to commensal bacteria in the intestine. They suppress the response of CD4 + T lymphocytes to harmless and beneficial intestinal bacteria. If this tolerance is not maintained, there can be a development of undesirable pathological conditions . On the other hand, the action of IL-23 or IL-17 is not always beneficial. It causes some autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. IL-17A specifically targets keratinocytes and is the major cytokine causing pathogenesis of skin psoriasis. In addition, IL-17A is also expressed to an increasing extent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ILC 3 may play a role already in the prenatal setting of the body's resistance to infections.

HMOs selectively facilitate growth of particular beneficial bacteria, notably \"Bifidobacterium\" species. Furthermore, as bifidobacterial genomes are uniquely equipped to metabolize HMOs, which are otherwise indigestible by enzymes of the infant gut, some have suggested a coevolutionary dynamic between HMOs and certain bacteria common in both the milk and infant gastrointestinal microbiomes. Furthermore, relative to other mammalian milks, primate milk, particularly human milk, appears to be unique with respect to the complexity and diversity of its oligosaccharide repertoire. Human milk is typified by greater overall HMO diversity and predominance of oligosaccharides known to promote growth of \"Bifidobacterium\" in the infant gut. Milk microbiota are thought to play an essential role in programming the infant immune system, and tend to reduce the risk of adverse infant health outcomes. Differences in milk oligosaccharides between humans and non-human primates could be indicative of variation in pathogen exposure associated with increased sociality and group sizes. Together, these observations may indicate that milk microbial communities have coevolved with their human host, supported by the expectation that microbes which promote host health facilitate their own transmission and proliferation.",

The hygiene hypothesis, a concept initially theorized by immunologists and epidemiologists, has been proved to have a strong connection with evolutionary mismatch through recent year studies. Hygiene hypothesis states that the profound increase in allergies, autoimmune diseases, and some other chronic inflammatory diseases is related to the reduced exposure of the immune system to antigens. Such reduced exposure is more common in industrialized countries and especially urban areas, where the inflammatory chronic diseases are also more frequently seen. Recent analysis and studies have tied the hygiene hypothesis and evolutionary mismatch together. Some researchers suggest that the overly sterilized urban environment changes or depletes the microbiota composition and diversity. Such environmental conditions favor the development of the inflammatory chronic diseases because human bodies have been selected to adapt to a pathogen-rich environment in the history of evolution. For example, studies have shown that change in our symbiont community can lead to the disorder of immune homeostasis, which can be used to explain why antibiotic use in early childhood can result in higher asthma risk. Because the change or depletion of the microbiome is often associated with hygiene hypothesis, the hypothesis is sometimes also called \"biome depletion theory\".",

His conception and co-development of Cre-Lox conditional mutagenesis continues to provide major discoveries of the mechanistic underpinnings of health and disease among hundreds of researchers and their laboratories. Prior to the development of conditional mutagenesis, the use of homologous recombination was limited to systemic gene targeting and mutation. Marth's use of Cre-Lox conditional mutagenesis established the presence and functions of multiple and in some cases previously unknown enzymes participating in protein glycosylation, an area of research that has become a focus of exploration in how common diseases originate in the absence of discernible pathogenic genetic variation. Marth has further used Cre-Lox conditional mutagenesis to establish a reproducible method for obtaining animal models of essential X chromosome-linked genes. These studies further explained how glycan linkages function in the origins of disease at the metabolic and cellular levels. Marth's early studies of glycosylation and glycan linkages revealed a profound effect on immunity and contributed substantially to the genesis of the related field of glycoimmunology. Marth's lab further discovered relationships between aberrant glycan linkages and autoimmune diseases including the fact that alterations of glycan linkages could initiate chronic inflammation in the development of autoimmunity. Marth's research has shown that the occurrence of autoimmune conditions (such as lupus) in mammals can be caused by the presence of abnormal glycan structures within the body. Marth's laboratory has also taken a close look at the molecular and cellular bases of type 2 diabetes and the role that protein glycosylation has in the origin of the disease. Their research showed that the malfunction of pancreatic beta cells was the major contributor to disease onset. Their research indicated that genetic variation was unlikely to be the cause of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes in humans. Instead, their models suggested that metabolic alterations of pancreatic beta cells due to an elevation of fatty acids in obesity disabled glucose sensing, resulting in hyperglycemia with glucose intolerance. Marth\u2019s laboratory further found that this pathway was induced in human patients with type 2 diabetes and was responsible for a significant amount of insulin resistance present in obesity-associated diabetes. The pathological features of sepsis have also been the subject of research by Marth's laboratory. Marth and colleagues discovered the first physiological purpose of the Ashwell-Morell Receptor (AMR), a hepatocyte lectin discovered by Gilbert Ashwell and Anatol Morell. Their studies revealed both a biological purpose of the receptor and how to use it for therapeutic purposes in pneumococcal sepsis. In 2008, Dr. Marth published an enumeration of the building blocks of life, all of which fall under the 4 types of macromolecules present in all cells (glycans, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins). This concept is becoming a feature of modern cell biology texts. Marth and other colleagues have called attention to the fact that only half of these macromolecules are encoded in the genome, thus indicating that a more holistic and rigorous approach is needed to understanding cell biology and the origins of disease. In his position as the Director of the Center of Nanomedicine, Marth and his team are exploring the application of new delivery methods to directly visualize and treat disease in collaboration with Center for Nanomedicine Co-Founder, Dr. Erkki Ruoslahti.",

However, gut microbiome does not affect skin immunity significantly, instead, skin immunity is modulated by skin microflora according to the results obtained by Naik et al. Analyzing immunologic changes of germ-free (GF) mice with reconstituted gut microbiota showed a recovery of Il-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels up to those observed in the gastrointestinal tract of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice but gut microbiome restoration did not affect skin immunity. Comparing GF and SPF mice showed a decrease in the skin production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A. To evaluate the functional consequences of the absence of skin microbiota Leishmania major was introduced intradermally and the lesions were evaluated. L. major lesions in GF mice were significantly smaller and less severe than in SPF mice, however, the number of parasites after infection was significantly higher in GF mice. These results cearly indicate that GF mice have an impaired capacity of response in front of infections compared to SPF mice. Finally, mono-association of GF mice with \"S. epidermidis\" clearly restored immunity function which in the case of skin is mediated by IL-1 which is key for the restoration of IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Thus skin commensals exert their effect by enhancing IL-1 signaling and amplifying responses according to local inflammatory milieu. As IL-1 has been implicated in the etiology and pathology of psoriasis and other cutaneous disorders, it is likely that skin commensals are important drivers and amplifiers of skin pathologies.",

Because ticks feed repeatedly and only on blood, and have long lives, they are suitable hosts for many types of microbes.

If the microbes cause pathological changes, they are known as pathogens.

However, some microbes, such as \"Anaplasma marginale\" and \"A. centrale\", can also be transmitted by biting flies, or by blood on injection needles (iatrogenic transmission). A characteristic of diseases caused by tick-transmitted microbes is that herds or flocks of livestock often acquire effective levels of immune resistance to both the vector ticks and the microbes, so outbreaks of acute disease tend to be rare. This stability is often due to immunity to the microbes developing as a result of survival through early infection from ticks carring small infective doses of the microbe, the epidemiology of infections with \"Babesia\" species of protozoa is a well described example. The ticks are often constantly present and long-lived. Acquisition of immunity may be aided by the protection of antibodies in the mother\u2019s colostrum (first milk).",

She belongs to the Center for International Security and Cooperation at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University. She is particularly concerned about the potential impact of emerging infectious diseases. There are a number of issues that make infectious diseases a particularly significant concern. One issue is the development of antibiotic-resistant microbes, which have been emerging as a result of over-use of antibiotics since the 1950s. Shapiro is involved in development of drugs that will attack both a particular bacteria and its mechanisms of drug resistance, to prevent drug-resistant strains from developing. Another concern is the introduction of bacteria into previously unexposed populations, due to increased travel, population expansion into previously unexplored areas, and climate change. This includes the development of zo\u00f6notic diseases which travel from one species to another, such as influenza. To address either naturally occurring or intentionally developed biological threats, it is essential to understand the mechanisms involved internally in cells and in populations of cells in their environments. Shapiro emphasizes the importance of understanding the complexity of living systems, and the need to be aware that interventions may have unexpected consequences.",

In a sense, microbes train developing immune system to identify actual threats from harmless allergens, but there is not yet full consensus of the mechanism. During biological evolution, we have in a way outsourced many of the functions of our body to our microbiota. Microbiota trains immune system throughout the life: organs constantly process invacive particles and proteins. Functional immune system discriminates threatening particles from the harmless ones and products of one's own cells from foreign ones.

            "document": "Antimicrobial resistance . Resistance arises through one of three mechanisms: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic mutation, or by one species acquiring resistance from another. All classes of microbes can develop resistance. Fungi develop antifungal resistance. Viruses develop antiviral resistance. Protozoa develop antiprotozoal resistance, and bacteria develop antibiotic resistance. Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations. However, extended use of antimicrobials appears to encourage mutations which can render antimicrobials ineffective. Preventive measures include only using antibiotics when needed, thereby stopping misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are preferred over broad-spectrum antibiotics when possible, as effectively and accurately targeting specific organisms is less likely to cause resistance. For people who take these medications at home, education about proper use is essential. Health care providers can minimize spread of resistant infections by use of proper sanitation and hygiene, including handwashing and disinfecting between patients, and should encourage the same of the patient, visitors, and family members. Rising drug resistance is caused mainly by use of antimicrobials in humans and other animals, and spread of resistant strains between the two. Growing resistance has also been linked to dumping of inadequately treated effluents from the pharmaceutical industry, especially in countries where bulk drugs are manufactured. Antibiotics increase selective pressure in bacterial populations, causing vulnerable bacteria to die; this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing. Even at very low levels of antibiotic, resistant bacteria can have a growth advantage and grow faster than vulnerable bacteria. With resistance to antibiotics becoming more common there is greater need for alternative treatments. Calls for new antibiotic therapies have been issued, but new drug development is becoming rarer.",

Signs and symptoms include white patches on the tongue or other areas of the mouth and throat. Other symptoms may include soreness and problems swallowing. When it affects the vagina, it is commonly called a yeast infection. Signs and symptoms include genital itching, burning, and sometimes a white \"cottage cheese-like\" discharge from the vagina. Yeast infections of the penis are less common and typically present with an itchy rash. Very rarely, yeast infections may become invasive, spreading to other parts of the body. This may result in fevers along with other symptoms depending on the parts involved. More than 20 types of \"Candida\" can cause infection with \"Candida albicans\" being the most common. Infections of the mouth are most common among children less than one month old, the elderly, and those with weak immune systems. Conditions that result in a weak immune system include HIV/AIDS, the medications used after organ transplantation, diabetes, and the use of corticosteroids. Other risks include dentures and following antibiotic therapy. Vaginal infections occur more commonly during pregnancy, in those with weak immune systems, and following antibiotic use. Individuals at risk for invasive candidiasis include low birth weight babies, people recovering from surgery, people admitted to an intensive care units, and those with an otherwise compromised immune systems. Efforts to prevent infections of the mouth include the use of chlorhexidine mouth wash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively. Infections of the mouth occur in about 6% of babies less than a month old. About 20% of those receiving chemotherapy for cancer and 20% of those with AIDS also develop the disease. About three-quarters of women have at least one yeast infection at some time during their lives. Widespread disease is rare except in those who have risk factors.",

The hygiene hypothesis, a concept initially theorized by immunologists and epidemiologists, has been proved to have a strong connection with evolutionary mismatch through recent year studies. Hygiene hypothesis states that the profound increase in allergies, autoimmune diseases, and some other chronic inflammatory diseases is related to the reduced exposure of the immune system to antigens. Such reduced exposure is more common in industrialized countries and especially urban areas, where the inflammatory chronic diseases are also more frequently seen. Recent analysis and studies have tied the hygiene hypothesis and evolutionary mismatch together. Some researchers suggest that the overly sterilized urban environment changes or depletes the microbiota composition and diversity. Such environmental conditions favor the development of the inflammatory chronic diseases because human bodies have been selected to adapt to a pathogen-rich environment in the history of evolution. For example, studies have shown that change in our symbiont community can lead to the disorder of immune homeostasis, which can be used to explain why antibiotic use in early childhood can result in higher asthma risk. Because the change or depletion of the microbiome is often associated with hygiene hypothesis, the hypothesis is sometimes also called \"biome depletion theory\".",
