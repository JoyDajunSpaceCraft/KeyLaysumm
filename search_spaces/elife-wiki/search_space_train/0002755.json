The relationship is symbiotic because the plant supplies the energy by photosynthesis and benefits by obtaining the fixed nitrogen. The reaction may be written symbolically as where P stands for inorganic phosphate. The precise structure of the active site has been difficult to determine. It appears to contain a MoFeS cluster that is able to bind the dinitrogen molecule and, presumably, enable the reduction process to begin. The electrons are transported by the associated \"P\" cluster, which contains two cubical FeS clusters joined by sulfur bridges.",

Molybdenum (Mo) is the most abundant transition element in solution in the sea (mostly as dianionic molybdate ion) and in living organisms, its abundance in the Earth\u2019s crust is quite low. Therefore, the use of Mo by living organisms seems surprising at first glance. Archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, including humans, require molybdenum. It is also found in over 50 different enzymes. Its hydrolysis to water-soluble oxo-anionic species makes Mo readily accessible. Mo is found in the active sites of metalloenzymes that perform key transformations in the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, arsenic, selenium, sulfur, and chlorine compounds. The mononuclear Mo enzymes are widely distributed in the biosphere; they catalyze many significant reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds as well as various carbonyl compounds (e.g., aldehydes, CO, and CO). Nitrate reductases enzymes are important for the nitrogen cycle. They belong to a class of enzymes with a mononuclear Mo center and they catalyze the metabolism reaction of C, N, S, etc., in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans. Due to the oxidation of sulfides, The first considerable development was that of aerobic bacteria which could now utilize Mo. As oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere and oceans, the reaction of MoS to MoO also increased. This reaction made the highly soluble molybdate ion available for incorporation into critical metalloenzymes, and may have thus allowed life to thrive. It allowed organisms to occupy new ecological niches. Mo plays an important role in the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia, which occurs in one type of nitrogenases. These enzymes are used by bacteria that usually live in a symbiotic relationship with plants; their role is nitrogen fixation, which is vital for sustaining life on earth.

            "document": "Homoaromaticity . It was long considered that the best examples of neutral homoaromatics are bishomoaromatics such as barrelene and semibullvalene. First synthesized in 1966, semibullvalene has a structure that should lend itself well to homoaromaticity although there has been much debate whether semibullvalene derivatives can provide a true delocalized, ground state neutral homoaromatic compound or not. In an effort to further stabilize the delocalized transition structure by substituting semibullvalene with electron donating and accepting groups, it has been found that the activation barrier to this rearrangement can be lowered, but not eliminated. However, with the introduction of ring strain into the molecule, aimed at destabilizing the localized ground state structure's through the strategic addition of cyclic annulations, a delocalized homoaromatic ground-state structure can indeed be achieved. Of the neutral homoaromatics, the compounds best believed to exhibit neutral homoaromaticity are boron containing compounds of 1,2-diboretane and its derivatives. Substituted diboretanes are shown to have a much greater stabilization in the delocalized state over the localized one, giving strong indications of homoaromaticity. When electron-donating groups are attached to the two boron atoms, the compound favors a classical model with localized bonds. Homoaromatic character is best seen when electron-withdrawing groups are bonded to the boron atoms, causing the compound to adopt a nonclassical, delocalized structure. As the name suggests, trishomoaromatics are defined as containing one additional methylene bridge compared to bishomoaromatics, therefore containing three of these homoconjugate bridges in total. Just like semibullvalene, there is still much debate as to the extent of the homoaromatic character of trishomoaromatics. While theoretically they are homoaromatic, these compounds show a stabilization of no more than 5% of benzene due to delocalization. Unlike neutral homoaromatic compounds, anionic homoaromatics are widely accepted to exhibit \"true\" homoaromaticity. These anionic compounds are often prepared from their neutral parent compounds through lithium metal reduction. 1,2-diboretanide derivatives show strong homoaromatic character through their three-atom (boron, boron, carbon), two-electron bond, which contains shorter C-B bonds than in the neutral classical analogue. These 1,2-diboretanides can be expanded to larger ring sizes with different substituents and all contain some degree of homoaromaticity. Anionic homoaromaticity can also be seen in dianionic bis-diazene compounds, which contain a four-atom (four nitrogens), six-electron center. Experiment results have shown the shortening of the transannular nitrogen-nitrogen distance, therefore demonstrating that dianionic bis-diazene is a type of anionic bishomoaromatic compound. Peculiar feature of these systems is that the cyclic electron delocalization is taking place in the \u03c3-plane defined by the four nitrogens. These bis-diazene-dianions are therefore the first examples for 4-center-6-electron \u03c3-bishomoaromaticity. The corresponding 2 electron \u03c3-bishomoaromatic systems were realized in the form of pagodane dications (see above). There are also reports of antihomoaromatic compounds. Just as aromatic compounds exhibit exceptional stability, antiaromatic compounds, which deviate from Huckel's rule and contain a closed loop of 4n \u03c0 electrons, are relatively unstable. The bridged bicyclo[3.2.1]octa-3,6-dien-2-yl cation contains only 4 \u03c0 electrons, and is therefore \"bishomoantiaromatic.\" A series of theoretical calculations confirm that it is indeed less stable than the corresponding allyl cation. Similarly, a substituted bicyclo[3.2.1]octa-3,6-dien-2-yl cation (the 2-(4'-Fluorophenyl) bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3,6-dien-2-yl cation) was also shown to be an antiaromate when compared to its corresponding allyl cation, corroborated by theoretical calculations as well as by NMR analysis.",

To date, a number of QFR enzymes have been crystalized and the specifics of enzyme structure varies between organisms; however, the overall structure remains similar across different species. Fumarate reductase complexes include four subunits. Subunit A contains the site of fumarate reduction and a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group. It is closely bound to subunit B, which contains three iron-sulfur centers, all placed near to each other and the nearby substrates. Subunit C consists of hydrophobic membrane-spanning, primarily helical segments and is the site of quinol oxidization. In some fumarate reductase structures, one or more heme groups are additionally bound to the C subunit and participate in the electron transfer. The D subunit contains hydrophobic alpha helices that span the membrane, but does not participate in the catalytic action of the enzyme. It may be required to anchor the catalytic components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic membrane. The reduction of fumarate in fumarate reductase is achieved via the oxidation of a quinol bound to subunit C and the resulting transfer of electrons down a chain of iron-sulfur clusters onto a waiting FAD molecule. The edge-to-edge distances between the quinol, the iron sulfur clusters, and the FAD in this enzyme do not exceed 12.5 Angstroms and can be seen on the image below. These short distances between electron receptors allow electrons to travel down the chain at a physiologically reasonable timescale. Once electrons have travelled down the iron-sulfur clusters, they pass onto the FAD molecule bound to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The final reduction of the fumarate is achieved in the active site where the asymmetrical charges from the nearby amino acids polarize the fumarate and distort its shape. Once the fumarate is no longer planar, a hydride from the bound FAD molecule in the active site attacks the double bond to reduce the fumarate. Thus, in this reaction, the fumarate serves as the terminal electron acceptor.  Succinate dehydrogenase (SQR) is a key enzyme in both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain in the mitochondria of eukaryotes and single celled organisms. It is a key enzyme in aerobic respiration and it performs the opposite reaction of QFR, by coupling the reduction of a quinone to the formation of succinate for use in the citric acid cycle.",

Speight reports a simplified representation of the separation of petroleum into the following six major fractions: volatile saturates, volatile aromatics, nonvolatile saturates, nonvolatile aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. He also reports arbitrarily defined physical boundaries for petroleum using carbon-number and boiling point. The molecular structures proposed for the asphaltene (heavy organic) molecules includes carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur as well as polar and non-polar groups.  The molecular structure of asphaltenes is difficult to determine because the molecules tend to stick together in solution. These materials are extremely complex mixtures containing hundreds or even thousands of individual chemical species. Asphaltenes do not have a specific chemical formula: individual molecules can vary in the number of atoms contained in the structure, and the average chemical formula can depend on the source. Although they have been subjected to modern analytical methods, including the well known SARA analysis, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance, the exact molecular structures are difficult to determine. Given this limitation, asphaltenes are composed mainly of polyaromatic carbon ring units with oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur heteroatoms, combined with trace amounts of heavy metals, particularly chelated vanadium and nickel, and aliphatic side chains of various lengths. Many asphaltenes from crude oils around the world contain similar ring units, which are linked together to make highly diverse large molecules.",

Major achievements have been the development of rational synthetic routes, the preparation of molecular systems with unusual structures and properties and the development of main group compounds as reagents for organic chemistry. His work on sulfur-nitrogen rings and cages, as well as selenium and tellurium chemistry, has led to development of new molecular devices including precursors to new single source II-VI semiconductors.

So far the extractants such as dithioimidodiphosphinates have not been used widely in industrial processes. Derek's work on phosphorus-sulfur and phosphorus-selenium chemistry resulted in Woollins' reagent that has been manufactured on a commercial scale for use in organic synthesis.

Mo is found in the active sites of metalloenzymes that perform key transformations in the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, arsenic, selenium, sulfur, and chlorine compounds. The mononuclear Mo enzymes are widely distributed in the biosphere; they catalyze many significant reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds as well as various carbonyl compounds (e.g., aldehydes, CO, and CO). Nitrate reductases enzymes are important for the nitrogen cycle. They belong to a class of enzymes with a mononuclear Mo center and they catalyze the metabolism reaction of C, N, S, etc., in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans.

Each active site is specially designed in response to their substrates, as a result, most enzymes have specificity and can only react with particular substrates. This specificity is determined by the arrangement of amino acids within the active site and the structure of the substrates. Sometimes enzymes also need to bind with some cofactors to fulfil their function. The active site is usually a groove or pocket of the enzyme which can be located in a deep tunnel within the enzyme, or between the interfaces of multimeric enzymes. An active site can catalyse a reaction repeatedly as residues are not altered at the end of the reaction (they may change during the reaction, but are regenerated by the end). This process is achieved by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, so more substrates have enough energy to undergo reaction.",

Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses.

Each subunit tightly binds one molecule of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate tightly on each subunit. Both alpha-helices and beta-sheets are present in the protein motif, which is best described as a split-barrel structure. This structure is due, in part, to the disulfide bonds present in the secondary protein structure of this enzyme.

Before the reaction can begin, the PLP cofactor binds to the lysine side chain to form a Schiff base that promotes attack by glycine substrate. Lysine acts as a general base during this mechanism. In the detailed reaction mechanism, the hydronium atoms that are added in come from a variety of residues in that offer hydrogen bonds to facilitate ALA synthesis. ALA synthase removes the carboxyl group from glycine and the CoA from the succinyl-CoA by means of its prosthetic group pyridoxal phosphate (a vitamin b6 derivative), forming \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid (dALA), so called because the amino group is on the fourth carbon atom in the molecule. This reaction mechanism is particularly unique relative to other enzymes that use the PLP cofactor because Glycine is initially deprotonated by a highly conserved active site lysine, leading to condensation with succinyl-CoA and loss of CoA. Protonation of the carbonyl group of the intermediate by an active site histidine leads to loss of the carboxyl group. The last intermediate is finally reprotonated to produce ALA. Dissociation of ALA from the enzyme is the rate limiting step of the enzymatic reaction and was shown to be depended upon a slow conformational change of the enzyme. The function of pyridoxal phosphate is to facilitate the removal of hydrogen, by utilizing the electrophilic pyridinium ring as an electron sink.",

Monod writes that an enzymatic reaction can be seen in two steps: The formation of a sterospecific complex between protein and substrate and the catalytic activation of a reaction within the complex (he stresses again that the reaction is oriented and specified by the structure of the complex). He next considers the energetic differences between covalent and non-covalent bonds and how the speed of a reaction is affected by activation energy. Since the activation energy of a covalent bond is high, the reaction will have a slower speed than that of a non-covalent bond (which occurs spontaneously and rapidly). The author points out that non-covalent interactions attain stability only through numerous interactions and when applied over short distances. To attain stable non-covalent interaction there is a need for complementary sites between two interacting molecules so as to permit several atoms of the one to enter into contact with several atoms of the other. In this complex, the molecule of substrate is strictly positioned by the multiple non-covalent interactions with the enzyme. Enzymatic catalysis is believed to result from the inductive and polarizing action of certain chemical groupings of the specific receptor. By virtue of an enzyme's capacity to form sterospecific and non-covalent complexes with specific substrate, the substrate is correctly presented in the precise orientation that specifies the catalytic effect of the enzyme.

A fourth iron atom is included in the cluster together with a water molecule when the enzyme is activated. This fourth iron atom binds to either one, two, or three partners; in this reaction, oxygen atoms belonging to outside metabolites are always involved. When ACO2 is not bound to a substrate, the iron-sulfur cluser is bound to a hydroxyl group through an interaction with one of the iron molecules. When the substrate binds, the bound hydroxyl becomes protonated. A hydrogen bond forms between His101 and the protonated hydroxyl, which allows the hydroxyl to form a water molecule. Alternatively, the proton could be donated by His167 as this histidine is hydrogen bonded to a H2O molecule. His167 is also hydrogen bonded to the bound H2O in the cluster. Both His101 and His167 are paired with carboxylates Asp100 and Glu262, respectively, and are likely to be protonated. The conformational change associated with substrate binding reorients the cluster. The residue that removes a proton from citrate or isocitrate is Ser642.

The charges distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary, which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out. Otherwise, there will be a repulsive force to push them apart. The active site usually contains non-polar amino acids, although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur.

The active site of CYP2E1 is the smallest observed in human P450 enzymes, with its small capacity attributed in part to the introduction of an isoleucine at position 115. The side-chain of this residue protrudes out above the heme center, restricting active site volume compared to related enzymes that have less bulky residues at this position. T, which also protrudes into the active site, is particularly important for substrate positioning above the reactive iron center and is hence highly conserved by many cytochrome P450 enzymes.

In mammals, the cytoplasmic-nuclear synthetase (AceCS1) is activated by SIRT1 while the mitochondrial synthetase (AceCS2) is activated by SIRT3. This action increases activity of this enzyme. The exact location of the lysine residue varies between species, occurring at Lys-642 in humans, but is always present in the active site of the enzyme. Since there is an essential allosteric change that occurs with the binding of an AMP molecule, the presence of AMP can contribute to regulation of the enzyme. Concentration of AMP must be high enough so that it can bind in the allosteric binding site and allow the other substrates to enter the active site. Also, copper ions deactivate acetyl Co-A synthetase by occupying the proximal site of the A-cluster active site, which prevents the enzyme from accepting a methyl group to participate in the Wood-Ljungdahl Pathway. The presence of all the reactants in the proper concentration is also needed for proper functioning as in all enzymes.  Acetyl\u2014CoA synthetase is also produced when it is needed for fatty acid synthesis, but, under normal conditions, the gene is inactive and has certain transcriptional factors that activate transcription when necessary.
