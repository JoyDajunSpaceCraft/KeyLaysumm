Morphologically, the dentary makes up most the lower jaw, and it curves and extends down posteriorly to the area of the articular and jaw articulation. Correspondingly, in the upper jaw, the squamosal bone becomes situated next to the quadrate. The posterior end of this enlarged dentary fits into a small nook in the squamosal of the upper jaw, and displays the beginning of the evolution of the squamosal-dentary jaw joint. This squamosal-dentary jaw articulation is the same joint exhibited by mammals, and the inclusion of this joint in \"Probainognathus\" indicates that it is a precursor to mammals. Along with this osteological feature, the jaw of \"Probainognathus\" is suggested to have had mammal-like soft tissue advancements, as well. The jaw muscles in \"Probainognathus\" were thought to have been positioned farther forward, with the masseter splitting into two separate muscles: the superficial masseter and the deep masseter. Despite this new development, the reptilian quadrate-articular jaw joint persists in \"Probainognathus\", and a paired jaw joint is the result. Because of this, the jaw of \"Probainognathus\" remains distinct from that of mammals due mostly to the presence of the articular and the quadrate.  Once the dentary-squamosal articulation becomes more established, the former bones involved in jaw articulation, the articular and quadrate, can become integrated into the inner ear as the malleus and incus, respectively. This has not yet happened in the case of \"Probainognathus\", but the reduced size of the quadrate, as well as its loose association with the squamosal and proximity to the stapes indicates the quadrate to incus prosses is underway. This combination of evidence further solidifies \"Probainognathus\"\u2019 phylogenic placement on the line to Mammalia, and provides a sound evolutionary connection between reptiles and mammals.",

Mammals are unique in having evolved a three-ossicle middle-ear independently of the various single-ossicle middle ears of other land vertebrates, all during the Triassic period of geological history. Functionally, the mammalian middle ear is very similar to the single-ossicle ear of non-mammals, except that it responds to sounds of higher frequency, because these are better taken up by the inner ear (which also responds to higher frequencies than those of non-mammals). The malleus, or \"hammer\", evolved from the articular bone of the lower jaw, and the incus, or \"anvil\", from the quadrate. In other vertebrates, these bones form the primary jaw joint, but the expansion of the dentary bone in mammals led to the evolution of an entirely new jaw joint, freeing up the old joint to become part of the ear. For a period of time, both jaw joints existed together, one medially and one laterally. The evolutionary process leading to a three-ossicle middle ear was thus an \"accidental\" byproduct of the simultaneous evolution of the new, secondary jaw joint. In many mammals, the middle ear also becomes protected within a cavity, the auditory bulla, not found in other vertebrates. A bulla evolved late in time and independently numerous times in different mammalian clades, and it can be surrounded by membranes, cartilage or bone.

By analyzing hundreds of microscopic scratches on the teeth of a fossilized \"Edmontosaurus\" jaw, the team determined hadrosaurs had a unique way of eating unlike any creature living today. In contrast to a flexible lower jaw joint prevalent in today's mammals, hadrosaurs had a unique hinge between the upper jaws and the rest of its skull. The team found the dinosaur's upper jaws pushed outwards and sideways while chewing, as the lower jaw slid against the upper teeth. This chewing method is called pleurokinesis. During pleurokinesis, the maxilla bones slide laterally outward from the mouth. This is accomplished with a hinge made of the joints between the premaxilla and maxilla bones and the lacrimal and prefrontal bones. Pleurokinesis allows for the teeth to more precisely grind against one another, for better shearing of plant material, and reduces the stress that chewing puts on the skull. Analysis of the wear patterns of the teeth has provided further insight into how these animals may have fed. On the teeth, four different sets of wear patterns can be found that indicate the lower jaw would have moved directly up and down. Furthermore, the wear patterns were parallel, revealing that the rows of teeth were extremely well aligned in the jaw.",

            "document": "Edmontosaurus . Before the 1960s and 1970s, the prevailing interpretation of hadrosaurids like \"Edmontosaurus\" was that they were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds. Between the mid-1980s and the first decade of the 2000s, the prevailing interpretation of how hadrosaurids processed their food followed the model put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel. He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that resulted in backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like rasps, processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects in a completely different way. Work in the early 2000s has challenged the Weishampel model. A study published in 2008 by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like \"Edmontosaurus\" lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds. They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of scratches on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. Other movements could produce similar scratches though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques. Vincent Williams and colleagues (2009) published additional work on hadrosaurid tooth microwear. They found four classes of scratches on \"Edmontosaurus\" teeth. The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is consistent with the Weishampel model. This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food. Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws. The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws. The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.",

The malleus, or \"hammer\", evolved from the articular bone of the lower jaw, and the incus, or \"anvil\", from the quadrate. In other vertebrates, these bones form the primary jaw joint, but the expansion of the dentary bone in mammals led to the evolution of an entirely new jaw joint, freeing up the old joint to become part of the ear. For a period of time, both jaw joints existed together, one medially and one laterally. The evolutionary process leading to a three-ossicle middle ear was thus an \"accidental\" byproduct of the simultaneous evolution of the new, secondary jaw joint. In many mammals, the middle ear also becomes protected within a cavity, the auditory bulla, not found in other vertebrates.

Morphologically, the dentary makes up most the lower jaw, and it curves and extends down posteriorly to the area of the articular and jaw articulation. Correspondingly, in the upper jaw, the squamosal bone becomes situated next to the quadrate. The posterior end of this enlarged dentary fits into a small nook in the squamosal of the upper jaw, and displays the beginning of the evolution of the squamosal-dentary jaw joint. This squamosal-dentary jaw articulation is the same joint exhibited by mammals, and the inclusion of this joint in \"Probainognathus\" indicates that it is a precursor to mammals. Along with this osteological feature, the jaw of \"Probainognathus\" is suggested to have had mammal-like soft tissue advancements, as well. The jaw muscles in \"Probainognathus\" were thought to have been positioned farther forward, with the masseter splitting into two separate muscles: the superficial masseter and the deep masseter. Despite this new development, the reptilian quadrate-articular jaw joint persists in \"Probainognathus\", and a paired jaw joint is the result. Because of this, the jaw of \"Probainognathus\" remains distinct from that of mammals due mostly to the presence of the articular and the quadrate.  Once the dentary-squamosal articulation becomes more established, the former bones involved in jaw articulation, the articular and quadrate, can become integrated into the inner ear as the malleus and incus, respectively. This has not yet happened in the case of \"Probainognathus\", but the reduced size of the quadrate, as well as its loose association with the squamosal and proximity to the stapes indicates the quadrate to incus prosses is underway.

But their descendants the therapsids (including mammals' ancestors) probably did have tympanic membranes and these probably were in contact with the quadrate bones; and the stapes bones were still in contact with the quadrates but functioned as auditory ossicles rather than braincase supports; so the therapsids' quadrates had a dual function, as part of the jaw joint and as parts of the hearing system.",

But anomodonts were very different from modern herbivorous mammals, as their only teeth were a pair of fangs in the upper jaw and it is generally agreed that they had beaks like those of birds or ceratopsians. The theriodonts (\"beast teeth\") and their descendants had jaw joints in which the lower jaw's articular bone tightly gripped the skull's very small quadrate bone. This allowed a much wider gape, and one group, the carnivorous gorgonopsians (\"gorgon faces\"), took advantage of this to develop \"sabre teeth\". But the theriodont's jaw hinge had a longer term significance \u2014 the much reduced size of the quadrate bone was an important step in the development of the mammalian jaw joint and middle ear.",

In the lineage most closely related to mammals, the jaws of \"Hadrocodium\" (about 195M years ago in the very early Jurassic) suggest that it or a very close ancestor may have been the first to have a nearly fully mammalian middle ear: it lacks the trough at the rear of the lower jaw, over which the eardrum stretched in therapsids and earlier mammaliformes, and the absence of this trough which suggests that \"Hadrocodium\"\u2019s ear was part of the cranium, as it is in mammals, and hence that the former articular and quadrate had migrated to the middle ear and become the malleus and incus; but \"Hadrocodium\"\u2019s dentary has a \"bay\" at the rear which mammals lack, a hint that its dentary bone retained the same shape that it would have had if the articular and quadrate had remained part of the jaw joint.",

These are of particular interest because of their \"transitional\" state: \"Yanoconodon\" has fundamentally modern middle ear bones, but these are still attached to the jaw by an ossified Meckel's cartilage. This is a feature retained from earlier stem mammals, and illustrates the transition from a basal tetrapod jaw and ear, to a mammalian one in which the middle ear bones are fully separate from the jaw. Despite this feature \"Yanoconodon\" is a true mammal\".\" It is thought that the feature was retained during early embryo development, whereas it is lost in most other mammal groups.

Modern platypus young have three teeth in each of the maxillae (one premolar and two molars) and dentaries (three molars), which they lose before or just after leaving the breeding burrow; adults have heavily keratinised pads in their place. The first upper and third lower cheek teeth of platypus nestlings are small, each having one principal cusp, while the other teeth have two main cusps. The platypus jaw is constructed differently from that of other mammals, and the jaw-opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound in the middle ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other premammalian synapsids. However, the external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw. The platypus has extra bones in the shoulder girdle, including an interclavicle, which is not found in other mammals. As in many other aquatic and semiaquatic vertebrates, the bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to provide ballast. It has a reptilian gait, with the legs on the sides of the body, rather than underneath. When on land, it engages in knuckle-walking on its front feet, to protect the webbing between the toes.",

In early synapsids such as the pelycosaurs, the quadrate and articular had to function as the jaw joint, and this severely limited how far these bones could be modified to alter the frequency range of the ear. But once these bones were no longer involved in the jaw joint, variations which affected hearing would not also affect jaw joint function, and this allowed unconstrained evolution of the mammalian hearing apparatus. By the Jurassic, the typical mammalian ear had evolved, in which the angular had become the tympanic annula (a bony support for the tympanic membrane), while the articular and quadrate had become the malleus and incus, respectively, connected in series with the stapes. This series of three bones acts as an impedance matching system to improve sound transmission and allow enhanced hearing.",
