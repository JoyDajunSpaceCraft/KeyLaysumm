Original interpretations of the formation of the Haasgat cave system (speleogenesis) emphasised development along a typical low-topographic relief pattern, where progressive erosion and deepening of the valley into the surface dolomites drained the phreatic cave, allowing for internal collapse and expansion of the system. Simultaneously, Keyser and Martini also suggested that the elevation of the system (near 1500m) and erosional deroofing prior to mining might indicate that the fossil deposits at Haasgat might have formed as early as the terminal Pliocene. Subsequent biostratigraphic interpretations of the fauna processed from the \"ex situ \"dumpsites produced two different proposed age ranges. An evaluation of the extinct baboon (\"Papio\" \"angusticeps)\" sample, a species currently only known across African Pleistocene deposits in the Kromdraai A assemblage, were taken to suggest that the Haasgat fossils were roughly contemporaneous (~1.9-1.8 million years ago). In contrast, a description of the non-primate faunas from the \"ex situ \"dumpsite emphasised the largely modern ungulate sample and suggested a more recent depositional age of maximally 1.5 \u2013 0.5 million years ago. Adams' (2013) recent analysis of all the ex-situ fauna from the cave suggests an age later than the first occurrence of \"Equus\" in Africa at ~2.3 Ma and an age prior to ~1.8 Ma Herries et al. 2014 (SAJS) also undertook a palaeomagnetic analysis of the cave deposits, indicating that the main in situ fossil beds were older than the end of the Olduvai SubChron at 1.95 Ma and younger than the Gauss-Matuyama Boundary at 2.58 Ma.

Dating carried out by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig revealed that the Jebel Irhoud site and its \"Homo sapiens\" fossils were far older than first thought. Fresh excavations revealed the remains of at least five people and a number of stone tools. The finds included part of a skull, a jawbone, teeth and limb bones which had come from three adults, a juvenile, and a child aged about seven and a half years old. The bones looked similar facially to those of humans today, but had much larger lower jaws and elongated braincases. They have similar features to a skull dating to 260,000 years ago found at the other end of the continent, in Florisbad, South Africa, which has been attributed to \"Homo sapiens\" on the basis of the Jebel Irhoud finds. The tools were found alongside gazelle bones and lumps of charcoal, indicating the presence of fire and probably of cooking in the cave. The gazelle bones showed characteristic signs of butchery and cooking, such as cut marks, notches consistent with marrow extraction, and charring. Some of the tools had been burned due to fires being lit on top of them, presumably after they had been discarded. This enabled the researchers to use thermoluminescence dating to ascertain when the burning had happened, and by proxy the age of the fossil bones, which were found in the same deposit layer. The burnt tools were dated to around 315,000 years ago, indicating that the fossils are of about the same age. This conclusion was confirmed by recalculating the age of the Irhoud 3 mandible, which produced an age range compatible with that of the tools at roughly 280,000 to 350,000 years old. This would make the remains the earliest known examples of \"Homo sapiens\".",

U-Pb dating of the underlying flowstone indicates that the fossils are not older than 2.0 million years old. The occurrence of species of animal that became extinct ~1.5 million years ago indicate the deposit is not younger than 1.5 million years old. The sediments have a 'normal' magnetic polarity, and the only major period between 2.0 and 1.5 million years ago when this occurred was the Olduvai sub-Chron between 1.95 and 1.78 million years ago, and so in 2010 the fossil was suggested to be around 1.95 million years old based on the transitional nature of some of the sediments and the stratigraphy at the site. In 2011 a more accurate date of the fossils was established when a capping flowstone was too old to enable the normal polarity deposits to date to the Olduvai event. The deposits were instead correlated to a ~3000 year long period centred at around 1.977 million years ago and known as the Pre-Olduvai event.",

There are fluctuations in evidence which are reflections of periods when the owls used the cave. Fossil samples from mole rat humeri\u2019s were collected and tested. Jaws and foot bones are the most common bones used to identify species since they are long-lasting and easy to identify even when in pieces.

Paleoanthropological work has typically placed the divergence between 25 and 23\u00a0mya, but genetic-based estimates have placed it in the early Oligocene, approximately 33\u00a0mya. Despite the predictions from the genetic tests, little fossil evidence has been found for a last common ancestor between 30 and 23\u00a0mya, favoring a later split. Only isolated teeth of \"Kamoyapithecus\" hinted at the existence of potential basal hominoids in the late Oligocene (between 24 and 27.5\u00a0mya), while the oldest fossil Old World monkey, \"Victoriapithecus macinnesi\", dates to 19\u00a0mya. With the discovery of \"Saadanius\", Zalmout \"et al.\" suggested a later split than the genetic data, dating between 29\u201328 and 24\u00a0mya. However, Pozzi \"et al.\" later argued that although \"Saadanius\" is a significant discovery, because it is a stem catarrhine, it could not be used to date the divergence of the crown group. The presence of stem taxa in the fossil record does not indicate that crown groups have evolved, and stem taxa may survive for millions of years after the crown taxa appear. For this reason, the fossil record can only suggest a hard minimum boundary for divergence dates, which corresponds to the first appearance of a crown taxon. Furthermore, Pozzi \"et al.\" pointed out that the supplementary material published by Zalmout \"et al.\" demonstrated that Pliopithecoidea were more closely related to living catarrhines than \"Saadanius\".",

Though this view is still widely accepted, in the 1980s a group of Dutch paleontologists used Dubois's collection of more than 20,000 animal fossils to reassess the date of the layer in which Java Man was found. Using only fossils from Trinil, they called that new faunal assemblage the Trinil H. K. Fauna, in which H. K. stands for \"Haupt Knochenschicht\", or \"main fossil-bearing layer\". This assessment dates the fossils of Java Man to between 900,000 and 1,000,000 years old.

Other fossils attest to the even earlier presence of \"H. erectus\" in Java. Sangiran 2 (named after its discovery site) may be as old as 1.66 Ma (million years). The controversial Mojokerto child, which Carl C. Swisher and Garniss Curtis once dated to 1.81 \u00b1 0.04 Ma, has now been convincingly re-dated to a maximum age of 1.49 \u00b1 0.13 Ma, that is, 1.49 million years with a margin of error of plus or minus 130,000 years.",
