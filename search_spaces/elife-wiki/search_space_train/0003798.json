Free Ca levels in the cytoplasm increases in response to a pathogenic infection. Ca signatures of this nature usually activate the plant defense system by inducing defense-related genes and the hypersensitive cell death. CaMs, CMLs and CaM-binding proteins are some of the recently identified elements of the plant defense signaling pathways. Several CML genes in tobacco, bean and tomato are responsive to pathogens. CML43 is a CaM-related protein that, as isolated from APR134 gene in the disease-resistant leaves of \"Arabidopsis\" for gene expression analysis, is rapidly induced when the leaves are inoculated with \"Pseudomonas syringae.\" These genes are also found in tomatoes (\"Solanum lycopersicum).\" The CML43 from the APR134 also binds to Ca ions in vitro which shows that CML43 and APR134 are, hence, involved in the Ca-dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens. The CML9 expression in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is rapidly induced by phytopathogenic bacteria, flagellin and salicylic acid. Expression of soybean SCaM4 and SCaM5 in transgenic \"tobacco\" and \"Arabidopsis\" causes an activation of genes related to pathogen resistance and also results in enhanced resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogen infection. The same is not true for soybean SCaM1 and SCaM2 that are highly conserved CaM isoforms. The \"At\"BAG6 protein is a CaM-binding protein that binds to CaM only in the absence of Ca and not in the presence of it. \"At\"BAG6 is responsible for the hypersensitive response of programmed cell death in order to prevent the spread of pathogen infection or to restrict pathogen growth. Mutations in the CaM binding proteins can lead to severe effects on the defense response of the plants towards pathogen infections. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are functional protein channels in the plasma membrane that have overlapping CaM binding sites transport divalent cations such as Ca. However, the exact role of the positioning of the CNGCs in this pathway for plant defense is still unclear.",

They inject a number of effector proteins, including TAL effectors, into the plant via their type III secretion system. TAL effectors have several motifs normally associated with eukaryotes including multiple nuclear localization signals and an acidic activation domain. When injected into plants, these proteins can enter the nucleus of the plant cell, bind plant promoter sequences, and activate transcription of plant genes that aid in bacterial infection. Plants have developed a defense mechanism against type III effectors that includes R (resistance) genes triggered by these effectors. Some of these R genes appear to have evolved to contain TAL-effector binding sites similar to site in the intended target gene. This competition between pathogenic bacteria and the host plant has been hypothesized to account for the apparently malleable nature of the TAL effector DNA binding domain.",

The life cycle of \"V. longisporum\" is very similar to that of \"V. dahliae. V. longisporum\" is able to survive using overwintering structures that can survive in the soil, called microsclerotia. Microsclerotia are masses of hyphae that are produced in the dying part of the plant and are used to infect healthy plants. When a canola root is near the microsclerotia, the fungi will grow towards it. Root exudates cause the microsclerotia to germinate. Once the fungus has entered the root, it will produce hyphae to move through the plant. The fungi also use conidia to transport. Once the fungi reaches the xylem, it can quickly colonize the plant. This causes the plant to start slowly dying. This is due to fungal growth and plant defenses clogging the xylem, so the plant cannot take up nutrients in this area. Once there is enough dead plant tissue, the fungus will produce more microsclerotia. The process will then continue to repeat. This is the only known life cycle of \"V. longisporum.\" The pathogen is only known to cause asexual disease. The fungus is primarily spread via soil cultivation, harvesting, or any action that causes movement of the soil.\"Verticillium spp.\" do a spectacular job of being able to germinate, spread within the plant, and reproduce in most weather types. With this, water is usually necessary for the germination of the resting spore to first affect plants.

Pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins) which perform many different functions that help to prevent disease accumulate in some BABA treated plants, regardless of whether they are inoculated with a pathogen or not. If infected however, the level of PR proteins tends to increase further. PR proteins are not the only mechanism of preventing infection however, as soil drenches of BABA that do not induce PR protein production, still confer resistance. This may be due to differences between plant families, as the Solanaceae (potato, tomato, pepper) respond by producing PR proteins without any pathogen present, whereas crucifers (Arabidopsis, cauliflower) require a pathogen to induce PR proteins. In other pathosystems, phytoalexins (anti-microbial compounds) accumulate to higher levels in BABA treated plants when they are infected by pathogens, but not when the pathogen is not present. Foliar sprays of BABA can cause small necrotic spots to form on leaves 1 or 2 days after application.

First, using clean seed to plant the beans is best to prevent the spread of the pathogen. Using contaminated seeds from plots where the disease was is an easy way to spread the disease to other locations. Secondly, spores that land on volunteer plants, which are plants that grow on their own from seeds floating by wind or birds, can be spread long distances by wind increasing the spread of the disease. These volunteer plants should be controlled early in the season often by the use of herbicides to kill the faba bean plant completely. Another way to control disease is to rotate crops; crops should be rotated about 500 meters from where the faba beans were last planted as a preventative measure. Since they are host specific if there are still spores present in that area they will not be able to infect the new crop planted. Resistance is another control method. Resistance is the most desired means of rust control. Planting a variety that is resistant to rust is helpful in preventing disease. Foliar fungicides are another way of control; recommended fungicides need to be applied before severe symptoms are seen.",

As discussed in the symptoms section, it is also capable of infecting the xylem, resulting in a systemic infection that causes wilting. \"D. dadantii\" typically originates from infected insects, vegetables or host plant residues. However, the bacteria are also able to survive in soils and other plants without infection. The ability of \"D. dadantii\" to live in the soil as a plant pathogen is regulated by virulence genes in response to environmental factors that control whether the bacterium is saphrophytic or pathogenic. When \"D. dadantii\" is virulent it enters primarily through hydathodes and wounds, with the assistance of jasmonates, where the bacteria rapidly breakdown the parenchymatous tissues with the use of pectic enzymes). \"D. dadantii\" produces many pectinases that are responsible for disassembly of the plant cell wall. After the cell wall is degraded, and the contents of the cell are accessed, \"D. dadantii\" catabolizes glucose by a fermentation pathway. After the plant has been accessed, colonization is a complicated process that requires many additional factors for successful infection. These factors include: \u201ccellulases, iron assimilation, a Hrp type III secretion system, exopolysaccharides, motility, and proteins involved in resistance against plant defense mechanisms\u201d. The plant attempts to resist the infection with different defense mechanisms and \"D. dadantii\" must overcome obstacles, such as defense barriers, secondary metabolites and toxic materials. An example of a plant defense mechanism is to produce a defensive barrier, such as a cork layer. However, when the infection is spread by larvae, the cork layer is eaten as quickly as it is made by the plant. Consequently, the protective cork layer is an ineffective protection mechanism. The bacteria continue to spread and multiply throughout the plant, moving in the intercellular spaces, within collapsed cells and the xylem. As the bacteria grow in numbers, additional hosts are infected through the spread of bacteria by: splashing water from infected plants, insects, and cultural practices including the use of contaminated tools, gloves and machinery and improper storage of cultivated crops or seeds. \"D. dadantii\" can be a problem year round, given the right environmental conditions exist.

Management strategies for \"blueberry shock virus\" are mainly aimed to prevent introduction and transmission of the virus to non-infected plants. A virus test is used to ensure that a nursery stock does not get infected. If plants are suspected to have the virus based off symptoms, growers are instructed to send in the symptomatic branches to a diagnostic lab for virus testing. ELISA or RT-PCR detects the virus from flower buds early in the season. Growers are instructed to watch for a rapid blight of flowers at bloom that is not caused by a spring freeze. \"Blueberry shock virus\" symptoms are identical to \"blueberry scorch virus\", Phomopsis twig blight and Botrytis blossom blight, so test suspicious plants immediately to ensure proper management of the disease. The grower can distinguish between these diseases by the scattered distribution of symptoms and the absence of fungal growth on blighted tissue on plants infected with blueberry shock virus. In addition, blueberry shock virus can be differentiated by its second flush of leaves later in the season.  If a plant is infected, there are two options for management. The first is to allow the virus to run its course. The plant will eventually recover and return to full production. This approach is common in regions where the disease is endemic. The second approach is to remove and burn the plant that is infected, to remove the source of inoculum. This approach is utilized in areas where the virus is not known to be present and if the infection is localized. Once the virus is present in a field, removal of infected plants based on symptoms or diagnostics will slow the spread of the virus but not completely prevent further spread. However, the disease cannot be eliminated just by removing plants that have visual symptoms of the disease. Sometimes a plant or whole field may be infected, but not show symptoms till months or years later. In this case, destruction of the entire field may be necessary in order to remove the virus. Chemical control may be utilized by using herbicides. Herbicides may be applied before the removal of plants to ensure that the root system of the plant will be killed. However, some leftover roots may produce suckers, so it is important to monitor the field for sucker development to ensure that all the disease is gone. If suckers are spotted, they can be killed by repeated cultivation or application of herbicides. Additionally, to reduce the spread and transmission of the virus, growers should not establish new plantings adjacent to infected fields or use planting stock from a field that is in remission.",

The systemic movement of PMTV is facilitated in large by a protein named TRIPLE GENE BLOCK1 (TGB1) which has an internal domain spurring transportation of the virus to neighboring cells, and an N-terminal domain used for long-distance (systemic) travel. This N-terminal domain of TGB1 has shown some promise as a target to limit systemic infection of the pathogen in \"N. benthamiana\", since systemic infection requires an interaction between a molecule called importin-a within the host plant and the N-terminal domain.

Additionally, excess water can lead to an increase in insects that feed on roots, making it easier for the pathogen to spread, as it can make its way into the plant through wounds. Water levels can be controlled by avoiding planting in areas that have poor drainage and controlling irrigation as to not overwater plants. Because \"P. irregulare\" has oospores that survive under harsh conditions, sanitation is very important to limit the spread. Contaminated irrigation systems, tools, and seeds can spread the disease, so disinfection with heat or chemicals are necessary to prevent further spread, as well as purchasing certified clean seed. Additionally, in greenhouses scenarios it is important to sanitize soil, work benches, and tools with heat or chemicals as well. It is also important to avoid over-fertilizing plants, as fertilizers can suppress plant defenses and damage roots, making it easier for \"P. irregulare\" to infect. Finally, if you have had previous problems with \"Pythium irregulare\", you can take preventative measures by mixing fungicides into the soil, although this is more easily achieved in a greenhouse scenario. It is important to create a fungicide plan with different rotations of fungicides if you choose to prevent disease this way in order to prevent the pathogen from becoming resistant to the fungicide. Some fungicides used to prevent \"P. irregulare\" include mefenoxam, fosetyl-Al, and etridiazole. Additionally, certain biological agents such as \"Trichoderma harzianum\" and \"Gliocladium virens\" can be used as biological control measures to prevent infection; however, this is also a more plausible control method in a greenhouse, again because it needs to be mixed into the soil. Crop rotation is not necessarily a good option for \"P. irregulare\" control because many crops are viable hosts, oospores can survive in the soil for many years, and the pathogen can survive on organic matter; however, rotation with a non-host crop may be able to reduce the pathogen load, thus decreasing infection in subsequent years",

High saline content in the soil can promote infection at lower temperature and humidity that is ideal for the pathogen. Excessive nitrogen fertilization will also increase the chance of infection because the nitrogen decreases the function of the plant\u2019s innate defense response, and it also damages the ends of the roots, which are the primary mode of infection. Furthermore, the medium in which plants are grown dictates affects the severity of Pythium infection.

Bacterial leaf streak of wheat is a seed-borne disease and is primarily transported by seed, but can also be transmitted by plant-to-plant contact within its lifecycle. Epidemics are typically observed late in the growing season and in wet environments.  Moisture facilitates the release of the pathogen from the inoculated seed, which leads to leaf colonization and invasion of tissue. Bacteria on the moist leaf surface enter through leaf openings, such as the stomata or wounds. Under moderately warm weather conditions (15-30 degrees Celsius) bacteria will begin to release and multiply in the plant parenchyma tissue. The bacteria then inject a number of effector proteins into the plant with a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS). The T3SS effectors in Xanthomonas are Transcription Activator-like effectors (TAL effectors). These TAL effectors activate the production of plant genes that are beneficial to bacterial infection. The bacteria spreads and progresses vertically up the plant. The bacterial masses cause elongated streaks along the veins of the plant.  Water collection on leaves also leads to the spread of the organism, increasing the number of lesions on leaves. Rain, wind, insects, and plant-to-plant contact may spread the disease in the season and cause reinfection.  After the plant is harvested or dies, the bacteria may overwinter in the soil; although, its survival rate is much greater when crop debris is present. However, the bacteria cannot survive on decomposing matter alone and free bacteria cannot survive for more than 14 days in hot dry weather.

When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. \"Agrobacterium\" performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA into the plant's genome. See above for more details about the process of plasmid DNA insertion into the host genome. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes this tissue to become crushed and/or distorted. The crushed vessels lead to reduced water flow in the xylem. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant. Crown gall disease caused by \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" can be controlled by using various different methods. The best way to control this disease is to take preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools so as to avoid infecting new plants. Performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields are also valuable practices. Avoiding wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation is important for preventing disease. In horticultural techniques in which multiple plants are joined together to grow as one, such as budding and grafting these techniques lead to plant wounds. Wounds are the primary location of bacterial entry into the host plant. Therefore, it is advisable to perform these techniques during times of the year when \"Agrobacteria\" are not active. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection, since these insects cause wounds (aka bacterial entryways) in the plant roots. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.",

Free Ca levels in the cytoplasm increases in response to a pathogenic infection. Ca signatures of this nature usually activate the plant defense system by inducing defense-related genes and the hypersensitive cell death. CaMs, CMLs and CaM-binding proteins are some of the recently identified elements of the plant defense signaling pathways. Several CML genes in tobacco, bean and tomato are responsive to pathogens. CML43 is a CaM-related protein that, as isolated from APR134 gene in the disease-resistant leaves of \"Arabidopsis\" for gene expression analysis, is rapidly induced when the leaves are inoculated with \"Pseudomonas syringae.\" These genes are also found in tomatoes (\"Solanum lycopersicum).\" The CML43 from the APR134 also binds to Ca ions in vitro which shows that CML43 and APR134 are, hence, involved in the Ca-dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens. The CML9 expression in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is rapidly induced by phytopathogenic bacteria, flagellin and salicylic acid. Expression of soybean SCaM4 and SCaM5 in transgenic \"tobacco\" and \"Arabidopsis\" causes an activation of genes related to pathogen resistance and also results in enhanced resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogen infection. The same is not true for soybean SCaM1 and SCaM2 that are highly conserved CaM isoforms. The \"At\"BAG6 protein is a CaM-binding protein that binds to CaM only in the absence of Ca and not in the presence of it. \"At\"BAG6 is responsible for the hypersensitive response of programmed cell death in order to prevent the spread of pathogen infection or to restrict pathogen growth. Mutations in the CaM binding proteins can lead to severe effects on the defense response of the plants towards pathogen infections. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are functional protein channels in the plasma membrane that have overlapping CaM binding sites transport divalent cations such as Ca. However, the exact role of the positioning of the CNGCs in this pathway for plant defense is still unclear.",

Microsclerotia are masses of hyphae that are produced in the dying part of the plant and are used to infect healthy plants. When a canola root is near the microsclerotia, the fungi will grow towards it. Root exudates cause the microsclerotia to germinate. Once the fungus has entered the root, it will produce hyphae to move through the plant. The fungi also use conidia to transport. Once the fungi reaches the xylem, it can quickly colonize the plant. This causes the plant to start slowly dying. This is due to fungal growth and plant defenses clogging the xylem, so the plant cannot take up nutrients in this area.

Although the term pathogenesis-related proteins by itself may give the impression that (all) proteins common to pathological processes in a given plant species can be considered PRs, proteins that are constitutively present in low, yet readily detectable amounts, but which are increased substantially by pathogen infection, such as oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes or general enzymes of aromatic biosynthesis, have been excluded. However, if specific isoforms of such enzymes do not normally occur but are induced as a result of infection, such isoenzymes do belong to the PRs. The major criterion for inclusion among the PRs is that the protein concerned is newly expressed upon infection, although not necessarily in all pathological conditions. These considerations imply that the characteristics of the induction of PRs take priority over other identifying characteristics, such as chemical properties and cellular localization.18 Proteins that are induced exclusively during disease development in compatible host\u2013pathogen combinations have hardly been considered as PRs. Rather, the \u201cclassical\u201d PRs are a collective set of novel proteins associated with host defense mainly in incompatible interactions and, thus, are related primarily to a special type of pathogenesis, i.e., one culminating in the impediment of further pathogen progress. In compatible host\u2013pathogen interactions, pathogenesis, symptom expression, and reduction of growth are generally more severe, and enzyme activities may be increased to high levels, but novel host proteins have been observed only occasionally and remain poorly characterized. Proteins expressed under such conditions seem to be rather specific, being induced under the influence of particular pathogens but not others. This situation contrasts with the massive, apparently coordinated, induction of a common set of PRs in virtually any incompatible interaction, which in some cases can amount to 10% of the total soluble protein of the leaf. For this reason, PRs have been implicated in the resistance response and, more specifically, in the acquired resistance that is induced accompanying necrotic lesion formation in various plant species. When plants are locally infected with a pathogen inducing hypersensitive necrosis, they acquire systemically enhanced resistance to subsequent infection by various types of pathogens, and this systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is associated with the induction of PRs in tissues distant from the original inoculation site.1,7,8,19 Such observations suggested that PRs are defense proteins functioning in limiting pathogen multiplication and/or spread. Among the many metabolic alterations characteristic of a hypersensitive response, induction of PRs is a relatively late event,14 and their contribution to resistance against the initial infection is likely to be limited. In contrast, PRs induced in noninfected, distant leaves as a result of primary infection might afford an enhanced level of protection, resulting in reduced size or number of lesions, or even in reduced systemic symptom severity, upon further infection. The \u201crelated situations\u201d in which PRs were found to be induced, seem to prove the point: application of chemicals that mimic the effect of pathogen infection or induce some aspects of the host response, as well as wound responses that give rise to proteins that are also induced during infections, can induce both PRs and acquired resistance. This is the case for salicylic acid, for example, which has since been shown to be an essential intermediate in the signal\u2013transduction pathway leading to the induction of PRs in tobacco.",

If infected however, the level of PR proteins tends to increase further. PR proteins are not the only mechanism of preventing infection however, as soil drenches of BABA that do not induce PR protein production, still confer resistance. This may be due to differences between plant families, as the Solanaceae (potato, tomato, pepper) respond by producing PR proteins without any pathogen present, whereas crucifers (Arabidopsis, cauliflower) require a pathogen to induce PR proteins. In other pathosystems, phytoalexins (anti-microbial compounds) accumulate to higher levels in BABA treated plants when they are infected by pathogens, but not when the pathogen is not present.

As discussed in the symptoms section, it is also capable of infecting the xylem, resulting in a systemic infection that causes wilting. \"D. dadantii\" typically originates from infected insects, vegetables or host plant residues. However, the bacteria are also able to survive in soils and other plants without infection. The ability of \"D. dadantii\" to live in the soil as a plant pathogen is regulated by virulence genes in response to environmental factors that control whether the bacterium is saphrophytic or pathogenic. When \"D. dadantii\" is virulent it enters primarily through hydathodes and wounds, with the assistance of jasmonates, where the bacteria rapidly breakdown the parenchymatous tissues with the use of pectic enzymes). \"D. dadantii\" produces many pectinases that are responsible for disassembly of the plant cell wall. After the cell wall is degraded, and the contents of the cell are accessed, \"D. dadantii\" catabolizes glucose by a fermentation pathway. After the plant has been accessed, colonization is a complicated process that requires many additional factors for successful infection. These factors include: \u201ccellulases, iron assimilation, a Hrp type III secretion system, exopolysaccharides, motility, and proteins involved in resistance against plant defense mechanisms\u201d. The plant attempts to resist the infection with different defense mechanisms and \"D. dadantii\" must overcome obstacles, such as defense barriers, secondary metabolites and toxic materials. An example of a plant defense mechanism is to produce a defensive barrier, such as a cork layer. However, when the infection is spread by larvae, the cork layer is eaten as quickly as it is made by the plant. Consequently, the protective cork layer is an ineffective protection mechanism. The bacteria continue to spread and multiply throughout the plant, moving in the intercellular spaces, within collapsed cells and the xylem. As the bacteria grow in numbers, additional hosts are infected through the spread of bacteria by: splashing water from infected plants, insects, and cultural practices including the use of contaminated tools, gloves and machinery and improper storage of cultivated crops or seeds. \"D. dadantii\" can be a problem year round, given the right environmental conditions exist. It is able to infect plants in greenhouses, indoor interiorscapes and tropical areas where temperatures and humidity remains high. At higher latitudes, infections are mainly during the hot and humid summer months.",

It survives the winter on lesions of previously infected fruit, plant debris, or simply in the soil. This fungus can survive up to a year in the soil. Conidia is released in the spring when the fungus is ready to infect its host, the eggplant. The conidia disperse by air or wind, or by rain-splash, and are able to infect a suitable host this way. Conidia infect an eggplant host by landing on the lower surface young leaves and entering the leaf through stomata or other natural openings of the plant or wounds on the plant. From infection, there appear to be visible lesions on the leaves. The germ tube of the fungus can enter both closed and open stomata. Multiple germ tubes from various conidia can enter the same stomata. This fungus has the best infection rates among young leaves and has a reduced infection rate of mature leaves. It is thought that the reduced infection rate of mature leaves is due to the saprophytic microflora on the leaves and the anti-fungal compounds produced by the mature leaf. This fungus produces secondary conidia within the same season; this furthers the disease cycle and allows the fungus to infect more plants. Mycelium rapidly develops. Under near perfect conditions, mycelium can develop within twelve hours of infection. The mycelium protects the next generation of conidia and ensures survival through the winter via conidiophores, and the cycle starts again the next season.",

Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response.

SAR is important for plants to resist disease, as well as to recover from disease once formed. SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called \"broad spectrum\". SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or \"pathogenesis-related\" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA). The pathogen-induced SA signal activates a molecular signal transduction pathway that is identified by a gene called \"NIM1\", \"NPR1\" or \"SAI1\" (three names for the same gene) in the model genetic system \"Arabidopsis thaliana\".

This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized encounter. In response, many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to suppress the RNAi response. These include viral proteins that bind short double-stranded RNA fragments with single-stranded overhang ends, such as those produced by dicer.
