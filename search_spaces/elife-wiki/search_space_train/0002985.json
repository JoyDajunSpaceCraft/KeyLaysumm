While NURR1 is a key protein, there are other factors required as research shows that solely expressing NURR1 fails to stimulate this phenotypic gene expression. One of these suggested factors is winged-helix transcription factor 2 (Foxa2). Studies have found these two factors to be within the same region of developing dopaminergic neurons, both of these factors were present in order to have expression for the dopamine phenotype.  Research has been conducted on Nurr1\u2019s role in inflammation, and may provide important information in treating disorders caused by dopaminergic neuron disease. Inflammation in the CNS can result from activated microglia (macrophage analogs for the central nervous system) and other pro-inflammatory factors, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS binds to toll-like receptors (TLR), which induces inflammatory gene expression by promoting signal-dependent transcription factors. To determine which cells are dopaminergic, experiments measured the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is needed for dopamine synthesis. It has been shown that Nurr1 protects dopaminergic neurons from LPS-induced inflammation, by reducing inflammatory gene expression in microglia and astrocytes. When a short hairpin for Nurr1 was expressed in microglia and astrocytes, these cells produced inflammatory mediators, such as TNFa, NO synthase and IL-1\u03b2, supporting the conclusion that reduced Nurr1 promotes inflammation and leads to cell death of dopaminergic neurons. Nurr1 interacts with the transcription factor complex NF-\u03baB-p65 on the inflammatory gene promoters. However, Nurr1 is dependent on other factors to be able to participate in these interactions. Nurr1 needs to be sumoylated and its co-regulating factor, glycogen synthase kinase 3, needs to be phosphorylated for these interactions to occur. Sumolyated Nurr1 recruits CoREST, a complex made of several proteins that assembles chromatin-modifying enzymes. The Nurr1/CoREST complex inhibits transcription of inflammatory genes.",

            "document": "Septic shock . In gram-negative sepsis, free LPS attaches to a circulating LPS-binding protein, and the complex then binds to the CD14 receptor on monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Engagement of CD14 (even at doses as minute as 10 pg/mL) results in intracellular signaling via an associated \"Toll-like receptor\" protein 4 (TLR-4). This signaling results in the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-\u03baB), which leads to transcription of a number of genes that trigger a proinflammatory response. It was the result of significant activation of mononuclear cells and synthesis of effector cytokines. It also results in profound activation of mononuclear cells and the production of potent effector cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. TLR-mediated activation helps to trigger the innate immune system to efficiently eradicate invading microbes, but the cytokines they produce also act on endothelial cells. There, they have a variety of effects, including reduced synthesis of anticoagulation factors such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor and thrombomodulin. The effects of the cytokines may be amplified by TLR-4 engagement on endothelial cells. In response to inflammation, a compensatory reaction of production of anti-inflammatory substances such as IL-4, IL-10 antagonists, IL-1 receptor, and cortisol occurs. This is called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). Both the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions are responsible for the course of sepsis and are described as MARS (Mixed Antagonist Response Syndrome). The aim of these processes is to keep inflammation at an appropriate level. CARS often leads to suppression of the immune system, which leaves patients vulnerable to secondary infection. It was once thought that SIRS or CARS could predominate in a septic individual, and it was proposed that CARS follows SIRS in a two-wave process. It is now believed that the systemic inflammatory response and the compensatory anti-inflammatory response occur simultaneously.",

Leptin resistance plays a role in the process where appetite overrules the message of satiety. Angptl2 then starts an inflammatory cascade causing blood vessels to remodel and attract macrophages. Angptl2 is an adipocyte-derived inflammatory mediator linking obesity to systemic insulin resistance.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect microorganisms by recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and IL-1R family members respond the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines. These receptors initiate an intracellular signaling cascade through adaptor proteins, primarily, MyD88. This is followed by the activation of IRAKs. TLRs and IL-1R members have a highly conserved amino acid sequence in their cytoplasmic domain called the Toll/Interleukin-1 (TIR) domain. The elicitation of different TLRs/IL-1Rs results in similar signaling cascades due to their homologous TIR motif leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, which initiates a nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and AP-1-dependent transcriptional response of pro-inflammatory genes.

Because NF-\u03baB controls many genes involved in inflammation, it is not surprising that NF-\u03baB is found to be chronically active in many inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, sepsis, gastritis, asthma, atherosclerosis and others. It is important to note though, that elevation of some NF-\u03baB activators, such as osteoprotegerin (OPG), are associated with elevated mortality, especially from cardiovascular diseases. Elevated NF-\u03baB has also been associated with schizophrenia. Recently, NF-\u03baB activation has been suggested as a possible molecular mechanism for the catabolic effects of cigarette smoke in skeletal muscle and sarcopenia. Research has shown that during inflammation the function of a cell depends on signals it activates in response to contact with adjacent cells and to combinations of hormones, especially cytokines that act on it through specific receptors. A cells\u2019 phenotype within a tissue develops through mutual stimulation of feedback signals that coordinate its function with other cells; this is especially evident during reprogramming of cell function when a tissue is exposed to inflammation, because cells alter their phenotype, and gradually express combinations of genes that prepare the tissue for regeneration after the cause of inflammation is removed. Particularly important are feedback responses that develop between tissue resident cells, and circulating cells of the immune system. Fidelity of feedback responses between diverse cell types and the immune system depends on the integrity of mechanisms that limit the range of genes activated by NF-\u03baB, allowing only expression of genes which contribute to an effective immune response and subsequently, a complete restoration of tissue function after resolution of inflammation. In cancer, mechanisms that regulate gene expression in response to inflammatory stimuli are altered to the point that a cell ceases to link its survival with the mechanisms that coordinate its phenotype and its function with the rest of the tissue. This is often evident in severely compromised regulation of NF-\u03baB activity, which allows cancer cells to express abnormal cohorts of NF-\u03baB target genes. This results in not only the cancer cells functioning abnormally: cells of surrounding tissue alter their function and cease to support the organism exclusively. Additionally, several types of cells in the microenvironment of cancer may change their phenotypes to support cancer growth. Inflammation, therefore, is a process that tests the fidelity of tissue components because the process that leads to tissue regeneration requires coordination of gene expression between diverse cell types.",

However, if enlargement of fat cells and fat tissue causes them to become \"sick\", then important fat tissue functions are disrupted, and deranged responses contribute to metabolic disease. When excessive body weight leads to adiposopathy, this represents a hormone or endocrine disease. Additionally, fat cells and fat tissue also produce many different types of immune factors. Inflammation is a contributing cause to metabolic disease, and the ultimate contribution of fat tissue to inflammation is determined by the production of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. From a pro-inflammatory standpoint, fat tissue (which includes fat cells and other cells, such as immune cells) produces factors including: (1) adipokines with cytokine activity such as leptin, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; (2) acute phase proteins / reactants such as C-reactive protein; (3) adipokines of the alternative complement system; (4) chemotactic/chemoattractant adipokines; and prostaglandins (eicosanoids). From an anti-inflammatory standpoint, fat tissue produces various anti-inflammatory factors with the most commonly described being adiponectin.

Gut flora can also regulate the production of antibodies by the immune system. One function of this regulation is to cause B cells to class switch to IgA. In most cases B cells need activation from T helper cells to induce class switching; however, in another pathway, gut flora cause NF-kB signaling by intestinal epithelial cells which results in further signaling molecules being secreted. These signaling molecules interact with B cells to induce class switching to IgA. IgA is an important type of antibody that is used in mucosal environments like the gut.

Studies in human RPE cells have suggested that the presence of oxidative stress triggering molecules, such as HO causes the fragmentation of the DNA that in turn triggers apoptosis. These studies have proposed that PD1 acts as a signaling molecule and through its ligand-receptor interaction down-regulates the expression of genes, such as the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. The inhibition of NF-\u03baB results in the down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory gene COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) which is responsible for the release of prostaglandins, a potent pro-inflammatory mediator. In addition, PD1 has an important role in regulating the expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bax and Bad) that precedes the release of the cytochrome c complex from the mitochondria and the formation of the apoptosome. The presence of PD1 up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, while it inhibits the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad. Specifically, PD1 regulates this protein family by promoting the dephosphorylation of Bcl-x by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at residue Ser-62 which in turn heterodimerizes with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and inactivates it. Consequently, the activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins results in the inhibition of the caspase 3 enzyme, thus preventing apoptosis and promoting RPE cell survival.",

Activated protein C binds to endothelial protein C receptor and subsequently cleaves the endothelial cell protease activated receptor-1, not only altering coagulation profiles but down-regulating pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators, up-regulation of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways and stabilization of the endothelial cell barrier functions.",

IP activators inhibit the adherence of circulating platelets and leukocytes adherence to vascular endothelium thereby blocking their entry into sites of tissue disturbance.

These actions, along with its anti-inflammatory effects, may underlie the ability of IP gene knockout in an ApoE(\u2212/\u2212) mosue model to cause an accelerated rate of developing atherosclerosis. Mouse studies indicate that the PGI-IP axis activates cellular signaling pathways that tend to suppress allergic inflammation. The axis inhibits bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (i.e. antigen-presenting cells that process antigen material, present it on their surfaces for delivery to T cells, and otherwise regulate innate and adaptive immune system responses) from producing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-12, TNF-alpha, IL-1-alpha, and IL-6) while stimulating them to increase production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. IP receptor activation of these cells also blocks their lipopolysaccharide-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory cell surface proteins (i.e. CD86, CD40, and MHC class II molecules) that are critical for developing adaptive immune responses. IL receptor-activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells showed a greatly reduced ability to stimulate the proliferation of T helper cell as well as the ability of these cells to produce pro-allergic cytokines (i.e. IL-5 and IL-13)s. In a mouse model of allergic inflammation, PGI reduced the maturation and migration of lung mature dendritic cells to Mediastinal lymph nodes while increasing the egress of immature dendritic cells away from the lung. These effects resulted in a decrease in allergen-induced responses of the cells mediating allergic reactivity, TH-2 cells. These IP-induced responses likely contribute to its apparent function in inhibiting certain mouse inflammation responses as exemplified by the failure of IP receptor deficient mice to develop full lung airway allergic responses to ovalbumin in a model of allergic inflammation.",

            "document": "NF-\u03baB . In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB), which are proteins that contain multiple copies of a sequence called ankyrin repeats. By virtue of their ankyrin repeat domains, the I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of NF-\u03baB proteins and keep them sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. I\u03baBs are a family of related proteins that have an N-terminal regulatory domain, followed by six or more ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain near their C terminus. Although the I\u03baB family consists of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and Bcl-3, the best-studied and major I\u03baB protein is I\u03baB\u03b1. Due to the presence of ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal halves, p105 and p100 also function as I\u03baB proteins. The c-terminal half of p100, that is often referred to as I\u03baB\u03b4, also functions as an inhibitor. I\u03baB\u03b4 degradation in response to developmental stimuli, such as those transduced through LT\u03b2R, potentiate NF-\u03baB dimer activation in a NIK dependent non-canonical pathway. Activation of the NF-\u03baB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of I\u03baB proteins. This occurs primarily via activation of a kinase called the I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits and a \"master\" regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) or IKK gamma. When activated by signals, usually coming from the outside of the cell, the I\u03baB kinase phosphorylates two serine residues located in an I\u03baB regulatory domain. When phosphorylated on these serines (e.g., serines 32 and 36 in human I\u03baB\u03b1), the I\u03baB proteins are modified by a process called ubiquitination, which then leads them to be degraded by a cell structure called the proteasome.  With the degradation of I\u03baB, the NF-\u03baB complex is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can 'turn on' the expression of specific genes that have DNA-binding sites for NF-\u03baB nearby. The activation of these genes by NF-\u03baB then leads to the given physiological response, for example, an inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, or cellular proliferation. Translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus can be detected immunocytochemically and measured by laser scanning cytometry. NF-\u03baB turns on expression of its own repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. The newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 then re-inhibits NF-\u03baB and, thus, forms an auto feedback loop, which results in oscillating levels of NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, several viruses, including the AIDS virus HIV, have binding sites for NF-\u03baB that controls the expression of viral genes, which in turn contribute to viral replication or viral pathogenicity. In the case of HIV-1, activation of NF-\u03baB may, at least in part, be involved in activation of the virus from a latent, inactive state. YopP is a factor secreted by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, that prevents the ubiquitination of I\u03baB. This causes this pathogen to effectively inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and thus block the immune response of a human infected with Yersinia.",

The airway epithelium together with alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells play a major role in the initial recognition of bacterial products getting into the lower airways with the air. Since some of these products are potent proinflammatory stimuli it is extremely important for the immune system to distinguish between pathogens and non-pathogenic commensals. This prevents the development of constant inflammation and forms tolerance against harmless microbiota.  This process becomes much more intriguing when taking into account that commensals often share their surface molecules with pathogens. Epithelial cells are equipped with very sensitive recognition tools - toll like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) which recognize a broad variety of microbial structural components. After recognition of pathogenic bacteria proinflammatory pathways are activated and cellular components of the adaptive and innate immunity are recruited to the infection site. One key regulator in this process is the NF-\u03baB which translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and activates pro-inflammatory genes in epithelial cells and macrophages.

However, in a microgravity environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur. Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place\u2014neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, because this is the region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity.

The pathogenesis of Paget's disease is described in four stages: Initially, there is a marked increase in the rate of bone resorption in localized areas, caused by large and numerous osteoclasts. These localized areas of pathological destruction of bone tissue (osteolysis) are seen radiologically as an advancing lytic wedge in long bones or the skull. When this occurs in the skull, it is called osteoporosis circumscripta. The osteolysis is followed by a compensatory increase in bone formation induced by the bone forming cells, called osteoblasts, that are recruited to the area. This is associated with accelerated deposition of lamellar bone in a disorganized fashion. This intense cellular activity produces a chaotic picture of trabecular bone (\"mosaic\" pattern), rather than the normal linear lamellar pattern. The resorbed bone is replaced and the marrow spaces are filled by an excess of fibrous connective tissue with a marked increase in blood vessels, causing the bone to become hypervascular. The bone hypercellularity may then diminish, leaving a dense \"pagetic bone\", also known as burned-out Paget's disease. A later phase of the disease is characterized by the replacement of normal bone marrow with highly vascular fibrous tissue.",

Shortly thereafter, two studies reported that gain-of-function mutations in LRP5 caused high bone mass. Many bone density related diseases are caused by mutations in the LRP5 gene. There is controversy whether bone grows through Lrp5 through bone or the intestine. The majority of the current data supports the concept that bone mass is controlled by LRP5 through the osteocytes. Mice with the same Lrp5 gain-of-function mutations as also have high bone mass. The high bone mass is maintained when the mutation only occurs in limbs or in cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Bone mechanotransduction occurs through Lrp5 and is suppressed if Lrp5 is removed in only osteocytes. There are promising osteoporosis clinical trials targeting sclerostin, an osteocyte-specific protein which inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to Lrp5. An alternative model that has been verified in mice and in humans is that Lrp5 controls bone formation by inhibiting expression of TPH1, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin, a molecule that regulates bone formation, in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum and that excess plasma serotonin leads to inhibition in bone. Another study found that a different Tph1-inhibitor decreased serotonin levels in the blood and intestine, but did not affect bone mass or markers of bone formation.",

Bone resorption is the normal destruction of bone by osteoclasts, which are indirectly stimulated by PTH. Stimulation is indirect since osteoclasts do not have a receptor for PTH; rather, PTH binds to osteoblasts, the cells responsible for creating bone. Binding stimulates osteoblasts to increase their expression of RANKL and inhibits their secretion of Osteoprotegerin (OPG). Free OPG competitively binds to RANKL as a decoy receptor, preventing RANKL from interacting with RANK, a receptor for RANKL. The binding of RANKL to RANK (facilitated by the decreased amount of OPG available for binding the excess RANKL) stimulates these osteoclast precursors to fuse, forming new osteoclasts, which ultimately enhances bone resorption. Another mechanism to regulate this pathways as PTH does is by estrogen. Estrogen suppresses T cell TNF production by regulating T cell differentiation and activity in the bone marrow, thymus, and peripheral lymphoid organs.

The thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary, or adrenal glands, and the pancreas are parts of the endocrine system, and, therefore are associated with the endocrine bone disease.

The thyroid gland produces thyroxin (T3, and T4) which is necessary for normal development of the nervous system. Its functions include: promoting growth, increasing basal metabolic rate and controlling body temperature. Adequate iodine intake is necessary for the production of thyroid hormone. According to Payton R. G. et al., a common disorder of the thyroid gland is hypothyroidism, which is more prevalent in women than in men. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include cold intolerance, weight gain, fatigue, anemia, difficulty concentrating, amenorrhea, bradycardia (low heart rate) and goiter. Another hormone that is secreted by Para follicular cells of the thyroid gland is calcitonin. Calcitonin works in an antagonistic fashion with parathyroid hormone (PTH): both regulate the level of calcium in the blood. Blood calcium level is tightly regulated by these two hormones. The cells of our bone that is involved in bone formation and bone breakdown is osteoblast and osteoclast respectively. Osteoclasts are cells of bones that promote bone demineralization or bone resorption. In contrast, Osteoblast promotes calcium absorption by the bone therefore, promoting bone mineralization and formation of new bones. Thus Calcitonin activates osteoblasts, therefore decrease blood calcium levels by decreasing bone breakdown (resorption) by inhibiting osteoclast. Whereas, PTH activates osteoclast and thereby increases blood calcium. The hormone produced by the thyroid gland has big impact on bone density, blood calcium levee. Abnormalities of the thyroid gland impact bone disease such as osteoporosis, a condition that is common in women but men can be diagnosed with this silent disease as well as it mainly affects elderly individual.",

Integrin-mediated adhesion between cancer cells and osteoclasts in bone metastases induces phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in osteoclasts, which in turn induces osteoclast differentiation and survival. Metastatic breast-cancer cells excrete lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) which binds to receptors on tumor cells, inducing cell proliferation and release of cytokines(IL-6 and IL-8, potent bone resorptive agents) and stimulating bone resorption. After the breast-cancer cells have left the primary tumor, they interact with the bone microenvironment and secrete osteolytic factors capable of osteoclast formation and bone resorption.

In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB), which are proteins that contain multiple copies of a sequence called ankyrin repeats. By virtue of their ankyrin repeat domains, the I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of NF-\u03baB proteins and keep them sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. I\u03baBs are a family of related proteins that have an N-terminal regulatory domain, followed by six or more ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain near their C terminus. Although the I\u03baB family consists of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and Bcl-3, the best-studied and major I\u03baB protein is I\u03baB\u03b1. Due to the presence of ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal halves, p105 and p100 also function as I\u03baB proteins. The c-terminal half of p100, that is often referred to as I\u03baB\u03b4, also functions as an inhibitor. I\u03baB\u03b4 degradation in response to developmental stimuli, such as those transduced through LT\u03b2R, potentiate NF-\u03baB dimer activation in a NIK dependent non-canonical pathway. Activation of the NF-\u03baB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of I\u03baB proteins. This occurs primarily via activation of a kinase called the I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits and a \"master\" regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) or IKK gamma. When activated by signals, usually coming from the outside of the cell, the I\u03baB kinase phosphorylates two serine residues located in an I\u03baB regulatory domain. When phosphorylated on these serines (e.g., serines 32 and 36 in human I\u03baB\u03b1), the I\u03baB proteins are modified by a process called ubiquitination, which then leads them to be degraded by a cell structure called the proteasome.  With the degradation of I\u03baB, the NF-\u03baB complex is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can 'turn on' the expression of specific genes that have DNA-binding sites for NF-\u03baB nearby. The activation of these genes by NF-\u03baB then leads to the given physiological response, for example, an inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, or cellular proliferation. Translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus can be detected immunocytochemically and measured by laser scanning cytometry. NF-\u03baB turns on expression of its own repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. The newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 then re-inhibits NF-\u03baB and, thus, forms an auto feedback loop, which results in oscillating levels of NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, several viruses, including the AIDS virus HIV, have binding sites for NF-\u03baB that controls the expression of viral genes, which in turn contribute to viral replication or viral pathogenicity. In the case of HIV-1, activation of NF-\u03baB may, at least in part, be involved in activation of the virus from a latent, inactive state. YopP is a factor secreted by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, that prevents the ubiquitination of I\u03baB. This causes this pathogen to effectively inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and thus block the immune response of a human infected with Yersinia.",
