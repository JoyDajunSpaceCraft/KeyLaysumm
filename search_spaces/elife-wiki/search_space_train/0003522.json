Diazotrophic cyanobacteria have evolved a number of mechanisms to ensure that oxygen doesn\u2019t interfere with the oxygen-sensitive enzyme complex responsible for nitrogen fixation, since these enzymes are sensitive to oxygen. Oxygen is especially toxic to nitrogenase. One way in which nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, such as those in the genera \"Nostoc\" and \"Anabaena\", avoid oxygen toxicity is through specialized cells called heterocysts that lack photosystem II and hence do not have oxygen evolution. As a diazotrophic cyanobacterium that has oxygen-evolving photosystem II, one of the ways by which \"Crocosphaera watsonii\" protects its nitrogenase from oxygen is through the adaptation of a diel rhythm. This temporally separates carbon and nitrogen metabolism between day and night, respectively. Since an array of enzymes are involved in the regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, this separation entails temporal regulation of many enzymes and processes in these bacteria. Consistent with this, many genes involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis show variation in transcription between day and night. This difference in gene expression between light and dark periods for genes involved in nitrogen fixation was about ten times bigger than for genes involved in photosynthesis, suggesting more stable photosystems compared to nitrogenase in these bacteria. The expression of many genes involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis have been individually monitored. These include genes encoding the proteins nifH, nifX, glutamate synthetase, ntcA, glnB-like proteins and glgP, all of which have essential roles in nitrogen fixation. The expression of all these genes were at their peak at the beginning of dark period and were at their minimum in the early light period. Furthermore, genes encoding for photosynthetic proteins such as photosystem I subunit VII (psaC), the photosystem II D1 protein (psbA1) and the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex protein (psbO), and glgA showed diel variation in expression, with the highest and lowest expression at daytime and nighttime, respectively. About 30% of the genome of \"Crocosphaera watsonii\" showed diel variation in expression, indicating its importance. All of these patterns indicate a temporal separation of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in \"Crocosphaera watsonii.\"",

The resulting damage caused by singlet oxygen reduces the photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplasts. In plants exposed to excess light, the increased production of singlet oxygen can result in cell death. Various substances such as carotenoids, tocopherols and plastoquinones contained in chloroplasts quench singlet oxygen and protect against its toxic effects. In addition to direct toxicity, singlet oxygen acts a signaling molecule. Oxidized products of \u03b2-carotene arising from the presence of singlet oxygen act as second messengers that can either protect against singlet oxygen induced toxicity or initiate programmed cell death.

After the eight-month period, despite the fact that the \"Elysia chlorotica\" were less green and more yellowish in colour, the majority of the chloroplasts within the slugs appeared to have remained intact while maintaining their fine structure. By spending less energy on activities such as finding food, the slugs can invest this precious energy into other important activities. Although \"Elysia chlorotica\" are unable to synthesize their own chloroplasts, the ability to maintain the chloroplasts in a functional state indicates that \"Elysia chlorotica\" could possess photosynthesis-supporting genes within its own nuclear genome, possibly acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Since chloroplast DNA alone encodes for just 10% of the proteins required for proper photosynthesis, scientists investigated the \"Elysia chlorotica\" genome for potential genes that could support chloroplast survival and photosynthesis. The researchers found a vital algal gene, \"psbO\" (a nuclear gene encoding for a manganese-stabilizing protein within the photosystem II complex) in the sea slug's DNA, identical to the algal version. They concluded that the gene was likely to have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer, as it was already present in the eggs and sex cells of \"Elysia chlorotica\". It is due to this ability to utilize horizontal gene transfer that the chloroplasts are able to be used as efficiently as they have been. If an organism did not incorporate the chloroplasts and corresponding genes into its own cells and genome, the algal cells would need to be fed upon more often due to a lack of efficiency in the use and preservation of the chloroplasts.

They maintain the cells and metabolise the photosynthetic products; this process is termed kleptoplasty, and the sacoglossans are the only animals to employ it; some ciliates and foramanifera (protists) also employ the strategy. Sacoglossans have been known to survive for months living solely on the photosynthetic products of their acquired plastids. This process is somewhat mystifying, as the upkeep of chloroplasts usually requires interaction with genes encoded in the plant cell nucleus. This almost seems to suggest that the genes have been laterally transferred from algae to the animals. DNA amplification experiments on \"Elysia chlorotica\" adults and eggs using \"Vaucheria litorea\" derived primers revealed the presence of psbO, an algal nuclear gene. These results were likely an artefact, as most recent results based on transcriptomic analysis and sequencing of genomic DNA from the slug's eggs reject the hypothesis that lateral gene transfer supports kleptoplast longevity. Sacoglossans are able to choose which method of feeding they utilize. The switch from active feeding to photosynthesis in sacoglossans is triggered by the shortage of food resource, and typically not preferred. If food is readily available, the animal will actively consume. Starvation periods (periods of photosynthesis and no active feeding) vary between species of sacoglossans from less than a week to over four months, and photosynthesis is used as a last resort mechanism to avoid mortality. Another unclear step in the process is how the chloroplasts are protected from digestion, and how they adapt to their new position in animal cells without the membranes that would control their environment in the algae. However it is achieved, kleptoplasty is an important strategy for many genera of Placobranchacaea. One species of \"Elysia\" feeds on a seasonally-calcifying alga. Because it is unable to penetrate the calcified cell walls, the animal can only feed for part of the year, relying on the ingested chloroplasts to survive whilst the foodstuff is calcified, until later in the season when the calcification is lost and the grazing can continue.",

Viral nucleic-acid replication and immediate synthesis of virus-encoded protein is considered to be the lytic cycle. Phages are considered lytic if they only have the capacity to enter the lytic cycle; whereas, temperate phage can either enter the lytic cycle or become stabely integrated with the host genome and enter the lysogenic cycle. To meet the metabolic demand of replication, viruses recruit a multitude of strategies to sequester nutrients from their host. One such technique is to starve their host cell. This is done by inhibiting the host cells CO fixation, which enables the cyanophage to recruit photosynthetically formed redox and ATP from the host cell to meet their nucleotide and metabolic response. Many cyanophages contain genes known as viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), which encode critical, rate-limiting steps of the host organism. AMGs encode genes for the pentose phosphate pathway, phosphate acquisition, sulfur metabolism, and DNA/RNA processing; these genes interfere with the metabolism of the host cell. Metagenomic analysis highly supports the notion that these genes promote viral replication through the degradation of host DNA and RNA, as well as a shift in host-cell metabolism to nucleotide biosynthesis. Cyanophages also use these genes to maintain host photosynthesis through the progression of the infection, shuttling the energy away from carbon fixation to anabolism, which the virus takes advantage of. AMGs also code for proteins, which aid in the repair of the host photosystem, which is susceptible to photodegradation. One such example is the D1 proteins which replace the host cells D1 protein when it becomes damaged. The virus up-regulates photosynthesis, which leads to an increased rate of D1 protein degradation, the host cell alone can not efficiently replace these proteins so the cyanophage replaces them for the host cell, allowing it to continue providing energy for the cyanophage replication cycle.",

Even in the very first studies, it was obvious that plants have a repair mechanism that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage. In 1966, Jones and Kok measured the action spectrum of photoinhibition and found that ultraviolet light is highly photoinhibitory. The visible-light part of the action spectrum was found to have a peak in the red-light region, suggesting that chlorophylls act as photoreceptors of photoinhibition. In the 1980s, photoinhibition became a popular topic in photosynthesis research, and the concept of a damaging reaction counteracted by a repair process was re-invented. Research was stimulated by a paper by Kyle, Ohad and Arntzen in 1984, showing that photoinhibition is accompanied by selective loss of a 32-kDa protein, later identified as the PSII reaction center protein D1. The photosensitivity of PSII from which the oxygen evolving complex had been inactivated with chemical treatment was studied in the 1980s and early 1990s. A paper by Imre Vass and coworkers in 1992 described the acceptor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. Measurements of production of singlet oxygen by photoinhibited PSII provided further evidence for an acceptor-side-type mechanism. The concept of a repair cycle that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage, evolved and was reviewed by Aro et al. in 1993. Many details of the repair cycle, including the finding that the FtsH protease plays an important role in the degradation of the D1 protein, have been discovered since. In 1996, a paper by Tyystj\u00e4rvi and Aro showed that the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity, a result that opposed the former assumption that photoinhibition is caused by the fraction of light energy that exceeds the maximum capability of photosynthesis. The following year, laser pulse photoinhibition experiments done by Itzhak Ohad's group led to the suggestion that charge recombination reactions may be damaging because they can lead to production of singlet oxygen. The molecular mechanism(s) of photoinhibition are constantly under discussion. The newest candidate is the manganese mechanism suggested 2005 by the group of Esa Tyystj\u00e4rvi.

When expressed, the myoD gene produces a protein referred to as MyoD (or MyoD1), which can bind certain DNA sequences, stop cell division, and elicit an entire program of muscle cell differentiation. In a series of sequential experiments, Weintraub and his students showed that myoD was able to convert fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) into myoblasts (skeletal muscle cells). Later studies by the same group of investigators at FHCRC further characterized the structural and functional characteristics of \"myoD\" and its nuclear-localized protein product, which were found to be present in organisms as diverse as nematode worms, frogs, mice, and humans. During the final years of his life, Weintraub's work used myoD to delve broadly and deeply into the areas of regulatory proteins, gene expression, and the molecular control of cell differentiation.

Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell.

Cullin-7 acts as scaffold protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The role of this complex is to tag damaged and excess proteins in the cell with ubiquitin. Intracellular and extracellular signals within the cell highly regulate when and which proteins are tagged with ubiquitin. Once attached to the protein, ubiquitin serves as a signaling molecule to the proteasomes, which then bind to the ubiquinated proteins and degrades them. This ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by breaking down unwanted proteins. Additionally, the system regulates the level of proteins involved in critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. Mutations in the CUL7 gene blocks the ability of the cullin-7 protein to bring together the components of this E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This leads to impaired ubiquination and hence the aggregation of damaged, misfolded, and excess proteins.

They do this by transferring some of the light energy they absorb to chlorophylls, which then uses this energy for photosynthesis. Second, they can protect plants which are over-exposed to sunlight. They do this by harmlessly dissipating excess light energy which they absorb as heat. In the absence of carotenoids, this excess light energy could destroy proteins, membranes, and other molecules. Some plant physiologists believe that carotenoids may have an additional function as regulators of certain developmental responses in plants. Tetraterpenes are synthesized from DOXP precursors in plants and some bacteria. Carotenoids involved in photosynthesis are formed in chloroplasts; Others are formed in plastids.

In addition to impacting predator-prey interactions, the production of ROS may also help an alga get an advantage in the competition for resources against other algae, be a way to prevent fouling bacteria, and act as a signaling mechanism between cells. ROS can inhibit photosynthesis in algae Thus an alga that is more tolerant of ROS than another may produce and release it as a means of decreasing the other species competitive ability. In addition, \"Chattonella marina\", the most well studied raphydophyte for ROS production, may produce a boundary of ROS that deters other marine microalgae from using nutrients in its vicinity. Similarly, this boundary could also be a way to discourage bacteria fouling, since the production of ROS is known to inhibit growth and bioluminescent ability in the bacteria \"Vibrio alginolyticus\" and \"Vibrio fischeri\", respectively. Lastly, Marshall \"et al.\" showed that \"Chattonella marina\" cells were able to change their rate of superoxide production in as little as one hour when in different cell densities, increasing the rate from 1.4 to 7.8 times the original. They suggest that this quick response in altering rates of production may be a form of chemical signaling between cells that works to provide information about cell density.",

He found that isolated chloroplasts from plants can release oxygen when they are illuminated by sunlight in the presence of a suitable electron acceptor such as ferricyanide. To demonstrate the Hill reaction in the laboratory dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) was used as the terminal electron acceptor, replacing NADP which was not available due to the extraction of the chloroplasts from the plant cellular environment. The ferrocyanide is reduced (just as NADP is when the chloroplast is in vivo) while water (HO) is oxidized into oxygen (O) and hydrogen cations during the reaction. By using this technique to observe the reaction, Hill revealed a variety of valuable facts about photosynthesis. The Hill reaction confirms that oxygen (O) is produced by a reaction that is separate from carbon dioxide (CO) fixation. The reaction in which oxygen is released requires light; therefore the Hill reaction can be described as the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis. The reaction in which oxygen is released takes place within the chloroplast of plants and the Hill reaction demonstrated that the release of oxygen (O) is only a partial reaction which requires one step of photosynthesis.",

They maintain the cells and metabolise the photosynthetic products; this process is termed kleptoplasty, and the sacoglossans are the only animals to employ it; some ciliates and foramanifera (protists) also employ the strategy. Sacoglossans have been known to survive for months living solely on the photosynthetic products of their acquired plastids. This process is somewhat mystifying, as the upkeep of chloroplasts usually requires interaction with genes encoded in the plant cell nucleus. This almost seems to suggest that the genes have been laterally transferred from algae to the animals. DNA amplification experiments on \"Elysia chlorotica\" adults and eggs using \"Vaucheria litorea\" derived primers revealed the presence of psbO, an algal nuclear gene. These results were likely an artefact, as most recent results based on transcriptomic analysis and sequencing of genomic DNA from the slug's eggs reject the hypothesis that lateral gene transfer supports kleptoplast longevity. Sacoglossans are able to choose which method of feeding they utilize. The switch from active feeding to photosynthesis in sacoglossans is triggered by the shortage of food resource, and typically not preferred. If food is readily available, the animal will actively consume. Starvation periods (periods of photosynthesis and no active feeding) vary between species of sacoglossans from less than a week to over four months, and photosynthesis is used as a last resort mechanism to avoid mortality. Another unclear step in the process is how the chloroplasts are protected from digestion, and how they adapt to their new position in animal cells without the membranes that would control their environment in the algae. However it is achieved, kleptoplasty is an important strategy for many genera of Placobranchacaea. One species of \"Elysia\" feeds on a seasonally-calcifying alga. Because it is unable to penetrate the calcified cell walls, the animal can only feed for part of the year, relying on the ingested chloroplasts to survive whilst the foodstuff is calcified, until later in the season when the calcification is lost and the grazing can continue.",
