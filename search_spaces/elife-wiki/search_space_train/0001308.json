One of the most important types of temporal pattern is circadian rhythmicity\u2014that is, rhythmicity with a period of approximately 24 hours. All animals that have been studied show circadian fluctuations in neural activity, which control circadian alternations in behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental studies dating from the 1990s have shown that circadian rhythms are generated by a \"genetic clock\" consisting of a special set of genes whose expression level rises and falls over the course of the day. Animals as diverse as insects and vertebrates share a similar genetic clock system. The circadian clock is influenced by light but continues to operate even when light levels are held constant and no other external time-of-day cues are available. The clock genes are expressed in many parts of the nervous system as well as many peripheral organs, but in mammals, all of these \"tissue clocks\" are kept in synchrony by signals that emanate from a master timekeeper in a tiny part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.",

            "document": "Drosophila circadian rhythm . In \"Drosophila\" there are two distinct groups of circadian clocks, namely the clock neurones and the clock genes. They act concertedly to produce the 24-hour cycle of rest and activity. Light is the source of activation of the clocks. The compound eyes, ocelli, and Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets (HB eyelets) are the direct external photoreceptor organs. But the circadian clock can work in constant darkness. Nonetheless, the photoreceptors are required for measuring the day length and detecting moonlight. The compound eyes are important for differentiating long days from constant light, and for the normal masking effects of light, such as inducing activity by light and inhibition by darkness. There are two distinct activity peaks termed the M (for morning) peak, happening at dawn, and E (for evening) peak, at dusk. They monitor the different day lengths in different seasons of the year. The light-sensitive proteins in the eye called, rhodopsins (rhodopsin 1 and 6), are crucial in activating the M and E oscillations. When environmental light is detected, approximately 150 neurones (there are about 100,000 neurones in the \"Drosophila\" brain) in the brain regulate the circadian rhythm. The clock neurones are located in distinct clusters in the central brain. The best-understood clock neurones are the large and small lateral ventral neurons (l-LNvs and s-LNvs) of the optic lobe. These neurones produce pigment dispersing factor (PDF), a neuropeptide that acts as a circadian neuromodulator between different clock neurones. \"Drosophila\" circadian keeps time via daily fluctuations of clock-related proteins which interact in what is called a transcription-translation feedback loop. The core clock mechanism consists of two interdependent feedback loops, namely the PER/TIM loop and the CLK/CYC loop. The CLK/CYC loop occurs during the day in which both Clock protein and cycle protein are produced. CLK/CYC heterodimer act as transcription factors and bind together to initiate the transcription of the \"per\" and \"tim\" genes by binding to a promoter element called E box, around mid-day. DNA is transcribed to produce PER mRNA and TIM mRNA. PER and TIM proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and exhibit a smooth increase in levels over the course of the day. Their RNA levels peak early in the evening and protein levels peak around daybreak. But their proteins levels are maintained at constantly low level until dusk, because during daylight also activates the \"doubletime\" (\"dbt\") gene. DBT protein induces post-translational modifications, that is phosphorylation and turnover of monomeric PER proteins. As PER is translated in the cytoplasm, it is actively phosphorylated by DBT (casein kinase 1\u03b5) and casein kinase 2 (synthesised by \"And\" and \"Tik\") as a prelude to premature degradation. The actual degradation is through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and is carried out by a ubiquitin ligase called Slimb (supernumery limbs). At the same time, TIM is itself phosphorylated by shaggy, whose activity declines after sunset. DBT gradually disappears, and withdrawal of DBT promotes PER molecules to get stabilized by physical association with TIM. Hence, maximum production of PER and TIM occurs at dusk. At the same time, CLK/CYC also directly activates \"vri\" and \"Pdp1\" (the gene for PAR domain protein 1). VRI accumulates first, 3-6 hour earlier, and start to repress \"Clk\"; but the incoming of PDP1 creates a competition by activating \"Clk\". PER/TIM dimer accumulate in the early night and translocate in an orchestrated fashion into the nucleus several hours later, and binds to CLK/CYC dimers. Bound PER completely stops the transcriptional activity of CLK and CYC.",

The laminar organization of multiple neuronal types in the cerebral cortex is required for normal cognitive function. The mouse 'reeler' mutation causes abnormal patterns of cortical neuronal migration as well as additional defects in cerebellar development and neuronal positioning in other brain regions. Reelin (RELN; 600514), the reeler gene product, is an extracellular protein secreted by pioneer neurons. The mouse 'scrambler' and 'yotari' recessive mutations exhibit a phenotype identical to that of reeler. Ware et al. (1997) determined that the scrambler phenotype arises from mutations in Dab1, a mouse gene related to the Drosophila gene 'disabled' (dab). Disabled-1 (Dab1) is an adaptor protein that is essential for the intracellular transduction of Reelin signaling, which regulates the migration and differentiation of postmitotic neurons during brain development in vertebrates. Dab1 function depends on its tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, especially Fyn. Dab encodes a phosphoprotein that binds nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and that has been implicated in neuronal development in flies. Sheldon et al. (1997) found that the yotari phenotype also results from a mutation in the Dab1 gene. Using in situ hybridization to embryonic day-13.5 mouse brain tissue, they demonstrated that Dab1 is expressed in neuronal populations exposed to reelin. The authors concluded that reelin and Dab1 function as signaling molecules that regulate cell positioning in the developing brain. Howell et al.

They found both genes as a result of a technique of forward genetics, chemically mutagenzing flies and screening for altered locomotor activity rhythms. From the screen, \"cycle\" was identified as a recessive arrhythmic mutant in one fly line because it shows arrhythmic locomotor activity patterns when a fly has 2 mutant chromosomes number 3. These mutant flies were also found to display arrhythmic eclosion. Because the mutants displayed no circadian rhythms and the heterozygote flies displayed long circadian periods, they determined that \"cycle\" has a dominant phenotype.

A comparative analysis of CpG methylation patterns between humans and primates found that there were more than 800 genes that varied in their methylation patterns among orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. Despite these apes having the same genes, methylation differences are what account for their phenotypic variation. The genes in question are involved in development. It is not the protein sequences that account for the differences in physical characteristics between humans and apes; rather, it is the epigenetic changes to the genes. Since humans and the great apes share 99% of their DNA, it is thought that the differences in methylation patterns account for their distinction. So far, there are known to be 171 genes that are uniquely methylated in humans, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in chimpanzees and bonobos, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in gorillas, and 450 genes that are uniquely methylated in orangutans. For example, genes involved in blood pressure regulation and the development of the inner ear\u2019s semicircular canal are highly methylated in humans, but not in the apes. There are also 184 genes that are conserved at the protein level between human and chimpanzees, but have epigenetic differences. Enrichments in multiple independent gene categories show that regulatory changes to these genes have given humans their specific traits. This research shows that epigenetics plays an important role in evolution in primates. It has also been shown that cis-regulatory elements changes affect the transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. 471 DNA sequences are found to be enriched or depleted in regards to histone trimethylation at the H3K4 histone in chimpanzee, human, and macaque prefrontal cortexes. Among these sequences, 33 are selectively methylated in neuronal chromatin from children and adults, but not from non-neuronal chromatin. One locus that was selectively methylated was DPP10, a regulatory sequence that showed evidence of hominid adaptation, such as higher nucleotide substitution rates and certain regulatory sequences that were missing in other primates. Epigenetic regulation of TSS chromatin has been identified as an important development in the evolution of gene expression networks in the human brain. These networks are thought to play a role in cognitive processes and neurological disorders. An analysis of methylation profiles of humans and primate sperm cells reveals epigenetic regulation plays an important role here as well. Since mammalian cells undergo reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns during germ cell development, the methylomes of human and chimp sperm can be compared to methylation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). There were many hypomethylated regions in both sperms cells and ESCs that showed structural differences. Also, many of the promoters in human and chimp sperm cells had different amounts of methylation. In essence, DNA methylation patterns differ between germ cells and somatic cells as well as between the human and chimpanzee sperm cells. Meaning, differences in promoter methylation could possible account for the phenotypic differences between humans and primates.",

Neurons that form the facial nucleus are produced in r4, but move along the anteroposterior axis of the hindbrain into r6, after which they move dorsolaterally. The vestibuloacoustic neurons are also produced in r4. However, they have a unique migration pattern, where their cell bodies cross the midline to the contralateral side.

Motor neurons produced in the hindbrain have Tbx20 selectively expressed. In Tbx20 mutations, the patterning of the regions of the rhombomeres and motor neurons were normal when they were conditional mutations and the neurons were post-mitotic.

However, hindbrain motor neurons lacking Tbx20 retained the ability to extend neurites into the periphery. The complete elimination of Tbx20 does not cause trigeminal and facial neurons to switch to hypoglossal neurons. Facial neurons have been shown to migrate tangentially from r4 to r6, while trigeminal neurons that are produced in r2 migrate dorsolaterally non-radially. Vestibuloacoustic cells migrate along the midline at r4 contralaterally in the hindbrain. Tbx20 seems to have context-dependent transcriptional activity.

First, light activates the \"cry\" gene in the clock neurones. Although CRY is produced deep inside the brain, it is sensitive to UV and blue light, and thus it easily signals the brain cells the onset of light. It irreversibly and directly binds to TIM causing it to break down through proteosome-dependent ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The CRY's photolyase homology domain is used for light detection and phototransduction, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain regulates CRY stability, CRY-TIM interaction, and circadian photosensitivity. The ubiquitination and subsequent degradation are aided by a different protein JET. Thus PER/TIM dimer dissociates, and the unbound PER becomes unstable. PER undergoes progressive phosphorylation and ultimately degradation. Absence of PER and TIM allows activation of \"clk\" and \"cyc\" genes.

Peter Hegemann, studying the light response of green algae at the University of Regensburg, had discovered photocurrents that were too fast to be explained by the classic g-protein-coupled animal rhodopsins. Teaming up with the electrophysiologist Georg Nagel at the Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt, they could demonstrate that a single gene from the alga \"Chlamydomonas\" produced large photocurents when expressed in the oocyte of a frog. To identify expressing cells, they replaced the cytoplasmic tail of the algal protein with the fluorescent protein YFP, generating the first generally applicable optogenetic tool. Zhuo-Hua Pan of Wayne State University, researching on restore sight to blindness, thought about using channelrhodopsin when it came out in late 2003. By February 2004, he was trying channelrhodopsin out in ganglion cells\u2014the neurons in our eyes that connect directly to the brain\u2014that he had cultured in a dish. Indeed, the transfected neurons became electrically active in response to light. In April 2005, Susana Lima and Miesenb\u00f6ck reported the first use of genetically-targeted P2X2 photostimulation to control the behaviour of an animal. They showed that photostimulation of genetically circumscribed groups of neurons, such as those of the dopaminergic system, elicited characteristic behavioural changes in fruit flies. In August 2005, Karl Deisseroth's laboratory in the Bioengineering Department at Stanford including graduate students Ed Boyden and Feng Zhang (both now at MIT) published the first demonstration of a single-component optogenetic system in cultured mammalian neurons, using the channelrhodopsin-2(H134R)-eYFP construct from Nagel and Hegemann. The groups of Gottschalk and Nagel were first to use channelrhodopsin-2 for controlling neuronal activity in an intact animal, showing that motor patterns in the roundworm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" could be evoked by light stimulation of genetically selected neural circuits (published in December 2005).

Lim-1 deficiency results in development of multicystic kidney, whereas, its expression can contribute to pathogenesis of nephroblastomas. Also, Lim-1 plays a role in embryonic retinal development. Lim-1 expression affects differentiation and maintenance of horizontal cells located in the retinal, thus, it could serve as a marker in studies of horizontal cell specification. Lim-1 (Lhx1) functions as a transcription factor necessary for regulating the production of coupling factors required for proper communication between the neurons located in the part of the brain responsible for regulation of circadian rhythms called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In mouse studies where Lim-1 transcription was restricted at some point during development in utero, the individual units within the subject\u2019s molecular clock functioned properly but were unable to work together. Communication of these units is required to match their release of clock proteins which begin a transcription cascade of many other proteins that produce functional responses in tissues. The cyclic pattern of these responses is due to the feedback of the clock proteins and consequent changes to this transcription cascade. Reduced Lim-1 expression leads to inadequate levels of proteins such as Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) that work to produce the neuron coordination required for a regulated circadian rhythm. The lack of such coupling factors causes the circadian clock to not function properly because the units within the SCN cannot match their release of clock proteins, and therefore their transcriptional cascades of proteins that cause changes in arousal do not align.",

            "document": "Drosophila circadian rhythm . In \"Drosophila\" there are two distinct groups of circadian clocks, namely the clock neurones and the clock genes. They act concertedly to produce the 24-hour cycle of rest and activity. Light is the source of activation of the clocks. The compound eyes, ocelli, and Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets (HB eyelets) are the direct external photoreceptor organs. But the circadian clock can work in constant darkness. Nonetheless, the photoreceptors are required for measuring the day length and detecting moonlight. The compound eyes are important for differentiating long days from constant light, and for the normal masking effects of light, such as inducing activity by light and inhibition by darkness. There are two distinct activity peaks termed the M (for morning) peak, happening at dawn, and E (for evening) peak, at dusk. They monitor the different day lengths in different seasons of the year. The light-sensitive proteins in the eye called, rhodopsins (rhodopsin 1 and 6), are crucial in activating the M and E oscillations. When environmental light is detected, approximately 150 neurones (there are about 100,000 neurones in the \"Drosophila\" brain) in the brain regulate the circadian rhythm. The clock neurones are located in distinct clusters in the central brain. The best-understood clock neurones are the large and small lateral ventral neurons (l-LNvs and s-LNvs) of the optic lobe. These neurones produce pigment dispersing factor (PDF), a neuropeptide that acts as a circadian neuromodulator between different clock neurones. \"Drosophila\" circadian keeps time via daily fluctuations of clock-related proteins which interact in what is called a transcription-translation feedback loop. The core clock mechanism consists of two interdependent feedback loops, namely the PER/TIM loop and the CLK/CYC loop. The CLK/CYC loop occurs during the day in which both Clock protein and cycle protein are produced. CLK/CYC heterodimer act as transcription factors and bind together to initiate the transcription of the \"per\" and \"tim\" genes by binding to a promoter element called E box, around mid-day. DNA is transcribed to produce PER mRNA and TIM mRNA. PER and TIM proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and exhibit a smooth increase in levels over the course of the day. Their RNA levels peak early in the evening and protein levels peak around daybreak. But their proteins levels are maintained at constantly low level until dusk, because during daylight also activates the \"doubletime\" (\"dbt\") gene. DBT protein induces post-translational modifications, that is phosphorylation and turnover of monomeric PER proteins. As PER is translated in the cytoplasm, it is actively phosphorylated by DBT (casein kinase 1\u03b5) and casein kinase 2 (synthesised by \"And\" and \"Tik\") as a prelude to premature degradation. The actual degradation is through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and is carried out by a ubiquitin ligase called Slimb (supernumery limbs). At the same time, TIM is itself phosphorylated by shaggy, whose activity declines after sunset. DBT gradually disappears, and withdrawal of DBT promotes PER molecules to get stabilized by physical association with TIM. Hence, maximum production of PER and TIM occurs at dusk. At the same time, CLK/CYC also directly activates \"vri\" and \"Pdp1\" (the gene for PAR domain protein 1). VRI accumulates first, 3-6 hour earlier, and start to repress \"Clk\"; but the incoming of PDP1 creates a competition by activating \"Clk\". PER/TIM dimer accumulate in the early night and translocate in an orchestrated fashion into the nucleus several hours later, and binds to CLK/CYC dimers. Bound PER completely stops the transcriptional activity of CLK and CYC.",

The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs consist of alternating segments called exons and introns. During the process of splicing, an RNA-protein catalytical complex known as spliceosome catalyzes two transesterification reactions, which remove an intron and release it in form of lariat structure, and then splice neighbouring exons together. In certain cases, some introns or exons can be either removed or retained in mature mRNA. This so-called alternative splicing creates series of different transcripts originating from a single gene.

Historically, exons are considered the coding sequence and introns are considered the \u201cjunk\u201d DNA. Although this has been shown to be false, it is true that exons are often merged. Depending on the needs of the cell, regulatory mechanisms choose which exons, and sometimes introns, to join together. This process of removing pieces of a pre- mRNA transcript and combining them with other pieces is called splicing. The human genome encodes approximately 25,000 genes but there are significantly more proteins produced. This is accomplished through RNA splicing. The exons of these 25,000 genes can be spliced in many different ways to create countless combinations of RNA transcripts and ultimately countless proteins. Normally, exons from the same pre-mRNA transcript are spliced together.

Exitrons are a result of alternative splicing (AS), in which introns are typically cut out of a pre mRNA sequence, while exons remain in the sequence and are translated into proteins. The same sequence within a pre mRNA strand can be considered an intron or exon depending on the desired protein to be produced. As a result, different final mRNA sequences are generated and a large variety of proteins can be made from one single gene. Mutations that exist in these sequences can also alter the way in which a sequence is spliced and as a result, change the protein produced. Splicing mutations of a mRNA sequence has been found to account for 15-60% of human genetic diseases, which suggests there may be a crucial role of exitrons in organ homeostasis.",

In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by phosphorylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and histone acetylation and deacetylation, the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. Methylation of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes \"histone acetyltransferases\" (HAT) and \"histone deacetylases\" (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.",

From the screen, \"cycle\" was identified as a recessive arrhythmic mutant in one fly line because it shows arrhythmic locomotor activity patterns when a fly has 2 mutant chromosomes number 3. These mutant flies were also found to display arrhythmic eclosion. Because the mutants displayed no circadian rhythms and the heterozygote flies displayed long circadian periods, they determined that \"cycle\" has a dominant phenotype. These data also suggest that the \"Cycle\" gene is part of the biological clock because of the similarity between the \"cycle\" mutant phenotype and that of the \"clock\" mutant. This suggests that Cycle is part of the biological clock with its phenotype similar to that of the \"clock\" mutant.

Nuclear speckles (speckles) are a part of the nuclei of cells and are enriched with splicing factors known for involvement in mRNA processing. Nuclear speckles have shown to serve neighboring active genes as storage places of these splicing factors. In this study, researchers showed that, in HeLa cells which derived from cells of a person who had cervical cancer and have proven useful for experiments, the first group of spliceosomes on pre-mRNA come from these speckles. Researchers used microinjections of spliceosome-accepting and mutant adenovirus pre-mRNAs with differential splicing factor binding to make different groups and then followed the sites in which they were heavily present. Spliceosome-accepting pre-mRNAs were rapidly targeted into the speckles, but the targeting was found to be temperature-dependent. The polypyrimidine tract sequences in mRNA promote the construction of spliceosome groups and is required for targeting, but, by itself, was not sufficient. The downstream flanking sequences were particularly important for the targeting of the mutant pre-mRNAs in the speckles. In supportive experiments, the behavior of the speckles was followed after the microinjection of antisense deoxyoligoribonucleotides (complementary sequences of DNA and or RNA to a specific sequence) and, in this case, specific sequences of snRNAs. snRNAs are known for helping in the processing of pre-mRNA as well. Under these conditions, spliceosome groups formed on endogenous pre-mRNAs. Researchers concluded that the spliceosome groups on microinjected pre-mRNA form inside the speckles. Pre-mRNA targeting and buildup in the speckles is a result of the loading of splicing factors to the pre-mRNA, and the spliceosome groups gave rise to the speckled pattern observed.",
