Amyloid beta (A\u03b2 or Abeta) denotes peptides of 36\u201343 amino acids that are crucially involved in Alzheimer's disease as the main component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer patients. The peptides derive from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved by beta secretase and gamma secretase to yield A\u03b2. A\u03b2 molecules can aggregate to form flexible soluble oligomers which may exist in several forms. It is now believed that certain misfolded oligomers (known as \"seeds\") can induce other A\u03b2 molecules to also take the misfolded oligomeric form, leading to a chain reaction akin to a prion infection. The oligomers are toxic to nerve cells. The other protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease, tau protein, also forms such prion-like misfolded oligomers, and there is some evidence that misfolded A\u03b2 can induce tau to misfold.",

In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP by one of the same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21).

The other main effect the discovery of the Swedish mutation had was to provide one transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease.

It appears that Beta amyloid (1-42) mediates its cytotoxic action by affecting key proteins that play a role in apoptosis induction. There is also evidence that shows beta amyloid proteins actually bind to cholinergic neurons and physically inhibit ChAT activity in cultures treated with oligomers of beta amyloid.

The alpha sheet has been proposed as a possible intermediate state in the conformational change in the formation of amyloid fibrils by peptides and proteins such as amyloid beta, poly-glutamine repeats, lysozyme, prion proteins, and transthyretin repeats, all of which are associated with protein misfolding disease. For example, amyloid beta is a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, and polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein are associated with Huntington's disease. These proteins undergo a conformational change from largely random coil or alpha helix structures to the highly ordered beta sheet structures found in amyloid fibrils. Most beta sheets in known proteins are \"twisted\" about 15\u00b0 for optimal hydrogen bonding and steric packing; however, some evidence from electron crystallography suggests that at least some amyloid fibrils contain \"flat\" sheets with only 1-2.5\u00b0 of twist.

In addition, applying A\u03b2 to N2K cells increases the expression of p70S6K, a downstream target of mTOR known to have higher expression in neurons that eventually develop neurofibrillary tangles. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the 7PA2 familial AD mutation also exhibit increased mTOR activity compared to controls, and the hyperactivity is blocked using a gamma-secretase inhibitor. These in vitro studies suggest that increasing A\u03b2 concentrations increases mTOR signaling; however, significantly large, cytotoxic A\u03b2 concentrations are thought to decrease mTOR signaling.",

Some evidence indicates that disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease patients allows blood plasma containing amyloid beta (A\u03b2) to enter the brain where the A\u03b2 adheres preferentially to the surface of astrocytes. These findings have led to the hypotheses that (1) breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier allows access of neuron-binding autoantibodies and soluble exogenous A\u03b242 to brain neurons and (2) binding of these autoantibodies to neurons triggers and/or facilitates the internalization and accumulation of cell surface-bound A\u03b242 in vulnerable neurons through their natural tendency to clear surface-bound autoantibodies via endocytosis. Eventually the astrocyte is overwhelmed, dies, ruptures, and disintegrates, leaving behind the insoluble A\u03b242 plaque. Thus, in some patients, Alzheimer's disease may be caused (or more likely, aggravated) by a breakdown in the blood\u2013brain barrier.",

Whilst extracellular amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), inflammation in the form of reactive astrocytes and microglia, and neuronal loss are all consistent pathological features of AD, a mechanistic link between these factors is yet to be clarified. Although the majority of past research has focused on fibrillar A\u03b2, soluble oligomeric A\u03b2 species are now considered to be of major pathological importance in AD. Up-regulation of GSH may be protective against the oxidative and neurotoxic effects of oligomeric A\u03b2.",

Considerable interest in IDE has been stimulated due to the discovery that IDE can degrade amyloid beta (A\u03b2), a peptide implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The underlying cause or causes of the disease are unclear, though the primary neuropathology observed is the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. One hypothesized mechanism of disease, called the amyloid hypothesis, suggests that the causative agent is the hydrophobic peptide A\u03b2, which forms quaternary structures that, by an unclear mechanism, cause neuronal death. A\u03b2 is a byproduct generated as the result of proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteases referred to as the \u03b2 and \u03b3 secretases. The physiological role of this processing is unclear, though it may play a role in nervous system development.",

Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39\u201343\u00a0amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (A). A is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.",

Amyloid plaques develop which result in the key symptoms of Alzheimer Disease. A\u03b2 globulomer protein is an artificial substance used in research experiments that has similar properties to A\u03b2 oligomer which is present in the body. A\u03b2 oligomer directly regulates P/Q type calcium channels. The \u03b11A subunit is the responsible for the conduction of calcium current. When only P/Q type calcium channels are present with A\u03b2 globulomer protein, there is a direct effect on the \u03b11A subunit and results in an increased calcium current through the P/Q type calcium channel. The response is dose dependent as concentrations of 20nM and 200nM of A\u03b2 globulomer are necessary for significant increase of calcium current through channel in Xenopus oocytes, showing that a certain buildup of A\u03b2 globulomer is necessary before the effects are seen. When the calcium current is increased, neurotransmitter release also rises, offering a possible cause for the toxicity in Alzheimer Disease patients.",

This ion channel hypothesis postulates that oligomers of soluble, non-fibrillar A\u03b2 form membrane ion channels allowing unregulated calcium influx into neurons. A related alternative suggests that a globular oligomer localized to dendritic processes and axons in neurons is the cytotoxic species.
