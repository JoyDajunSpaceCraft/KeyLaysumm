Behaviors showing rhythms include leaf movement, growth, germination, stomatal/gas exchange, enzyme activity, photosynthetic activity, and fragrance emission, among others. Circadian rhythms occur as a plant entrains to synchronize with the light cycle of its surrounding environment. These rhythms are endogenously generated and self-sustaining and are relatively constant over a range of ambient temperatures. Important features include two interacting transcription-translation feedback loops: proteins containing PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions; and several photoreceptors that fine-tune the clock to different light conditions. Anticipation of changes in the environment allows appropriate changes in a plant's physiological state, conferring an adaptive advantage. A better understanding of plant circadian rhythms has applications in agriculture, such as helping farmers stagger crop harvests to extend crop availability and securing against massive losses due to weather.",

The morning loop consists of CCA1 (Circadian and Clock-Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in \"Arabidopsis\", as well as PRR 7 and 9 (Pseudo-Response Regulators.) The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in regulation of flowering time genes. When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop. Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early morning, whereas TOC1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop. This finding and further computational modeling of TOC1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals.",

This gene is a member of the period family of genes. It is expressed with a daily oscillating circadian rhythm, or an oscillation that cycles with a period of approximately 24 hours. PER1 is most notably expressed in the region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the primary circadian pacemaker in the mammalian brain. PER1 is also expressed throughout mammalian peripheral tissues. Genes in this family encode components of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. Circadian expression of PER1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus will free-run in constant darkness, meaning that the 24-hour period of the cycle will persist without the aid of external light cues. Subsequently, a shift in the light/dark cycle evokes a proportional shift of gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The time of gene expression is sensitive to light, as light during a mammal's subjective night results in a sudden increase in per expression and thus a shift in phase in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Alternative splicing has been observed in this gene; however, these variants have not been fully described. There is some disagreement between experts over the occurrence of polymorphisms with functional significance. Many scientists state that there are no known polymorphisms of the human PER1 gene with significance at a population level that results in measurable behavioral or physiological changes.

After translation, the CCA1 protein needs to be phosphorylated by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2). This phosphorylation is necessary for the protein to form a homodimer and to bind to its target promoters. Hyperphosphorylation, due to the overexpression of CK2, will lead to altered circadian rhythms in the mutants where CCA1 showed shorter mRNA circadian oscillation than in wild-type plants. CK2 overexpression is significant in demonstrating CCA1 is part of the clock. The protein motif CCA1 uses to bind to its target DNA sequences is its Myb-like domain. CCA1 only has one Myb domain, whereas other plant and mammalian proteins could have multiple Myb domains. The presence of only one Myb domain in CCA1 shows its importance influence in the circadian clock. LUX is also an important Myb transcription factor that is necessary for CCA/LHY transcription. This can also help account for problems in the repressilator model described below. CCA1 is also unusual in that it has the ability to bind to asymmetric DNA sequences.

Most animals and other organisms have \"built in clocks\" in their brains that regulate the timing of biological processes and daily behavior. These \"clocks\" are known as circadian rhythms. They allow maintenance of these processes and behaviors relative to the 24-hour day/night cycle in nature. Although these rhythms are maintained by the individual organisms, their length does vary somewhat individually. Therefore, they must, either continually or repeatedly, be reset to synchronize with nature's cycle. In order to maintain synchronization (\"entrainment\") to 24 hours, external factors must play some role. The reason why entrainment occurs in humans is because each individual's circadian rhythm is longer than 24 hours (majority of population) or shorter than 24 hours (minority of population). Of the various factors that influence this entrainment, light exposure to the eyes is the strongest. Melatonin plays a large role in effects of light on circadian rhythms.

The factor that distinguishes PRR from ARR genes is the lack of a phospho-accepting aspartate site that characterizes ARR proteins. Though their research that discovered PRR genes was primarily hailed during the early 2000s as informing the scientific community about the function of TOC1 (named APRR1 by the Mizuno lab), an additional pseudo-response regulator in the \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" biological clock, the information about PRR genes that Matsushika and his team found deepened scientific understanding of circadian clocks in plants and led other researchers to hypothesize about the purpose of the PRR genes.

The conception of the plant biological clock as made up of interacting negative feedback loops is unique in comparison to mammal and fungal circadian clocks which contain autoregulatory negative feedback loops with positive and negative elements (see \"Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control on the Circadian clock page).",

            "document": "Drosophila circadian rhythm . In \"Drosophila\" there are two distinct groups of circadian clocks, namely the clock neurones and the clock genes. They act concertedly to produce the 24-hour cycle of rest and activity. Light is the source of activation of the clocks. The compound eyes, ocelli, and Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets (HB eyelets) are the direct external photoreceptor organs. But the circadian clock can work in constant darkness. Nonetheless, the photoreceptors are required for measuring the day length and detecting moonlight. The compound eyes are important for differentiating long days from constant light, and for the normal masking effects of light, such as inducing activity by light and inhibition by darkness. There are two distinct activity peaks termed the M (for morning) peak, happening at dawn, and E (for evening) peak, at dusk. They monitor the different day lengths in different seasons of the year. The light-sensitive proteins in the eye called, rhodopsins (rhodopsin 1 and 6), are crucial in activating the M and E oscillations. When environmental light is detected, approximately 150 neurones (there are about 100,000 neurones in the \"Drosophila\" brain) in the brain regulate the circadian rhythm. The clock neurones are located in distinct clusters in the central brain. The best-understood clock neurones are the large and small lateral ventral neurons (l-LNvs and s-LNvs) of the optic lobe. These neurones produce pigment dispersing factor (PDF), a neuropeptide that acts as a circadian neuromodulator between different clock neurones. \"Drosophila\" circadian keeps time via daily fluctuations of clock-related proteins which interact in what is called a transcription-translation feedback loop. The core clock mechanism consists of two interdependent feedback loops, namely the PER/TIM loop and the CLK/CYC loop. The CLK/CYC loop occurs during the day in which both Clock protein and cycle protein are produced. CLK/CYC heterodimer act as transcription factors and bind together to initiate the transcription of the \"per\" and \"tim\" genes by binding to a promoter element called E box, around mid-day. DNA is transcribed to produce PER mRNA and TIM mRNA. PER and TIM proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and exhibit a smooth increase in levels over the course of the day. Their RNA levels peak early in the evening and protein levels peak around daybreak. But their proteins levels are maintained at constantly low level until dusk, because during daylight also activates the \"doubletime\" (\"dbt\") gene. DBT protein induces post-translational modifications, that is phosphorylation and turnover of monomeric PER proteins. As PER is translated in the cytoplasm, it is actively phosphorylated by DBT (casein kinase 1\u03b5) and casein kinase 2 (synthesised by \"And\" and \"Tik\") as a prelude to premature degradation. The actual degradation is through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and is carried out by a ubiquitin ligase called Slimb (supernumery limbs). At the same time, TIM is itself phosphorylated by shaggy, whose activity declines after sunset. DBT gradually disappears, and withdrawal of DBT promotes PER molecules to get stabilized by physical association with TIM. Hence, maximum production of PER and TIM occurs at dusk. At the same time, CLK/CYC also directly activates \"vri\" and \"Pdp1\" (the gene for PAR domain protein 1). VRI accumulates first, 3-6 hour earlier, and start to repress \"Clk\"; but the incoming of PDP1 creates a competition by activating \"Clk\". PER/TIM dimer accumulate in the early night and translocate in an orchestrated fashion into the nucleus several hours later, and binds to CLK/CYC dimers. Bound PER completely stops the transcriptional activity of CLK and CYC.",

            "document": "Bacterial circadian rhythm . In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria that \"resonate\" with the environmental circadian rhythm. [6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

He and his lab have shown that an aplysia's ability to form long-term memory is dependent on the time of day, namely that aplysia are able to form long-term memories during the day, but are unable to at night. This was done via regulation of several factors, including neurotransmitter release, MAPK signaling, and immediate early gene expression. Short-term memory, however, has not been shown to vary based on time of day.

These light sensors tell the plant if it is day or night, how long the day is, how much light is available and from where the light comes. Shoots grow towards light and roots usually grow away from light. These responses are called phototropism and skototropism respectively. They are brought about by light sensitive pigments like phototropins and phytochromes and the plant hormone auxin. Many plants exhibit certain phenomena at specific times of the day; for example, certain flowers open only in the mornings. Plants keep track of the time of day with a circadian clock. This internal clock is set to solar time every day using sunlight, temperature and other cues, similar to the biological clocks of other organisms. The internal clock coupled with the ability to perceive light also allows plants to measure the time of the day and so find the season of the year. This is how many plants know when to flower. (see photoperiodism) The seeds of many plants sprout only after they are exposed to light. This response is carried out by phytochrome signalling. Plants are also able to sense the quality of light and respond appropriately. For example, in low light conditions, plants produce more photosynthetic pigments.

If normal people are deprived of external time cues (living in a cave or artificial time-isolated environment with no light), their circadian rhythms will \"free-run\" with a cycle of a little more (occasionally less) than 24 hours, expressing the intrinsic period of each individual's circadian clock. The circadian rhythms of individuals with non-24 can resemble those of experimental subjects living in a time-isolated environment, even though they are living in normal society.",

The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in regulation of flowering time genes. When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop. Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early morning, whereas TOC1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop.

The factor that distinguishes PRR from ARR genes is the lack of a phospho-accepting aspartate site that characterizes ARR proteins. Though their research that discovered PRR genes was primarily hailed during the early 2000s as informing the scientific community about the function of TOC1 (named APRR1 by the Mizuno lab), an additional pseudo-response regulator in the \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" biological clock, the information about PRR genes that Matsushika and his team found deepened scientific understanding of circadian clocks in plants and led other researchers to hypothesize about the purpose of the PRR genes.

In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria that \"resonate\" with the environmental circadian rhythm. [6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

In 1979 and a 1980, Konopka and Dominic Orr tested whether mutations in \"per\" mutations effected the period of the entire circadian cycle or just a portion of it. By comparing the light responses of \"per\" eclosion rhythm to that of wild type flies, Konopka and Orr found that light pulses reset the mutant clock to a greater extent than the wild type clock (about 10 hours for \"per\" compared to 3 hours for wild type flies). They also observed that the while duration of the light-sensitive part of the day (subjective night) was found to be similar between \"per\" and wild type flies, the duration of the light-insensitive part of the cycle (subjective day) was 5 hours shorter in mutant flies than in wild type flies. They concluded that differences in period length between mutant and wild type flies could be accounted for by a shortening of the subjective day, or the active part of the circadian cycle, in \"per\" mutants. From this, Konopka concluded that separate molecular processes correspond to the subjective night and subjective day and that the \"per\" allele acts by shortening the subjective day while leaving the subjective night unchanged. Based on these findings, Konopka and Orr constructed a model for the action of the \"per\" gene. The oscillation is interpreted in terms of a membrane gradient that is established during the subjective day and dissipates during the subjective night. The model predicts that the \"per\" gene product is active during the subjective day and functions like a pump to establish the gradient. Once a high threshold is reached, the pump shuts off and light-sensitive channels open to dissipate the gradient. A light pulse during the subjective night closes the channels and starts the pump; the value of the gradient when the channels close is the same as the value when the pump starts, and thus a reset in the cycle is produced and an oscillation results. This model has been replaced with a transcription translation negative feedback model involving \"timeless\", \"clock\", and \"cycle\".",

            "document": "Root . Gravitropism directs roots to grow downward at germination, the growth mechanism of plants that also causes the shoot to grow upward. In order to avoid shade, plants utilize a shade avoidance response. When a plant is under dense vegetation, the presence of other vegetation nearby will cause the plant to avoid lateral growth and experience an increase in upward shoot, as well as downward root growth. In order to escape shade, plants adjust their root architecture, most notably by decreasing the length and amount of lateral roots emerging from the primary root. Experimentation of mutant variants of Arabidospis thaliana found that plants sense the Red to Far Red light ratio that enters the plant through photoreceptors known as phytochromes. Nearby plant leaves will absorb red light and reflect far- red light which will cause the ratio red to far red light to lower. The phytochrome PhyA that senses this Red to Far Red light ratio is localized in both the root system as well as the shoot system of plants, but through knockout mutant experimentation, it was found that root localized PhyA does not sense the light ratio, whether directly or axially, that leads to changes in the lateral root architecture. Research instead found that shoot localized PhyA is the phytochrome responsible for causing these architectural changes of the lateral root. Research has also found that phytochrome completes these architectural changes through the manipulation of auxin distribution in the root of the plant. When a low enough Red to Far Red ratio is sensed by PhyA, the phyA in the shoot will be mostly in its active form. In this form, PhyA stabilize the transcription factor HY5 causing it to no longer be degraded as it is when phyA is in its inactive form. This stabilized transcription factor is then able to be transported to the roots of the plant through the phloem, where it proceeds to induce its own transcription as a way to amplify its signal. In the roots of the plant HY5 functions to inhibit an auxin response factor known as ARF19, a response factor responsible for the translation of PIN3 and LAX3, two well known auxin transporting proteins. Thus, through manipulation of ARF19, the level and activity of auxin transporters PIN3 and LAX3 is inhibited. Once inhibited, auxin levels will be low in areas where lateral root emergence normally occurs, resulting in a failure for the plant to have the emergence of the lateral root primordium through the root pericycle. With this complex manipulation of Auxin transport in the roots, lateral root emergence will be inhibited in the roots and the root will instead elongate downwards, promoting vertical plant growth in an attempt to avoid shade.Research of Arabidopsis has led to the discovery of how this auxin mediated root response works. In an attempt to discover the role that phytochrome plays in lateral root development, Salisbury et al. (2007) worked with \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" grown on agar plates. Salisbury et al. used wild type plants along with varying protein knockout and gene knockout Arabidopsis mutants to observe the results these mutations had on the root architecture, protein presence, and gene expression. To do this, Salisbury et al. used GFP fluorescence along with other forms of both macro and microscopic imagery to observe any changes various mutations caused. From these research, Salisbury et al. were able to theorize that shoot located phytochromes alter auxin levels in roots, controlling lateral root development and overall root architecture. In the experiments of van Gelderen et al. (2018), they wanted to see if and how it is that the shoot of \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" alters and affects root development and root architecture. To do this, they took Arabidopsis plants, grew them in agar gel, and exposed the roots and shoots to separate sources of light. From here, they altered the different wavelengths of light the shoot and root of the plants were receiving and recorded the lateral root density, amount of lateral roots, and the general architecture of the lateral roots. To identify the function of specific photoreceptors, proteins, genes, and hormones, they utilized various Arabidopsis knockout mutants and observed the resulting changes in lateral roots architecture. Through their observations and various experiments, van Gelderen et al. were able to develop a mechanism for how root detection of Red to Far-red light ratios alter lateral root development.",

Repressed in the dark by other proteins, CCA1\u2019s expression is activated when light is sensed by the phytochrome in the plant. After translation, the CCA1 protein needs to be phosphorylated by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2). This phosphorylation is necessary for the protein to form a homodimer and to bind to its target promoters. Hyperphosphorylation, due to the overexpression of CK2, will lead to altered circadian rhythms in the mutants where CCA1 showed shorter mRNA circadian oscillation than in wild-type plants. CK2 overexpression is significant in demonstrating CCA1 is part of the clock. The protein motif CCA1 uses to bind to its target DNA sequences is its Myb-like domain. CCA1 only has one Myb domain, whereas other plant and mammalian proteins could have multiple Myb domains. The presence of only one Myb domain in CCA1 shows its importance influence in the circadian clock. LUX is also an important Myb transcription factor that is necessary for CCA/LHY transcription. This can also help account for problems in the repressilator model described below. CCA1 is also unusual in that it has the ability to bind to asymmetric DNA sequences. CCA1 acts to suppress the expression of the DNA sequence it binds to. The stability of CCA1 protein is not affected by light or dark. It is regulated by its proteasome.

Although these rhythms are maintained by the individual organisms, their length does vary somewhat individually. Therefore, they must, either continually or repeatedly, be reset to synchronize with nature's cycle. In order to maintain synchronization (\"entrainment\") to 24 hours, external factors must play some role. The reason why entrainment occurs in humans is because each individual's circadian rhythm is longer than 24 hours (majority of population) or shorter than 24 hours (minority of population). Of the various factors that influence this entrainment, light exposure to the eyes is the strongest. Melatonin plays a large role in effects of light on circadian rhythms.

            "document": "Cryptochrome . Cryptochrome, like many genes involved in circadian rhythm, shows circadian cycling in mRNA and protein levels. In \"Drosophila\", \"Cry\" mRNA concentrations cycle under a light-dark cycle (LD), with high levels in light and low levels in the dark. This cycling persists in constant darkness (DD), but with decreased amplitude. The transcription of the \"Cry\" gene also cycles with a similar trend. CRY protein levels, however, cycle in a different manner than \"Cry\" transcription and mRNA levels. In LD, CRY protein has low levels in light and high levels in dark, and, in DD, CRY levels increase continuously throughout the subjective day and night. Thus, CRY expression is regulated by the clock at the transcriptional level and by light at the translational and posttranslational level.",
