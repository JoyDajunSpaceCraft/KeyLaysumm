The cytoskeleton was once thought to be a feature only of eukaryotic cells, but homologues to all the major proteins of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes.

Although the evolutionary relationships are so distant that they are not obvious from protein sequence comparisons alone, the similarity of their three-dimensional structures and similar functions in maintaining cell shape and polarity provides strong evidence that the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytoskeletons are truly homologous.

The resulting mitotic spindle is then used to propel apart the sister chromosomes into what will become the two new daughter cells. Aurora A is critical for proper formation of mitotic spindle. It is required for the recruitment of several different proteins important to the spindle formation. Among these target proteins are TACC, a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes centrosomal microtubules and Kinesin 5, a motor protein involved in the formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle. \u03b3-tubulins, the base structure from which centrosomal microtubules polymerize, are also recruited by Aurora A. Without Aurora A the centrosome does not accumulate the quantity of \u03b3-tubulin that normal centrosomes recruit prior to entering anaphase. Though the cell cycle continues even in the absence of deficient \u03b3-tubulin, the centrosome never fully matures; it organizes fewer aster microtubules than normal. Furthermore, Aurora A is necessary for the proper separation of the centrosomes after the mitotic spindle has been formed. Without Aurora A, the mitotic spindle, depending on the organism, will either never separate or will begin to separate only to collapse back onto itself. In the case of the former, it has been suggested that Aurora A cooperates with the kinase Nek2 in \"Xenopu\"s to dissolves the structure tethering the cell's centrosomes together.

            "document": "Katanin . Katanin is a microtubule-severing AAA protein. It is named after the Japanese sword, katana. Katanin is a heterodimeric protein first discovered in sea urchins. It contains a 60 kDa ATPase subunit, encoded by \"KATNA1\", which functions to sever microtubules. This subunit requires ATP and the presence of microtubules for activation. The second 80 kDA subunit, encoded by \"KATNB1\", regulates the activity of the ATPase and localizes the protein to centrosomes. Electron microscopy shows that katanin forms 14\u201316\u00a0nm rings in its active oligomerized state on the walls of microtubules. Structural analysis using electron microscopy has revealed that microtubule protofilaments change from a straight to a curved conformation upon GTP hydrolysis of \u03b2-tubulin. However, when these protofilaments are part of a polymerized microtubule, the stabilizing interactions created by the surrounding lattice lock subunits into a straight conformation, even after GTP hydrolysis. In order to disrupt these stable interactions, katanin, once bound to ATP, oligomerizes into a ring structure on the microtubule wall - in some cases oligomerization increases the affinity of katanin for microtubules and stimulates its ATPase activity. Once this structure is formed, katanin hydrolyzes ATP, and likely undergoes a conformational change that puts mechanical strain on the tubulin subunits, which destabilizes their interactions within the microtubule lattice. The predicted conformational change also likely decreases the affinity of katanin for tubulin as well as for other katanin proteins, which leads to disassembly of the katanin ring structure, and recycling of the individual inactivated proteins.  The severing of microtubules by katanin is regulated by nucleotide exchange factors, which can exchange ADP with ATP, protective microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and the p80 subunit (p60 severs microtubules much better in the presence of p80). These mechanisms have different consequences, depending on where in the cell they are activated or disrupted. For example, allowing katanin-mediated severing at the centrosome releases microtubules for free movement. In one experiment, anti-katanin antibodies were injected into a cell, causing a large accumulation of microtubules around the centrosome and inhibition of microtubule outgrowth. Therefore, katanin-mediated severing may serve to maintain organization in the cytoplasm by promoting microtubule disassembly and efficient movement. During cell division, severing at the spindle pole produces free microtubule ends and allows poleward flux of tubulin and retraction of the microtubule. Severing microtubules in the cytoplasm facilitates treadmilling and mobility, which is important during development.",

However, after 3 hours (+)-discodermolide treatment, 52% were found at G1 phase, 40% at S phase, and 58% at G2 and M phase. This result indicated that (+)-discodermolide blocks the cell cycle at G2 and M phase. This inhibition effect was also found to be reversible. Cells resume normal cycling within 48 hours after removal of (+)-discodermolide from the cell culture medium. (+)-Discodermolide arrests cell cycle via binding and stabilization of the microtubule network. Hyper-stabilization of the mitotic spindle causes cell cycle arresting at G2 and M phase and eventually leads to cell death by apoptosis. At 10\u00b5M concentration, (+)-discodermolide is able to promote microtubules assembly without microtubule-associated proteins and GTP.

Cell growth pertains to the increase in the number of cells present in an organism as it grows and develops; as the organism gets larger so too does the number of cells present. Cells are the foundation of all organisms, they are the fundamental unit of life. The growth and development of the cell are essential for the maintenance of the host, and survival of the organisms. For this process the cell goes through the steps of the cell cycle and development which involves cell growth, DNA replication, cell division, regeneration, specialization, and cell death. The cell cycle is divided into four distinct phases, G1, S, G2, and M. The G phases \u2013 which is the cell growth phase - makes up approximately 95% of the cycle. The proliferation of cells is instigated by progenitors, the cells then differentiate to become specialized, where specialized cells of the same type aggregate to form tissues, then organs and ultimately systems. The G phases along with the S phase \u2013 DNA replication, damage and repair - are considered to be the interphase portion of the cycle. While the M phase (mitosis and cytokinesis) is the cell division portion of the cycle. The cell cycle is regulated by a series of signalling factors and complexes such as CDK's, kinases, and p53. to name a few.

This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.",

Without Aurora A the centrosome does not accumulate the quantity of \u03b3-tubulin that normal centrosomes recruit prior to entering anaphase. Though the cell cycle continues even in the absence of deficient \u03b3-tubulin, the centrosome never fully matures; it organizes fewer aster microtubules than normal. Furthermore, Aurora A is necessary for the proper separation of the centrosomes after the mitotic spindle has been formed. Without Aurora A, the mitotic spindle, depending on the organism, will either never separate or will begin to separate only to collapse back onto itself. In the case of the former, it has been suggested that Aurora A cooperates with the kinase Nek2 in \"Xenopu\"s to dissolves the structure tethering the cell's centrosomes together. Therefore, without proper expression of Aurora A, the cell's centrosomes are never able to separate.",

The movement of centrosomes to opposite poles is accompanied in animal cells by the organization of individual radial microtubule arrays (asters) by each centromere. Interpolar microtubules from both centrosomes interact, joining the sets of microtubules and forming the basic structure of the mitotic spindle. In cells without centrioles chromosomes can nucleate microtubule assembly into the mitotic apparatus. In plant cells, microtubules gather at opposite poles and begin to form the spindle apparatus at locations called foci. The mitotic spindle is of great importance in the process of mitosis and will eventually segregate the sister chromatids in metaphase.",

Failure of centrosome regulation can cause mistakes in chromosome segregation and is associated with aneuploidy. A centrosome is composed of two orthogonal cylindrical proteins, called centrioles, which are surrounded by an electron dense and protein dense amorphous cloud of pericentriolar material (PCM). The PCM is essential for nucleation and organization of microtubules. The centrosome cycle is important to ensure that daughter cells receive a centrosome after cell division. As the cell cycle progresses, the centrosome undergoes a series of morphological and functional changes. Initiation of the centrosome cycle occurs early in the cell cycle, so that by the time mitosis occurs there are two centrosomes.",

Microtubules are dynamic structures, which means that they are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly. \"Vinca\" alkaloids and taxanes are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule dysfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The vinca alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule disassembly. By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). Also, these drugs can affect blood vessel growth; an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise.",

            "document": "Katanin . Katanin is a microtubule-severing AAA protein. It is named after the Japanese sword, katana. Katanin is a heterodimeric protein first discovered in sea urchins. It contains a 60 kDa ATPase subunit, encoded by \"KATNA1\", which functions to sever microtubules. This subunit requires ATP and the presence of microtubules for activation. The second 80 kDA subunit, encoded by \"KATNB1\", regulates the activity of the ATPase and localizes the protein to centrosomes. Electron microscopy shows that katanin forms 14\u201316\u00a0nm rings in its active oligomerized state on the walls of microtubules. Structural analysis using electron microscopy has revealed that microtubule protofilaments change from a straight to a curved conformation upon GTP hydrolysis of \u03b2-tubulin. However, when these protofilaments are part of a polymerized microtubule, the stabilizing interactions created by the surrounding lattice lock subunits into a straight conformation, even after GTP hydrolysis. In order to disrupt these stable interactions, katanin, once bound to ATP, oligomerizes into a ring structure on the microtubule wall - in some cases oligomerization increases the affinity of katanin for microtubules and stimulates its ATPase activity. Once this structure is formed, katanin hydrolyzes ATP, and likely undergoes a conformational change that puts mechanical strain on the tubulin subunits, which destabilizes their interactions within the microtubule lattice. The predicted conformational change also likely decreases the affinity of katanin for tubulin as well as for other katanin proteins, which leads to disassembly of the katanin ring structure, and recycling of the individual inactivated proteins.  The severing of microtubules by katanin is regulated by nucleotide exchange factors, which can exchange ADP with ATP, protective microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and the p80 subunit (p60 severs microtubules much better in the presence of p80). These mechanisms have different consequences, depending on where in the cell they are activated or disrupted. For example, allowing katanin-mediated severing at the centrosome releases microtubules for free movement. In one experiment, anti-katanin antibodies were injected into a cell, causing a large accumulation of microtubules around the centrosome and inhibition of microtubule outgrowth. Therefore, katanin-mediated severing may serve to maintain organization in the cytoplasm by promoting microtubule disassembly and efficient movement. During cell division, severing at the spindle pole produces free microtubule ends and allows poleward flux of tubulin and retraction of the microtubule. Severing microtubules in the cytoplasm facilitates treadmilling and mobility, which is important during development.",

Microtubules are long, ropelike proteins that extend through the cell and move cellular components around. Microtubules are long polymers made of smaller units (monomers) of the protein tubulin. Microtubules are created during normal cell functions by assembling (polymerizing) tubulin components, and are disassembled when they are no longer needed. One of the important functions of microtubules is to move and separate chromosomes and other components of the cell for cell division (mitosis). Mitotic inhibitors interfere with the assembly and disassembly of tubulin into microtubule polymers. This interrupts cell division, usually during the mitosis (M) phase of the cell cycle when two sets of fully formed chromosomes are supposed to separate into daughter cells.",

Another important concept for +TIP-proteins is allocating microtubule addition and dynamical regulation at mitotic kintechores. Also, they contribute in the extension of endoplasmic reticulum tubules together at expanding microtubule ends. Furthermore, +TIP-proteins aid in advocating organization of specialized microtubule array, take for example the discretely arranged bipolar microtubule bundles in fission yeast or mitotic spindles customarily.  In addition to the +TIP-proteins basic known functions, the proteins also are crucial for the linkages between microtubule ends and other cellular structure. Take for instance their ability to bind microtubule tips to the cell cortex by colliding to plasma membrane associated proteins or (by some +TIPs) straight forwardly to actin fiber. Moreover, +TIP-protein complexes in budding yeast are utilized for myosin based transport of microtubule ends.
