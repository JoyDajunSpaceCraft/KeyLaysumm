Molybdenum (Mo) is the most abundant transition element in solution in the sea (mostly as dianionic molybdate ion) and in living organisms, its abundance in the Earth\u2019s crust is quite low. Therefore, the use of Mo by living organisms seems surprising at first glance. Archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, including humans, require molybdenum. It is also found in over 50 different enzymes. Its hydrolysis to water-soluble oxo-anionic species makes Mo readily accessible. Mo is found in the active sites of metalloenzymes that perform key transformations in the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, arsenic, selenium, sulfur, and chlorine compounds. The mononuclear Mo enzymes are widely distributed in the biosphere; they catalyze many significant reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds as well as various carbonyl compounds (e.g., aldehydes, CO, and CO). Nitrate reductases enzymes are important for the nitrogen cycle. They belong to a class of enzymes with a mononuclear Mo center and they catalyze the metabolism reaction of C, N, S, etc., in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans. Due to the oxidation of sulfides, The first considerable development was that of aerobic bacteria which could now utilize Mo. As oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere and oceans, the reaction of MoS to MoO also increased. This reaction made the highly soluble molybdate ion available for incorporation into critical metalloenzymes, and may have thus allowed life to thrive. It allowed organisms to occupy new ecological niches. Mo plays an important role in the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia, which occurs in one type of nitrogenases. These enzymes are used by bacteria that usually live in a symbiotic relationship with plants; their role is nitrogen fixation, which is vital for sustaining life on earth. Mo enzymes also play important roles in sulfur metabolism of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.",

The enzyme facilitates the transport of an electron across the plasma membrane from cytosolic NADPH to extracellular oxygen (O) to produce . NADPH and FAD are bound to cytoplasmic binding sites on the enzyme. Two electrons from NADPH are transported to FAD which reduces it to FADH. Then, one electron moves to one of two heme groups in the enzyme within the plane of the membrane. The second electron pushes the first electron to the second heme group so that it can associate with the first heme group. For the transfer to occur, the second heme must be bound to extracellular oxygen which is the acceptor of the electron.

However, feeding studies with carbon isotope\u2013labeled amino acids or related molecules in pure cultures of the loline-producing fungus \"N. uncinatum\" recently demonstrated that the loline alkaloid pathway is fundamentally different from that of the plant pyrrolizidines.

These enzymes are prominently found in soil bacteria such as \"Pseudomonas\", and their reactions constitute the initial step in aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. Rieske dioxygenases are structurally more complex than other dioxygenases due to the need for an efficient electron transfer pathway (figure 2) to mediate the additional, simultaneous two-electron reduction of the aromatic substrate.  A catalytically-competent Rieske dioxygenase has three components: an NADH-dependent FAD reductase, a ferredoxin with two [2Fe-2S] Rieske clusters, and an \u03b13\u03b23 oxygenase with each \u03b1-subunit containing a mononuclear iron center and a [2Fe-2S] Rieske cluster. Within each \u03b1-subunit, the iron-sulfur cluster and mononuclear iron center are separated by a distance of some ~43 \u00c5, much too far for efficient electron transfer to occur. Instead, it is proposed electron transfer is mediated through these two centers in adjacent subunits, that the iron-sulfur cluster of one subunit transfers electrons to the mononuclear iron center of the adjacent subunit which is conveniently separated by ~12 \u00c5. While this distance would appear optimal for efficient electron transfer, replacement of the bridging aspartate residue causes a loss of enzyme function, suggesting that electron transfer instead proceeds through the hydrogen-bonding network held in place by this aspartate residue.  The mechanistic picture for this class of dioxygenases is not yet clear, but there is evidence supporting an iron(III) hydroperoxy intermediate in the reaction pathway. This species could represent the active oxidant, or it could undergo hemolytic O-O bond cleavage to yield an iron(V)-oxo intermediate as the working oxidizing agent. The Rieske dioxygenase are a powerful class of redox-active enzymes, and reactions such as sulfoxidation, desaturation, and benzylic oxidation have been reported in addition to dioxygenation. While most iron-dependent dioxygenases utilize a non-heme iron cofactor, the oxidation of L-(and D-)tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine is catalyzed by either tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which are heme dioxygenases that utilize iron coordinated by a heme B prosthetic group. While these dioxygenases are of interest in part because they uniquely use heme for catalysis, they are also of interest due to their importance in tryptophan regulation in the cell, which has numerous physiological implications. The initial association of the substrate with the dioxygen-iron in the enzyme active site is thought to either proceed via radical or electrophilic addition, requiring either ferrous iron or ferric iron, respectively. While the exact reaction mechanism for the heme-dependent dioxygenases is still under debate, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through either a dioxetane or Criegee mechanism (figures 4, 5).",

First, a molecule (that is not the molecule that is eventually fixed) attaches to the uncharged \u03b5-amino group of lysine 201 in the active site to form a carbamate. This carbamate then binds to the magnesium ion (Mg) in RuBisCO\u2019s active site. A molecule of RuBP then binds to the Mg ion. The bound RuBP then loses a proton to form a reactive, enodiolate species. The rate-limiting step of the Calvin-Benson Cycle is the addition of CO to this 2,3-enediol form of RuBP. This is the stage where the intrinsic KIE of Rubisco occurs because a new C-C bond is formed. The newly formed 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphophate molecule is then hydrated and cleaved to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PGA). 3 PGA is then converted into hexoses to be used in the photosynthetic organism\u2019s central metabolism. The isotopic substitutions that can occur in this reaction are for carbon, oxygen, and/or hydrogen, though currently only a significant isotope effect is seen for carbon isotope substitution. Isotopes are atoms that have the same number of protons but varying numbers of neutrons. \"Lighter\" isotopes (like the stable Carbon-12 isotope) have a smaller overall mass, and \"heavier\" isotopes (like the stable Carbon-13 isotope or radioactive Carbon-14 isotope) have a larger overall mass. Stable isotope geochemistry is concerned with how varying chemical and physical processes preferentially enrich or deplete stable isotopes. Enzymes like RuBisCO cause isotopic fractionation because molecules containing lighter isotopes have higher zero-point energies (ZPE), the lowest possible quantum energy state for a given molecular arrangement. For this reaction, CO has a lower ZPE than CO and sits lower in the potential energy well of the reactants (Figure 3). When enzymes catalyze chemical reactions, the lighter isotope is preferentially selected because it has a lower activation energy and is thus more energetically favorable to overcome the high potential-energy transition state and proceed through the reaction. Here, CO has a lower activation energy so more CO than CO goes through the reaction, resulting in the product (3 PGA) being lighter (Figure 3). The observed intrinsic KIEs of RuBisCO have been correlated with two aspects of its enzyme kinetics: 1) Its \"specificity\" for CO over O, and 2) Its rate of carboxylation.",

Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous triads.

Like any other protein an enzyme is an amino acid polymer with added cofactors and other post-translational modifications. Often most of the amino acid polymer is indirectly involved with the enzymes function, perhaps providing ancillary structure or connectivity, indirect activity regulation, or molecular identification of the enzyme. As a result, most enzymes are large molecules weighing many kilodaltons. This bulk can obscure various investigative techniques such as NMR, EPR, electrochemistry, crystallography, among others. It is standard practice to compare spectroscopic data from enzymes to similar spectroscopic data derived from better characterized small molecules. In this way the understanding of metalloenzymes and other metalloproteins have developed. In many cases the small molecule analogs were created for other reasons; however, it has been increasingly common for groups to intentionally make small molecule analogs also known as enzyme mimics. These enzyme mimics are prime examples of bioinorganic chemistry.",

Vanadium nitrogenase is a key enzyme for nitrogen fixation found in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and is used as an alternative to molybdenum nitrogenase when molybdenum is unavailable. Vanadium nitrogenases are an important biological use of vanadium, which is uncommonly used by life. An important component of the nitrogen cycle, vanadium nitrogenase converts nitrogen gas to ammonia, thereby making otherwise inaccessible nitrogen available to plants. Unlike molybdenum nitrogenase, vanadium nitrogenase can also reduce carbon monoxide to ethylene, ethane and propane but both enzymes can reduce protons to hydrogen gas and acetylene to ethylene.  Vanadium nitrogenases are found in members of the bacterial genus \"Azotobacter\" as well as the species \"Rhodopseudomonas palustris\" and \"Anabaena variabilis\". Most of the functions of vanadium nitrogenase match those of the more common molybdenum nitrogenases and serve as an alternative pathway for nitrogen fixation in molybdenum deficient conditions. Like molybdenum nitrogenase, dihydrogen functions as a competitive inhibitor and carbon monoxide functions as a non-competitive inhibitor of nitrogen fixation. Vanadium nitrogenase has an \u03b1\u03b2\u038e subunit structure while molybdenum nitrogenase has an \u03b1\u03b2 structure. Though the structural genes encoding vanadium nitrogenase show only about 15% conservation with molybdenum nitrogenases, the two nitrogenases share the same type of redox centers. At room temperature, vanadium nitrogenase is less efficient at fixing nitrogen than moldybdenum nitrogenases because it converts more H to H as a side reaction. However, at low temperatures vanadium nitrogenases have been found to be more active than the molybdenum type, and at temperatures as low as 5\u00a0\u00b0C its nitrogen-fixing activity is 10 times higher than that of molybdenum nitrogenase. Like molybdenum nitrogenase, vanadium nitrogenase is easily oxidized and is thus only active under anaerobic conditions. Various bacteria employ complex protection mechanisms to avoid oxygen.",

Dnr S, daunosamine glycosyltransferase catalyzes the addition of the TDP activated glycoside, L-daunosamine-TDP to \u03b5-rhodomycinone to give rhodomycin D (Figure 2). The release of TDP drives the reaction forward. The enzyme has sequence similarity to glycosyltransferases of the other \"unusual sugars\" added to Type II PKS aromatic products. Dnr P, rhodomycin D methylesterase, removes the methyl group added previously by DnrC. It initially served to activate the adjacent methylene bridge, and after that it prevented its carboxyl group from leaving the C-10 carbon (see Fig 2). Had the carboxyl group not been esterified prior to the fourth ring cyclization, its departure as [ CO2 would have been favored by the formation of a bicyclic aromatic system. After C-7 reduction and glycosylation, the C-8 methylene bridge is no longer activated for deprotonation, thereby making aromatization less likely. Note that the non-isolable intermediate, with numbering, is the 3rd molecule in Figure 2. The numbering system is very odd and a vestige of early nomenclature. The decarboxylation of the intermediate occurs spontaneously, or by the influence of Dnr P, giving 13-deoxycarminomycin. A crystal structure, with bound products, of aclacinomycin methylesterase, an [enzyme] with 53% sequence homology to Dnr P, from \"streptomyces purpurascens\", has been solved. It is able to catalyze the same reaction and uses a classic Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad with serine acting as the nucleophile and gly-met providing stabilization of the transition state by forming an \"oxyanion hole\". The active site amino acids are almost entirely the same as Dnr P, and the mechanism is almost certainly identical. Although Dox A is shown next in the biosynthetic scheme (Figure 2), Dnr K, carminomycin 4-O-methyltransferase is able to O-methylate the 4-hydroxyl group of any of the glycosides in Figure 2. A 2.35 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the enzyme with bound products has recently been solved. The orientation of the products is consistent with a SN2 mechanism of methyl transfer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the potential acid/base residues in the active site did not affect catalysis leading to the conclusion that Dnr K most likely acts as an entropic enzyme in that rate enhancement is mainly due to orientational and proximity effects. This is in contrast to most other O-methyltransferases where acid/base catalysis has been demonstrated to be an essential contribution to rate enhancement. Dox A catalyzes three successive oxidations in \"streptomyces peucetius\". Deficient DXR production is not primarily due to low levels of or malfunctioning Dox A, but because there are many products diverted away from the pathway shown in Figure 2. Each of the glycosides is a potential target of shunt enzymes, not shown, some of which are products of the dnr gene cluster. Mutations of these enzymes does significantly boost DXR production. In addition, Dox A has a very low kcat/Km value for C-14 oxidation (130/M) compared to C-13 oxidation (up to 22,000/M for some substrates). Genetic manipulation to overexpress Dox A has also increased yields, particularly if the genes for the shunt enzymes are inactivated simultaneously. Dox A is a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase that has broad substrate specificity, catalyzing anthracycline hydroxylation at C-13 and C-14 ( Figure 2). The enzyme has an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen and NADPH. Initially, two successive oxidations are done at C-13, followed by a single oxidation of C-14 that converts daunorubicin to doxorubicin.",

The \"E. coli\" active site contains the same residues with the exception of these noted exchanges: Asp48 for Asn194, Gln88 for Glu248, and Ser84 for Thr242. In the enzyme active site, interactions between these specific residues and the substrate restrict conformational degrees of freedom, such that the entropy of activation is effectively reduced to zero, and thereby promotes catalysis. As a result, there is no formal intermediate, but rather a pseudo-diaxial chair-like [[transition state]]. Evidence for this conformation is provided by an inverse secondary [[kinetic isotope effect]] at the carbon directly attached to the hydroxyl group. This seemingly unfavorable arrangement is achieved through a series of electrostatic interactions, which rotate the extended chain of chorismate into the conformation required for this concerted mechanism.

Not only does this stabilize the complex, but disruption of resonance within the vinyl ether destabilizes the ground state and reduces the energy barrier for this transformation. An alternative view is that electrostatic stabilization of the polarized transition state is of great importance in this reaction. In the chorismate mutase active site, the transition-state analog is stabilized by 12 electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. This is shown in mutants of the native enzyme in which Arg90 is replaced with [[citrulline]] to demonstrate the importance of hydrogen bonding to stabilize the transition state.

Two-metal ion mechanism is one of the possible catalytic mechanisms of BamHI since the BamHI crystal structure has the ability to bind two metal ions at the active site, which is suitable for the classical two-metal ion mechanism to proceed. Two-metal ion mechanism is the use of two metal ions to catalyze the cleavage reaction of restriction enzyme. BamHI has three critical active site residues that are important for metal catalyst. They are known as Asp94, Glu111 and Glu113. These residues are usually acidic. In the presence of a metal ion, the residues are pointed toward the metal ion. In the absence of metal ions, the residues are pointed outward. The two metal ions (A and B) are 4.1 apart from each other in the active site and are in-line with these residues. In general, when the two metal ions (A and B) are bonded to the active site, they help stabilize a cluster distribution of negative charges localized at the active site created by the leaving of an oxygen atom during the transition state. First, a water molecule will be activated by metal ion A at the active site.

Most mononculear iron dioxygenases are members of the cupin superfamily in which the overall domain structure is described as a six-stranded \u03b2-barrel fold (or jelly roll motif). At the center this barrel structure is a metal ion, most commonly ferrous iron, whose coordination environment is frequently provided by residues in two partially conserved structural motifs: G(X)HXH(X)-E(X)G and G(X)-PXG(X)H(X)N. Two important groups of mononuclear, non-heme iron dioxygenases are catechol dioxygenases and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenases. The catechol dioxygenases, some of the most well-studied dioxygenase enzymes, use dioxygen to cleave a carbon-carbon bond of an aromatic catechol ring system. Catechol dioxygenases are further classified as being \u201cextradiol\u201d or \u201cintradiol,\u201d and this distinction is based on mechanistic differences in the reactions (figures 1 & 2). Intradiol enzymes cleave the carbon-carbon bond between the two hydroxyl groups. The active ferric center is coordinated by four protein ligands\u2014two histidine and two tyrosinate residues\u2014in a trigonal bipyramidal manner with a water molecule occupying the fifth coordination site.

This then allows for reaction with dioxygen and subsequent intradiol cleavage to occur through a cyclic anhydride intermediate. Extradiol members utilize ferrous iron as the active redox state, and this center is commonly coordinated octahedrally through a 2-His-1-Glu motif with labile water ligands occupying empty positions. Once a substrate binds to the ferrous center, this promotes dioxygen binding and subsequent activation. This activated oxygen species then proceeds to react with the substrate ultimately cleaving the carbon-carbon bond adjacent to the hydroxyl groups through the formation of an \u03b1-keto lactone intermediate.",

This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.) In addition, the small size of the Li and O ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidising agents. Sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers; the presence of water vapour, naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient. All the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides (MO) through low-temperature reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone: the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia. They slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen, and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water.

Whereas most fuel cells use metals like platinum and nickel as catalysts, the enzymatic biofuel cell uses enzymes derived from living cells (although not within living cells; fuel cells that use whole cells to catalyze fuel are called microbial fuel cells). This offers a couple of advantages for enzymatic biofuel cells: Enzymes are relatively easy to mass-produce and so benefit from economies of scale, whereas precious metals must be mined and so have an inelastic supply. Enzymes are also specifically designed to process organic compounds such as sugars and alcohols, which are extremely common in nature.

First, a molecule (that is not the molecule that is eventually fixed) attaches to the uncharged \u03b5-amino group of lysine 201 in the active site to form a carbamate. This carbamate then binds to the magnesium ion (Mg) in RuBisCO\u2019s active site. A molecule of RuBP then binds to the Mg ion. The bound RuBP then loses a proton to form a reactive, enodiolate species. The rate-limiting step of the Calvin-Benson Cycle is the addition of CO to this 2,3-enediol form of RuBP. This is the stage where the intrinsic KIE of Rubisco occurs because a new C-C bond is formed. The newly formed 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphophate molecule is then hydrated and cleaved to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PGA). 3 PGA is then converted into hexoses to be used in the photosynthetic organism\u2019s central metabolism. The isotopic substitutions that can occur in this reaction are for carbon, oxygen, and/or hydrogen, though currently only a significant isotope effect is seen for carbon isotope substitution. Isotopes are atoms that have the same number of protons but varying numbers of neutrons. \"Lighter\" isotopes (like the stable Carbon-12 isotope) have a smaller overall mass, and \"heavier\" isotopes (like the stable Carbon-13 isotope or radioactive Carbon-14 isotope) have a larger overall mass. Stable isotope geochemistry is concerned with how varying chemical and physical processes preferentially enrich or deplete stable isotopes. Enzymes like RuBisCO cause isotopic fractionation because molecules containing lighter isotopes have higher zero-point energies (ZPE), the lowest possible quantum energy state for a given molecular arrangement. For this reaction, CO has a lower ZPE than CO and sits lower in the potential energy well of the reactants (Figure 3). When enzymes catalyze chemical reactions, the lighter isotope is preferentially selected because it has a lower activation energy and is thus more energetically favorable to overcome the high potential-energy transition state and proceed through the reaction. Here, CO has a lower activation energy so more CO than CO goes through the reaction, resulting in the product (3 PGA) being lighter (Figure 3). The observed intrinsic KIEs of RuBisCO have been correlated with two aspects of its enzyme kinetics: 1) Its \"specificity\" for CO over O, and 2) Its rate of carboxylation.",

The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD and quinone are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase.

The method depends on the details of carbon metabolism in our bodies. When cellular respiration breaks down carbon-containing molecules to release energy, carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct. Carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms and only one carbon atom, but food molecules such as carbohydrates do not contain enough oxygen to provide both oxygen atoms found in CO. It turns out, one of the two oxygen atoms in CO is derived from body water. If the oxygen in water is labeled with O, then CO produced by respiration will contain labeled oxygen. In addition, as CO travels from the site of respiration through the cytoplasm of a cell, through the interstitial fluids, into the bloodstream and then to the lungs some of it is reversibly converted to bicarbonate. So, after consuming water labeled with O, the O equilibrates with the body's bicarbonate and dissolved carbon dioxide pool (through the action of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase). As carbon dioxide is exhaled, O is lost from the body. This was discovered by Lifson in 1949. However, O is also lost through body water loss (such as urine and evaporation of fluids). However, deuterium (the second label in the doubly labeled water) is lost \"only\" when body water is lost. Thus the loss of deuterium in body water over time can be used to mathematically compensate for the loss of O by the water-loss route. This leaves only the remaining net loss of O in carbon dioxide. This measurement of the amount of carbon dioxide lost is an excellent estimate for total carbon dioxide production. Once this is known, the total metabolic rate may be estimated from simplifying assumptions regarding the ratio of oxygen used in metabolism (and therefore heat generated), to carbon dioxide eliminated (see respiratory quotient). This quotient can be measured in other ways, and almost always has a value between 0.7 and 1.0, and for a mixed diet is usually about 0.8.",
