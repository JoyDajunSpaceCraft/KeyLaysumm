However, all non-avian dinosaurs as well as many groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66\u00a0million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass extinction event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered no discernible population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.",

However, new fossils found in 2007 and 2008 showed that the \"chain mail\" of tommotiids formed the tube of a sessile animal; one tommotiid resembled phoronids, which are close relatives or a subgroup of brachiopods, while the other tommotiid bore two symmetrical plates that might be an early form of brachiopod valves. Lineages of brachiopods that have both fossil and extant taxa appeared in the early Cambrian, Ordovician, and Carboniferous periods, respectively. Other lineages have arisen and then become extinct, sometimes during severe mass extinctions. At their peak in the Paleozoic era, the brachiopods were among the most abundant filter-feeders and reef-builders, and occupied other ecological niches, including swimming in the jet-propulsion style of scallops. Brachiopod fossils have been useful indicators of climate changes during the Paleozoic. However, after the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, brachiopods recovered only a third of their former diversity. A study in 2007 concluded the brachiopods were especially vulnerable to the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction, as they built calcareous hard parts (made of calcium carbonate) and had low metabolic rates and weak respiratory systems. It was often thought that brachiopods went into decline after the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction, and were out-competed by bivalves, but a study in 1980 found both brachiopod and bivalve species increased from the Paleozoic to modern times, with bivalves increasing faster; after the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction, brachiopods became for the first time less diverse than bivalves.",

The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event.

In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by drought near a diminishing watering hole; scavenging traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of calves and large diversity of other animal species found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown.

Currie believed \"Tyrannosaurus\" to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as \"Triceratops\" and \"Ankylosaurus\", were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for \"Tyrannosaurus\" to hunt in groups.

The cladogram below shows the position of \"Thylacosmilus\" within Sparassodonta, according to Suarez and colleagues, 2015. \"Thylacosmilus\" had large, saber-like canines. The roots of these canines grew throughout the animal's life, growing in an arc up the maxilla and above the orbits. Although the postcranial remains of \" Thylacosmilus \" are incomplete, the elements recovered so far allow to examine the characteristics that this animal acquired in convergence with the sabertooth felids. Its cervical vertebrae were very strong and to some extent resembled the vertebrae of Machairodontinae.; also the cervical vertebrae have neural apophysis well developed, along with ventral apophysis in some cervicals, an element that is characteristic of other borhyaenoids. The lumbar vertebrae are short and more rigid than in \"Prothylacynus\". The bones of the limbs, like the humerus and femur are very robust, since they probably have to deal with larger forces than in the modern felids. In particular, the features of the humerus suggest a great development of the pectoral and deltoid muscles, not only required to capture its preys, also to absorb the energy of the impact of the collision with such preys. The features of the hindlimb, with a robust femur equipped with a great trochanter in the lower part, the short tibia and plantigrade feet shows that this animal was not a runner, and probably stalked its prey items. The hindlimbs also allowed certain mobility of the hip, and possibily the ability to stand up only with its hindlimbs, like \"Prothylacynus\" and \"Borhyaena\". Contrary to felids, barbourofelids and nimravids, the claws of \"Thylacosmilus\" were not retractable. Body mass for sparassodonts are difficult to estimate, since that these animals have relatively large heads in proportion with their bodies which generates overestimations, particularly when is compared only with skulls of modern members of Carnivora, which have different locomotory and functional adaptations, or the recent predatory marsupials, which doesn't exceed the 30\u00a0kg of body mass. The methods used or are based of \"Thylacosmilus\" based, like the study by Ercoli and Prevosti (2011) using linear regression equations with postcranial elements like tibiae, humeri and ulnae that supports directly the body weight, from both extinct and modern members of carnivorans and metatherians suggests that this animal weighed between , and one estimate suggesting up to , about the same size as a modern jaguar. The differences in weight estimations possibly are due the individual size variation of the specimens studied in each analysis, as well as the different samples and methods used; in any case, the weight estimations are consistent for generalist terrestrial species or with certain degree of cursoriality. This mass would make it one of the largest known carnivorous metatherians.",

By in the Early Jurassic there were animals that were very like today's mammals in a number of respects. Unfortunately, there is a gap in the fossil record throughout the Middle Jurassic. However, fossil teeth discovered in Madagascar indicate that the split between the lineage leading to monotremes and the one leading to other living mammals had occurred by . After dominating land vertebrate niches for about 150 Ma, the non-avian dinosaurs perished in the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event () along with many other groups of organisms. Mammals throughout the time of the dinosaurs had been restricted to a narrow range of taxa, sizes and shapes, but increased rapidly in size and diversity after the extinction, with bats taking to the air within 13\u00a0million years, and cetaceans to the sea within 15\u00a0million years. The first flowering plants appeared around 130 Ma. The 250,000 to 400,000 species of flowering plants outnumber all other ground plants combined, and are the dominant vegetation in most terrestrial ecosystems. There is fossil evidence that flowering plants diversified rapidly in the Early Cretaceous, from , and that their rise was associated with that of pollinating insects. Among modern flowering plants \"Magnolia\" are thought to be close to the common ancestor of the group. However, paleontologists have not succeeded in identifying the earliest stages in the evolution of flowering plants. The social insects are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile. This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as natural selection and the selfish gene. In fact, there are very few eusocial insect species: only 15 out of approximately 2,600 living families of insects contain eusocial species, and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among arthropods, although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families. Nevertheless, social insects have been spectacularly successful; for example although ants and termites account for only about 2% of known insect species, they form over 50% of the total mass of insects. Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success.",

Langston placed both in the family Eothyrididae. Since 1980, most phylogenetic analyses place eothyridids in a clade or evolutionary grouping called Caseasauria, which also includes a family of mostly herbivorous Early Permian synapsids called Caseidae. The majority of analyses place Caseasauria as the basal-most clade within Synapsida. With caseids and eothyridids are equally closely related to the last common ancestor of synapsids, the body plan of \"Oedaleops\" and other eothyridids (characterized by large heads and relatively narrow bodies) more closely approximates what is predicted for the synapsid common ancestor than does the body plan of caseids (characterized by extremely small heads and barrel-shaped bodies). Therefore, \"Oedaleops\" is one of the most important taxa in phylogenetic analyses and the features of its skeleton have an important bearing on the relationships of other synapsids. Below is a cladogram from the phylogenetic analysis of Sumida \"et al.\" (2013) that shows many of the same relationships as those found in previous analyses, except for having \"Eothyris\" being more closely related to caseids than to \"Oedaleops\" (making Eothyrididae paraphyletic):",

Many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered. \"Ichthyostega\" was one of the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils and more efficient lungs. It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish, \"Eusthenopteron\". Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods. Their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger, better able to support the weight of their bodies on land. They developed \"hands\" and \"feet\" with five or more digits; the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation. The fish's hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear, an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land. An affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi-folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra-occipital bones at the back of the head, neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom. At the end of the Devonian period (360 million years ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as \"Ichthyostega\", may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal. In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.",

Basal borhyaenoids are last known from the early late Miocene (\"Pseudolycopsis cabrerai\" and \"Lycopsis viverensis\"), and after this time were at least partially replaced by large-bodied basal sparassodonts such as \"Stylocynus\". It has been suggested that this shift in dominance was due to the more omnivorous habits of basal sparassodonts, which may have been better able to exploit the more seasonal climates of South America during the late Neogene. Borhyaenids are last known from the latest Miocene, though only fragmentary remains of this group are known from this period. Later remains assigned to this group have since been reidentified as thylacosmilids or procyonids. By the Pliocene, only two families of sparassodonts remained in South America, the Hathliacynidae and the Thylacosmilidae. Pliocene hathliacynid remains are rare, and it is possible that these animals may have competed with the large carnivorous didelphids such as \"Lutreolina\" that appeared around this time. Hathliacynids are last definitively known from the early Pliocene, though it has been suggested that the genus \"Borhyaenidium\" may have survived into the late Pliocene. The thylacosmilids, on the other hand, were more successful and abundant, being some of the only large mammalian carnivores in South America during the Pliocene, and only died out at the end of the epoch. It is still not certain why Sparassodonta declined in diversity and became extinct during the late Cenozoic, but it appears as though competition from eutherian carnivorans was not a factor, as the placental analogues of sparassodonts (dogs, weasels, and saber-toothed cats) did not enter South America until the middle Pleistocene, several million years after their sparassodont counterparts became extinct. The overall decline in sparassodont diversity from the late Miocene to the end of the Pliocene may be linked to the cooling climates following the middle Miocene climatic optimum and the onset of the Pleistocene ice ages.",

Details of the morphology of \"Tomistoma\" and \"Gavialis\" suggest that the two are only distantly related and that long snouts evolved independently in each lineage as a result of convergent evolution. Morphologically, tomistomines seem to be more closely related to crocodylids, having shared a more recent common ancestor with crocodiles than with the gharial.

Like those of other sauropods, the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The vertebral formula for the holotype of \"A.louisae\" is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of \"Apatosaurus\" and \"Brontosaurus\" are stouter and more robust than those of other diplodocids and were found to be most similar to \"Camarasaurus\" by Charles Whitney Gilmore. In addition, they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In \"Apatosaurus louisae\", the atlas-axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. \"Apatosaurus\" has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. \"Apatosaurus\", like its close relative \"Supersaurus\", has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. \"Apatosaurus\" also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end. The limb bones are also very robust. Within Apatosaurinae, the scapula of \"Apatosaurus louisae\" is intermediate in morphology between those of \"A.ajax\" and \"Brontosaurus excelsus\". The arm bones are stout, so the humerus of \"Apatosaurus\" resembles that of \"Camarasaurus\", as well as \"Brontosaurus\". However, the humeri of \"Brontosaurus\" and \"A.ajax\" are more similar to each other than they are to \"A.louisae\". In 1936 Charles Gilmore noted that previous reconstructions of \"Apatosaurus\" forelimbs erroneously proposed that the radius and ulna could cross; in life they would have remained parallel. \"Apatosaurus\" had a single large claw on each forelimb, a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than \"Shunosaurus\". The first three toes had claws on each hindlimb. The phalangeal formula is 2-1-1-1-1, meaning the innermost finger (phalanx) on the forelimb has two bones and the next has one. The single manual claw bone (ungual) is slightly curved and squarely truncated on the anterior end. The pelvic girdle includes the robust ilia, and the fused (co-ossified) pubes and ischia. The femora of \"Apatosaurus\" are very stout and represent some of the most robust femora of any member of Sauropoda. The tibia and fibula bones are different from the slender bones of \"Diplodocus\" but are nearly indistinguishable from those of \"Camarasaurus\". The fibula is longer and slenderer than the tibia.

The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication. Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.",

            "document": "Plesiosuchus . The type and referred specimens of \"Plesiosuchus\" were discovered by John Clavell Mansel-Pleydell in the 1860s alongside the remains of several other large-bodied marine reptiles along the coast of Dorset. Mansel-Pleydell gave these remains to the British Museum (now in the Natural History Museum) in 1866. Part of the holotype of \"P. manselii\" (NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103a) was first described by John Hulke in 1869. He referred it to \"Steneosaurus rostro-minor\" Geoffroy (1825), alongside \"Dakosaurus maximus\" and other specimens. Initially, the skull (NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103) was believed to be pliosaurian; it was the preparator Mr Davies that suggested a crocodylian nature for the skull. In 1870, Hulke described the skull, which is preserved in two sections: the rostrum and the occiput. Hulke suggested that \"this head and the lower jaw both belonged to one individual\" as both the same dimensions and were discovered in close proximity in a reef exposed at low water in Kimmeridge Bay. Some material was destroyed due to pyrite decay while the isolated bone fragment referred to as the \"upper maxilla\" has never been figured and cannot be located. Richard Owen erected the genus \"Plesiosuchus\" for \"S. manselii\" in 1884 as he considered it to be more similar morphologically to extant crocodylians than to \"Steneosaurus\". Woodward (1885) referred the species to the genus \"Dakosaurus\". Lydekker (1888) synonymized \"P. manselii\" with \"Dakosaurus maximus\" while Fraas (1902) regarded the two species to be synonymous or closely related. Phylogenetic analyses of Young & Andrade (2009), Cau & Fanti (2011) and Young \"et al.\" (2011) support the hypothesis that the two are separate species of \"Dakosaurus\". Young \"et al.\" (2012) resurrected the genus name \"Plesiosuchus\" as their phylogenetic analysis found a paraphyletic \"Dakosaurus\" and suggested more basal position for \"P. manselii\" within Geosaurini than previously thought. The holotype of \"Plesiosuchus\" includes, NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103, a broken and incomplete skull with a mandible and isolated postcranial remains (NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103a). The incomplete skull includes the snout and the occiput, lacking the occipital condyle, with fragments of the supratemporal arches and isolated right articular. NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103a includes the right mandibular ramus, some isolated teeth, a humerus, and numerous ribs and vertebrae that are partially or completely imbedded in matrix. Two further specimens may belong to the holotype: NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40104 - an occipital condyle, and NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40105 \u2013 carpal and tarsal bones. Both specimens were donated to the University of Toronto through Professor Ramsay Wright in 1900. From examining the register in the NHMUK Earth Sciences Department, it is possible both specimens were part of NHMUK PV OR40103, although neither specimen could be located at the Royal Ontario Museum. The holotype of \"Plesiosuchus\" represents a large individual. Although it is uncertain whether the holotype (and referred specimens) belong to adults or subadults as none of the vertebrae are well enough preserved to determine the nature of the neurocentral sutures, its total body length is estimated to be . It was collected from the late Kimmeridgian (\"Aulacostephanus autissiodorensis\" Sub-Boreal ammonite Zone) Lower Kimmeridge Clay Formation of Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset. The specimen NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103b, a short series of cervicodorsal vertebrae preserved in matrix, is also a thalattosuchian due to its possession of several apomorphies of the group. However, it does not belong to the same individual as the holotype as the vertebrae are much smaller than those of NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103a, and the matrix is of a different composition. It is unclear whether it belongs to \"Plesiosuchus\" or another metriorhynchid, and therefore it is considered to be Thalattosuchia indeterminate.",

Fossils have been found from the eastern United States in deposits that are between late Oligocene and Middle Pleistocene in age. The type species is \"T. antiqua\".

More recently erected species were reassigned from other tomistomine genera, although their assignment to \"Thecachampsa\" has since been questioned. The holotype of \"T. antiqua\" is an isolated tooth of little diagnostic value, making the assignment of any other body parts to the genus, including skulls and vertebrae, questionable.",
