As first noted by Harold Flor in his mid-20th century formulation of the gene-for-gene relationship, a plant R gene has specificity for a pathogen avirulence gene (Avr gene). Avirulence genes are now known to encode effectors. The pathogen Avr gene must have matched specificity with the R gene for that R gene to confer resistance, suggesting a receptor/ligand interaction for Avr and R genes. Alternatively, an effector can modify its host cellular target (or a molecular decoy of that target), and the R gene product (NLR protein) activates defenses when it detects the modified form of the host target or decoy.",

The systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a \"whole-plant\" resistance response that occurs following an earlier localized exposure to a pathogen. SAR is analogous to the innate immune system found in animals, and there is evidence that SAR in plants and innate immunity in animals may be evolutionarily conserved. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in \"Arabidopsis\" (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. SAR is important for plants to resist disease, as well as to recover from disease once formed. SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called \"broad spectrum\". SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or \"pathogenesis-related\" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA). The pathogen-induced SA signal activates a molecular signal transduction pathway that is identified by a gene called \"NIM1\", \"NPR1\" or \"SAI1\" (three names for the same gene) in the model genetic system \"Arabidopsis thaliana\". SAR has been observed in a wide range of flowering plants, including dicotyledon and monocotyledon species.

CaMs, CMLs and CaM-binding proteins are some of the recently identified elements of the plant defense signaling pathways. Several CML genes in tobacco, bean and tomato are responsive to pathogens.

The CML9 expression in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is rapidly induced by phytopathogenic bacteria, flagellin and salicylic acid. Expression of soybean SCaM4 and SCaM5 in transgenic \"tobacco\" and \"Arabidopsis\" causes an activation of genes related to pathogen resistance and also results in enhanced resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogen infection.

Studies to determine the evolutionary origins of vertebrates have led to understanding the development of immune system processes and furthermore answer the questions of how and why pathogens have learned to evade and shut down these selectable genetic traits. Eight functional and four pseudo IRG genes have been identified in the invertebrate \"Branchiostoma floridiae\". Li et al. determined expression patterns of functional IFN-inducible GTPase genes in \"Branchiostoma japonicum\" at various immunologic sites when induced by pathogens and pathogenic substances. This evidence suggests that IRGs may function in an immune-related capacity in cephalochordates. The paradox remains that these IRGs function without induction by IFN activation pathways, since \"B. japonicum\" and other amphioxus species do not possess IFN and IFN receptor genes. It is possible that IRGs may have existed prior to the Cambrian Explosion as an innate immune mechanism and with the evolution of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates, IFN evolved to modulate IRG function. Vertebrates have evolved an array of IRG genes as a whole, potentially due to the evolution between variable pathogen interactions. The C57BL/6 mouse has 23 IRG genes of which 21 may be functional in resistance to pathogens (6 are well characterized), whereas humans have evolved only 1 functional IRG gene (IRGM) and one pseudogene. Studies in mice have characterized the importance of the type 2 effector molecule IFN\u03b3 in various cell types and gone on to determine the importance of these proteins in intracellular pathogen resistance.",

Plants perceive flagellin when it binds to the receptor FLS2. When flagellin is perceived by FLS2, this strongly promotes the interaction between FLS2 and BAK1 and this then leads to changes in gene expression that promote defense against bacteria.",

A well studied example of this are the transcription-activator like effectors (TAL effectors) secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria. When injected into plants, these proteins can enter the nucleus of the plant cell, bind plant promoter sequences, and activate transcription of plant genes that aid in bacterial infection. TAL effectors contain a central repeat region in which there is a simple relationship between the identity of two critical residues in sequential repeats and sequential DNA bases in the TAL effector\u2019s target site. This property likely makes it easier for these proteins to evolve in order to better compete with the defense mechanisms of the host cell.",

Field trials demonstrated robust resistance without bactericidal chemicals.
