Brain morphometry is a subfield of both morphometry and the brain sciences, concerned with the measurement of brain structures and changes thereof during development, aging, learning, disease and evolution. Since autopsy-like dissection is generally impossible on living brains, brain morphometry starts with noninvasive neuroimaging data, typically obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (or MRI for short). These data are born digital, which allows researchers to analyze the brain images further by using advanced mathematical and statistical methods such as shape quantification or multivariate analysis. This allows researchers to quantify anatomical features of the brain in terms of shape, mass, volume (e.g. of the hippocampus, or of the primary versus secondary visual cortex), and to derive more specific information, such as the encephalization quotient, grey matter density and white matter connectivity, gyrification, cortical thickness, or the amount of cerebrospinal fluid. These variables can then be mapped within the brain volume or on the brain surface, providing a convenient way to assess their pattern and extent over time, across individuals or even between different biological species.

These methods draw from behavioral techniques developed in social psychology, cognitive psychology, and neuropsychology, and are associated with a variety of neurobiological techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), facial electromyography (EMG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), electrocardiograms, electromyograms, endocrinology, immunology, galvanic skin response (GSR), single-cell recording, and studies of focal brain lesion patients. Animal models are also important to investigate the putative role of specific brain structures, circuits, or processes (e.g., the reward system and drug addiction). In addition, quantitative meta-analyses are important to move beyond idiosyncrasies of individual studies, and neurodevelopmental investigations can contribute to our understanding of brain-behavior associations. The two most popular forms of methods used in social neuroscience are fMRI and EEG. fMRI are very cost efficient and high in spatial resolution. However, they are low in temporal resolution and therefore, are best to discover pathways in the brain that are used during social experiments. fMRI have low temporal resolution (timing) because they read oxygenated blood levels that pool to the parts of the brain that are activated and need more oxygen. Thus, the blood takes time to travel to the part of the brain being activated and in reverse provides a lower ability to test for exact timing of activation during social experiments. EEG is best used when a researcher is trying to brain map a certain area that correlates to a social construct that is being studied. EEGs provide high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution. In which, the timing of the activation is very accurate but it is hard to pinpoint exact areas on the brain, researchers are to narrow down locations and areas but they also create a lot of \"noise\". Most recently, researchers have been using TMS which is the best way to discover the exact location in the process of brain mapping. This machine can turn on and off parts of the brain which then allows researchers to test what that part of the brain is used for during social events. However, this machine is so expensive that it is rarely used.",

Magnetic resonance imaging is a vital tool in neurological research in showing activation in the brain as well as providing a comprehensive image of the brain being studied. While MRIs are used clinically for showing brain size, it still has relevance in the study of brains because it can be used to determine extent of injuries or deformation. These can have a significant effect on personality, sense perception, memory, higher order thinking, movement, and spatial understanding. However, current research tends to focus more so on fMRI or real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI). These two methods allow the scientist or the participant, respectively, to view activation in the brain. This is incredibly vital in understanding how a person thinks and how their brain reacts to a person's environment, as well as understanding how the brain works under various stressors or dysfunctions. Real-time functional MRI is a revolutionary tool available to neurologists and neuroscientists because patients can see how their brain reacts to stressors and can perceive visual feedback. CT scans are very similar to MRI in their academic use because they can be used to image the brain upon injury, but they are more limited in perceptual feedback. CTs are generally used in clinical studies far more than in academic studies, and are found far more often in a hospital than a research facility. PET scans are also finding more relevance in academia because they can be used to observe metabolic uptake of neurons, giving researchers a wider perspective about neural activity in the brain for a given condition. Combinations of these methods can provide researchers with knowledge of both physiological and metabolic behaviors of loci in the brain and can be used to explain activation and deactivation of parts of the brain under specific conditions.",

Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive. Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood\u2013brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage.

This changed with two advancements to MRI, the rapidness of MRI techniques were increased to 1.5 Tesla by the end of the 1980s, which provided a 2-d image. Next, endogenous contrast mechanisms were discovered by Detre, Koretsky, and colleagues was based on the net longitudinal magnetization within an organ, and a \u201csecond based on changes in the magnetic susceptibility induced by changing net tissue deoxyhemoglobin content\u201d, which has been labeled BOLD contrast by Siege Ogawa. These discoveries served as inspiration for future brain mapping advancements. This allowed researchers to develop more complex types of experiments, going beyond observing the effects of single types of trials. When fMRI was developed one of its major limitations was the inability to randomize trials, but the event related fMRI fixed this problem. Cognitive subtraction was also an issue, which tried to correlate cognitive-behavioral differences between tasks with brain activity by pairing two tasks that are assumed to be matched perfectly for every sensory, motor, and cognitive process except the one of interest. Next, a push for the improvement of temporal resolution of fMRI studies led to the development of event-related designs, which according to Peterson, was inherited from ERP research in electrophysiology, but it was discovered that this averaging did not apply very well to the hemodynamic response because the response from trials could overlap. As a result, random jittering of the events was applied, which meant that the time repetition was varied and randomized for the trials in order to ensure that the activation signals did not overlap.",

This map reflected which neurons of the brain responded with electrochemical signals to mental processes. He was the first scientist who demonstrated that the functional brain imaging is depended on the oxygenation status of the blood, the BOLD effect. The technique was therefore called Blood oxygenation level-dependent or BOLD contrast.

            "document": "Image-based modeling and rendering . \u2022 Light-field rendering It is a method for generating new views from arbitrary camera positions without depth information or feature matching, simply by combining and resampling the available images. [9]. \u2022 Plenoptic stitching It gives the viewer the ability to explore unobstructed environments of arbitrary sizes and shapes, using appropriate sampling for most viewpoints in the environment by moving omnidirectional video camera over the grid [10]. \u2022 Cylindrical panoramas It provides horizontal orientation independence when exploring an environment from a single point. Cylindrical panoramas can be created using specialized panoramic cameras [11, 12, 13]. \u2022 Concentric mosaics It is a generalization of cylindrical panoramas that allows the viewer to explore a circular region and experience horizontal parallax and lighting effects. In this case, instead of using a single cylindrical image, slit cameras are rotated along planar concentric circles. A series of concentric manifold mosaics are created by composing the slit images acquired by each camera along their circular paths. Unlike light field and lumigraph where cameras are placed on a two-dimensional grid, the concentric mosaics representation reduces the amount of data by capturing a sequence of images along a circle path [14, 15]. \u2022 Lumigraph It is similar to light field rendering, but it applies approximated geometry to compensate for non-uniform sampling, in order to improve rendering performance [16]. \u2022 Transfer methods They are characterized by the use of a relatively small number of images with the application of geometric constraints (either recovered at some stage or known a priori) to reproject image pixels appropriately at a given virtual camera viewpoint [Laveau and Faugeras [17, 18]. \u2022 Relief texture To improve the rendering speed of 3D warping, the warping process is factored into a relatively simple pre-warping step and a traditional texture mapping step [19]. \u2022 Image-based objects They provide a compact image-based representation for 3D objects that can be rendered in occlusion-compatible order. An image-based object is constructed by acquiring multiple views of the object, registering and resampling them from every center of projection onto the faces of a parallelepiped. The use of a parallelepiped allows such a representation to be decomposed into parameterized planar regions for which a warper can be efficiently implemented [20]. \u2022 Image-based visual hulls It is based on efficient computation and shading visual hulls from silhouette image data. The algorithm takes advantage of epipolar geometry and incremental computation to achieve a constant rendering cost per rendered pixel [21]. \u2022 3D Warping With available depth information for every point in one or more images, 3D warping techniques can be used to render from any nearby point of view by projecting the pixels of the original image to their proper 3D locations and re-projecting them onto the new picture [22] \u2022 Layered depth images To deal with the disocclusion artifacts in 3D warping, Layered Depth Image is proposed to store not only what is visible in the input image, but also what is behind the visible surface. Each pixel in the input image contains a list of depth and color values where the ray from the pixel intersects with the scene [23].  \u2022 View-dependent texture maps View-dependent texture mapping is used to render novel views, by warping and compositing several input images. A three-step view-dependent texture mapping method is considered to further reduce the computational cost and provide smoother blending. This method employs visibility preprocessing, polygon-view maps, and projective texture mapping [24, 25]. \u2022 Surface light field It is a function that assigns a color to each ray originating on a surface. Surface light fields are well suited to constructing virtual images of shiny objects under complex lighting conditions [26].  \u2022 Light field mapping This method is a representation and interactive visualization of surface light fields, by partitioning the radiance data over elementary surface primitives and by approximating each partitioned data by a small set of lower-dimensional discrete functions. The rendering algorithm decodes directly from this compact representation at interactive frame rates [27]. For an exhaustive overview of the currently available methods and algorithms in this topic, see the following surveys [1, 28]  [1] Oliveira, Manuel M. \"Image-based modeling and rendering techniques: A survey.\" RITA 9.2 (2002): 37-66.",

These atlases and loose maps taken from them have become of increasing value to collectors and historians. In order for these loose maps to be of full use to historians for study (new counties showed up within two years of their creation and new states of the union almost as soon as they were announced) loose maps from these atlases need to be definitively dated.

For the past decade we have been able to get data and now our technology allows us to share findings and research much easier. This has also allowed for \"brain atlases\" to be made.

Each book contained a complete full-coloured map and an uncoloured map for the student to colour in and to complete names etc., an outline map with coastlines and lines of latitude and longitude, and a blank sheet with the border of only the map. The books allowed the student to draw the maps repeatedly. During the same year, Philip\u2019s also published a completely new set of three Grammar School Atlases edited by Williams: \"Philip\u2019s Grammar School Atlas No. 1\", for preparatory students with 15 full-coloured maps, \"Philip\u2019s Grammar School Atlas No. 2\", for junior students with 30 full-coloured maps, and \"Philip\u2019s Grammar School Atlas No. 3\" for senior students containing 75 full-coloured maps.

Traditionally, histology slides are prepared by embedding a tissue sample in paraffin, taking some few slices of the tissue with a hand-driven microtome, mounting the tissue slices on slides, and staining with various histology stains. A pathologist then looks at these slides with a microscope. In the workflow developed by 3Scan, tissues are stained, embedded, and then sliced and imaged by the KESM. By automating this process, it becomes feasible to take slices of and image the entirety of tissue instead of a few representative slides. In addition to taking more sections, 3Scan\u2019s proprietary software is able to computationally realign these sections in order to visualize the 3D structure of the tissue, similar in appearance to a CT scan. It uses machine vision to produce a 3D spatial map that researchers can analyze on a screen, similar to a topographical map of the Earth. Using these maps, scientists are also able to analyze parts of tissue and phenomena that were previously not visible, such as changes to blood flow between different tissue samples.",

Today, fMRI is often combined with MEG for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, as the methods complement each other.

As the development of FPM techniques, its power has spread from uniform oriented fluorophores to fluorescent dipoles with organized orientation or on complex bio-structures. The detection accuracy has improved from measuring the bulk volume polarization to sub-diffraction area measurement and single dipole measurement. Imaging resolution of FPM matters not only for intensity image but also for the accuracy of dipole orientation detection. Recently developed super resolution FPM techniques still have their limitations though demonstrating great successes in their imaging results. Spatial 3D super resolution FPM techniques and 3D orientation measurement of fluorescent dipoles are still missing. In the future, we anticipate more inventions which could achieve both high-resolution measurement and fast temporal resolution, allowing imaging samples of live cells. This may be done by introducing existing super resolution principles into FPM, or by better exploiting the intensity fluctuation with polarization modulation, or other alternative means.",

            "document": "Magnetic resonance angiography . For the acquisition of the images two different approaches exist. In general, 2D and 3D images can be acquired. If 3D data is acquired, cross sections at arbitrary view angles can be calculated. Three-dimensional data can also be generated by combining 2D data from different slices, but this approach results in lower quality images at view angles different from the original data acquisition. Furthermore, the 3D data can not only be used to create cross sectional images, but also projections can be calculated from the data. Three-dimensional data acquisition might also be helpful when dealing with complex vessel geometries where blood is flowing in all spatial directions (unfortunately, this case also requires three different flow encodings, one in each spatial direction). Both PC-MRA and TOF-MRA have advantages and disadvantages. PC-MRA has fewer difficulties with slow flow than TOF-MRA and also allows quantitative measurements of flow. PC-MRA shows low sensitivity when imaging pulsating and non-uniform flow. In general, slow blood flow is a major challenge in flow dependent MRA. It causes the differences between the blood signal and the static tissue signal to be small. This either applies to PC-MRA where the phase difference between blood and static tissue is reduced compared to faster flow and to TOF-MRA where the transverse blood magnetization and thus the blood signal are reduced. Contrast agents may be used to increase blood signal \u2013 this is especially important for very small vessels and vessels with very small flow velocities that normally show accordingly weak signal. Unfortunately, the use of gadolinium-based contrast media can be dangerous if patients suffer from poor renal function. To avoid these complications as well as eliminate the costs of contrast media, nonenhanced methods have been researched recently.",

Smaller atlases of 17 or 27 or 51 maps could still be purchased and by the mid-1670s an atlas of as many as 151 maps and charts could be purchased from his shop. His atlases cost between 7 and 20 Guilders depending on the number of maps, color and the quality of binding (\u20ac47 or $70 to \u20ac160 or $240 today). In c. 1675 De Wit released a new nautical atlas. The charts in this atlas replaced the earlier charts from 1664 that are known today in only four bound examples and a few loose copies.

The second is a probabilistic map created by combining scans from over a hundred individuals. This normalization to a standard template is done by mathematically checking which combination of stretching, squeezing, and warping reduces the differences between the target and the reference. While this is conceptually similar to motion correction, the changes required are more complex than just translation and rotation, and hence optimization even more likely to depend on the first transformations in the chain that is checked.",
