However, there is a small subset of cases that have an earlier age of onset and have a strong genetic element. In patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (autosomal dominant hereditary), mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be found. The majority of these cases carry mutant presenilin genes. An important part of the disease process in Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) protein. To form A\u03b2, APP must be cut by two enzymes, beta secretases and gamma secretase. Presenilin is the sub-component of gamma secretase that is responsible for the cutting of APP.",

However, because the only difference between the family members who developed Alzheimer's Disease and those that did not in these families was the inheritance of the mutation in the amyloid gene this suggested that the amyloid protein itself could cause the disease. The idea that amyloid could cause the disease influenced scientific research until this day. Many experimental treatments are directed towards lowering amyloid levels in the brain. The other main effect the discovery of the Swedish mutation had was to provide one transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease.

Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called A\u03b242, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between A\u03b242 and the other major forms\u2014particularly A\u03b240\u2014without increasing A\u03b242 levels.",

Since the Ca hypothesis of Alzheimer's was proposed in 1994, several studies have shown that disruptions in Ca signaling are the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease. Familial Alzheimer's disease has been strongly linked to mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. All of the mutated forms of these genes observed to date have been found to cause abnormal Ca signaling in the ER. The functions of PS1 are not yet known, but mutations in PS1 have been shown to increase IP-mediated Ca release from the ER in several animal models. Calcium channel blockers have been used to treat Alzheimer's disease with some success, and the use of lithium to decrease IP turnover has also been suggested as a possible method of treatment.",

The presence of \u03b2-amyloid plaques in the brain causes the body to recruit and activate microglial cells and astrocytes. This is typically a beneficial response; however, not with AD because \u03b2-amyloid plaques stimulate the glial cells to release oxygen free radicals (this pathway is not yet clear). Free radicals are typically effective against abnormal cells, but no way exists for the free radicals to differentiate between normal and abnormal cells. The free radicals destroy \u03b2-amyloid plaques, but also destroy the surrounding healthy tissue. As more tissue dies, the glial cells release chemokines and cytokines (proinflammatory compounds). These compounds recruit more glial cells, which means more free radicals. This uncontrolled glial response and inflammatory storm directly contributes to the neurodegenerative progression of AD.",

There is an association between a diet rich in copper and iron together with saturated fat and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, studies also demonstrate potential beneficial roles of copper in treating rather than causing Alzheimer's disease. For example, copper has been shown to 1) promote the non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), thereby lowering amyloid beta (A\u03b2) production in cell culture systems 2) increase lifetime and decrease soluble amyloid production in APP transgenic mice, and 3) lower A\u03b2 levels in cerebral spinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease patients.",

Alzheimer's Disease is the most common cause of severe memory impairment and is caused by senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neuritis, and neuronal loss. It is thought that Alzheimer's disease may be due to unnecessary protein accumulation of \u03b2 Amyloid. In fact, Senile plaques are dense, protein deposits composed of amyloid \u03b2 peptide. The two types of senile plaques are diffuse plaques and neuritic plaques, and differ in morphology. In addition to the amyloid, the microtubule-associated Tau protein has also been in involved with Alzheimer's Disease and a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases. Inherited forms of Alzheimer's have been linked to mutation in the APP genes or presenilins which regulate APP processing. Because cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis are significantly altered during Alzheimer's progression, cholinergic agents such as choline and lecithin were hypothesized to augment the progression. However, these attempts were unsuccessful and the only clinically useful drugs used in the United States are cholinesterase inhibitors, which prolong the time before choline degradation. Although aNMDA receptor antagonists and anti-inflammatory drugs were tested in a clinical environment, more promising clinical trials are underway to targeting the A\u03b2 with the immune system.",
