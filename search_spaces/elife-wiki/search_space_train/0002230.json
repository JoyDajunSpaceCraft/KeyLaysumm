Cullin-7 acts as scaffold protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The role of this complex is to tag damaged and excess proteins in the cell with ubiquitin. Intracellular and extracellular signals within the cell highly regulate when and which proteins are tagged with ubiquitin. Once attached to the protein, ubiquitin serves as a signaling molecule to the proteasomes, which then bind to the ubiquinated proteins and degrades them. This ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by breaking down unwanted proteins. Additionally, the system regulates the level of proteins involved in critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. Mutations in the CUL7 gene blocks the ability of the cullin-7 protein to bring together the components of this E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This leads to impaired ubiquination and hence the aggregation of damaged, misfolded, and excess proteins. Disruption of the protein degradation process plays a role in the pathogensis of prenatal growth retardation in humans, a key feature of 3-M syndrome. The skeletal abnormalities that are present in individuals with this disorder suggests that this gene may play a role in the endochondral ossification process. Preliminary data suggests that CUL7 is in fact involved in chondrocyte growth and proliferation.",

The function of BAALC protein is not understood very well, but it is predicted to be associated with the cytoskeleton network. When expressed in Bone Marrow CD34+ progenitor cells, BAALC has neuroectodermal and hematopoietic cell functions. Differentiation failure caused by cell shape, motility and adhesion in association between cells are all possible outcomes due to the little known effects and unlear mechanism sites of the BAALC genes. The role of the BAALC gene causing leukemia in immature acute leukemic cells has been found by knocking out the function of BAALC gene using hairpin (stem loop) RNA in a human leukemia cell line KG1a. The result of knocking out BAALC expression is a decrease in uncontrolled cell growth and an increase in programmed cell death. The BAALC protein isoform 1-6-8, has been found to interact and associate with the CAMKII alpha subunit and not with the beta subunit. The interaction with the CAMKII alpha subunit is in the CAMKII protein's regulatory region and near the autophosphorylation site, this suggested a regulatory function of the 1-6-8 isoform on the alpha subunit.

Classical cadherins are important proteins for cells to bind in the body (\u2018\u2019in vivo\u2019\u2019) where they commonly stabilize cell\u2013cell junctions known as adherens junctions. Cadherins stabilize adherens junctions through the interaction of the cadherin cytoplasmic domains with catenin proteins, such as p120-catenin, beta-catenin and alpha-catenin. Catenins, in turn, bind to the actin cytoskeleton. Binding of these proteins to the actin cytoskeleton prevents actin from growing (a process known as polymerization) and therefore keeps cells stationary. Cadherins regulate cell\u2013cell adhesion during development of the body and in adult tissue. Disruption of cadherin proteins, by genetic alteration or by changes to the structure or function of the protein, has been linked to tumor progression. Notably, PTPmu regulates the adhesion of cells to the classical cadherins. PTPmu likely regulates cadherin-dependent adhesion by interacting with both cadherins and catenins via PTPmu\u2019s cytoplasmic domain. To support this assertion, PTPmu has been shown to interact with and/or dephosphorylate many signaling proteins involved in regulating the cadherin-catenin complex, including p120 catenin, and E-cadherin (CDH1 (gene)) and N-cadherin (CDH2). PTPmu has also been shown to interact with the c-Met hepatocyte growth factor receptor, a protein that is also localized to adherens junctions.

Both overexpression of FLCN in FLCN-expressing kidney cells and knockdown of \"FLCN\" resulted in reduced numbers of cilia and aberrant cell divisions, suggesting that levels of FLCN must be tightly regulated for proper ciliogenesis. Primary cilia play a role in inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway ( Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway) by sequestering \u03b2-catenin in the basal body, and dysregulated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling has been linked to kidney cyst formation.

Researchers have shown that FLCN could interact with both subunits in a cilium-dependent manner and localize to cilia in FLCN-expressing but not FLCN-deficient cells. Cilia have been shown to act as flow sensors and suppress mTOR signaling by activating the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 located in the basal body of resting cells in response to flow stimuli. LKB1 in turn phosphorylates and activates AMPK, a negative regulator of mTOR activation. Flow stress was able to suppress mTOR signaling in FLCN-expressing human kidney cells but not under FLCN deficient conditions, and required intact cilia. FLCN was shown to recruit LKB1 and facilitate its interaction with AMPK in the basal body in a flow stress-dependent manner.

These blockages lead to remodeling and infection in the lung, damage by accumulated digestive enzymes in the pancreas, blockage of the intestines by thick feces, etc. Several theories have been posited on how the defects in the protein and cellular function cause the clinical effects. The most current theory suggests that defective ion transport leads to dehydration in the airway epithelia, thickening mucus. In airway epithelial cells, the cilia exist in between the cell's apical surface and mucus in a layer known as airway surface liquid (ASL). The flow of ions from the cell and into this layer is determined by ion channels such as CFTR. CFTR not only allows chloride ions to be drawn from the cell and into the ASL, but it also regulates another channel called ENac, which allows sodium ions to leave the ASL and enter the respiratory epithelium. CFTR normally inhibits this channel, but if the CFTR is defective, then sodium flows freely from the ASL and into the cell. As water follows sodium, the depth of ASL will be depleted and the cilia will be left in the mucous layer. As cilia cannot effectively move in a thick, viscous environment, mucociliary clearance is deficient and a buildup of mucus occurs, clogging small airways. The accumulation of more viscous, nutrient-rich mucus in the lungs allows bacteria to hide from the body's immune system, causing repeated respiratory infections. The presence of the same CFTR proteins in the pancreatic duct and sweat glands in the skin also cause symptoms in these systems.",

Huntington's disease has also been found to affect the cytoskeleton of cells by excess glutamine in the Huntington protein, which is involved with linking vesicles to the cytoskeleton. An error with this protein is proposed to be a factor in the development of the disease. A fourth neurodegenerative disorder is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, which causes a loss of movement by the degradation of motor neurons from defects of the cytoskeleton.",

The cytoskeleton is found underlying the cell membrane in the cytoplasm and provides a scaffolding for membrane proteins to anchor to, as well as forming organelles that extend from the cell. Indeed, cytoskeletal elements interact extensively and intimately with the cell membrane. Anchoring proteins restricts them to a particular cell surface \u2014 for example, the apical surface of epithelial cells that line the vertebrate gut \u2014 and limits how far they may diffuse within the bilayer. The cytoskeleton is able to form appendage-like organelles, such as cilia, which are microtubule-based extensions covered by the cell membrane, and filopodia, which are actin-based extensions. These extensions are ensheathed in membrane and project from the surface of the cell in order to sense the external environment and/or make contact with the substrate or other cells. The apical surfaces of epithelial cells are dense with actin-based finger-like projections known as microvilli, which increase cell surface area and thereby increase the absorption rate of nutrients. Localized decoupling of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane results in formation of a bleb.",

Recent findings regarding its physiological roles in chemical sensation, signal transduction, and control of cell growth, have led scientists to acknowledge its importance in cell function, with the discovery of its role in diseases not previously recognized to involve the dysgenesis and dysfunction of cilia, such as polycystic kidney disease, congenital heart disease, and an emerging group of genetic ciliopathies. The primary cilium is now known to play an important role in the function of many human organs.
