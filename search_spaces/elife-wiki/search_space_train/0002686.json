Meniere\u2019s attacks occur when there is an increase in endolymphatic volume in the inner ear, causing a temporary leak in the membrane separating the perilymph (potassium poor fluid) and the endolymph (potassium rich fluid). The mix of these two fluids surrounding the vestibular sensory cells can lead to a temporary electrical blockade and loss of sensory function. The sudden change in the rate of the vestibular nerve firing results in a disturbance of signal processing in the corresponding brain regions, and thus to acute sensations of imbalance, otherwise known as vertigo.",

Should the balance of the drilling mud pressure be incorrect (i.e., the mud pressure gradient is less than the formation pore pressure gradient), then formation fluids (oil, natural gas and/or water) can begin to flow into the wellbore and up the annulus (the space between the outside of the drill string and the wall of the open hole or the inside of the casing), and/or inside the drill pipe. This is commonly called a \"kick\". Ideally, mechanical barriers such as blowout preventers (BOPs) can be closed to isolate the well while the hydrostatic balance is regained through circulation of fluids in the well. But if the well is not shut in (common term for the closing of the blow-out preventer), a kick can quickly escalate into a blowout when the formation fluids reach the surface, especially when the influx contains gas that expands rapidly with the reduced pressure as it flows up the wellbore, further decreasing the effective weight of the fluid.",

            "document": "Motion sickness . A specific form of motion sickness, car sickness, is quite common and evidenced by intolerance for reading a map or book during travel. Car sickness results from the sensory conflict arising in the brain from differing sensory inputs. Motion sickness is caused by a conflict between signals arriving in the brain from the inner ear, which forms the base of the vestibular system, the sensory apparatus that deals with movement and balance, and which detects motion mechanically. If someone is looking at a stationary object within a vehicle, such as a magazine, their eyes will inform their brain that what they are viewing is not moving. Their inner ears, however, will contradict this by sensing the motion of the vehicle. Varying theories exist as to cause. One suggests the eyes view motion while riding in the moving vehicle while other body sensors sense stillness, creating conflict between the eyes and inner ear. Another suggests the eyes mostly see the interior of the car which is motionless while the vestibular system of the inner ear senses motion as the vehicle goes around corners or over hills and even small bumps. Therefore, the effect is worse when looking down but may be lessened by looking outside of the vehicle.",

Depending on the mucopolysaccharidosis subtype, affected individuals may have normal intellect or have cognitive impairments, may experience developmental delay, or may have severe behavioral problems. Many individuals have hearing loss, either conductive (in which pressure behind the eardrum causes fluid from the lining of the middle ear to build up and eventually congeal), neurosensory (in which tiny hair cells in the inner ear are damaged), or both. Communicating hydrocephalus\u2014in which the normal reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked and causes increased pressure inside the head\u2014is common in some of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Surgically inserting a shunt into the brain can drain fluid. The eye's cornea often becomes cloudy from intracellular storage, and glaucoma and degeneration of the retina also may affect the patient's vision.",

            "document": "Dolphin . The dolphin ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The dolphin ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. Though most dolphins do not have hair, they do have hair follicles that may perform some sensory function. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on an object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the boto are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for the boto's poor eyesight.",

A labyrinthine fistula is an abnormal opening in the bony capsule of the inner ear, resulting in leakage of the perilymph from the cochlea into the middle ear. This includes specifically a perilymph fistula (PLF), an abnormal connection between the fluid of the inner ear and the air-filled middle ear. This connection is caused by a rupture of the round window that separate the inner and middle ear. Another type of labyrinthine fistula is a semicircular canal dehiscence, which allows the inner ear to be influenced by the intracranial pressure directly.",

Using these models, the cranial endocast was shown to encompass in volume. The inner ear was tall and wide. The lagena, the part containing the hair cells for hearing, was rather short, indicating that the sense of hearing would have been poorer in \"Amargasaurus\" than in other sauropods for which inner ears have been studied.",

Hu et al. transplanted adult mice NSCs into normal and deafened inner ears of guinea pigs. Prior to implantation, the NSCs were treated with neurogenin 2 protein to encourage proliferation of the intended inner ear cells. They concluded that adult NSCs were indeed able to survive and differentiate in the injured inner ear, and that this type of therapy could possibly act to restore auditory function in hearing impaired subjects. This experiment also indicates that genetic engineering can contribute to the success of generating specific progenitor cells of interest.",

Syphilis can cause some patients to develop the disease later in life. The disease is characterized by pressure in the ears, ringing in the ears, and vertigo. It also causes nystagmus, or uncontrollable eye movements. There is no known treatment for the disorder, although symptoms can be treated.
