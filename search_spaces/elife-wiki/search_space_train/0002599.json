Using doses between 1 \u03bcM to 3 \u03bcM of RA can generate neurons as the most abundant cell type. Neurons under this treatment reached the highest populations between six days and nine days. Several neuronal markers such as neurofilament proteins, HNK-1 antigen and tetanus toxin binding sites are expressed at highest levels during these days. After six to nine days of treatment, the relative neuronal population declines, likely because of faster proliferation of non-neuronal cells. After 10 days of exposure, astroglial cells can be detected using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a specific marker of glial cells. Other than into neurons and astrocytes, P19 cells can also differentiate to oligodendrocytes, which can be detected using the specific markers, myelin-associated glycoprotein and 2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase. Moreover, oligodendrocytes also developed and migrated into fiber bundles in mice when the RA-induced cells were transplanted into the brains.  Retinoic acid can induce not only P19 cells but also other progenitor cells or embryonic stem cells to differentiation. Since cells after retinoic acid treatment did not immediately express neuronal marker genes, RA must initiate some pathway to process cellular differentiation. Many studies used P19 cells to investigate the RA-induced mechanisms, including generating the mutant allele of retinoic acid receptor genes and studying the expression of receptor genes, Hox genes and retinol binding proteins while exposing to RA. All of these studies indicate that the P19 cell is a good in vitro model system for investigating the mechanism of drugs that interfere with specific cellular pathway. What is more, by using the ability of RA-induced neurogenesis in P19 cell, lots of researchers started to identify the in vitro differentiation mechanisms of neuro- or gliogenesis. Several related pathways or including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, Notch pathway and hedgehog pathway are investigated either using gene expression or generating alleles for related genes.",

It contains a Ras exchange motif, a diacylglycerol-binding domain, and two calcium-binding EF hands. This protein was shown to activate H-Ras in a cation-dependent manner in vitro. Expression of this protein in myeloid cell lines was found to be correlated with elevated level of activated RAS protein, and the RAS activation can be greatly enhanced by phorbol ester treatment, which suggested a role of this protein in diacylglycerol regulated cell signaling pathways.

During development there is a concentration gradient of retinoic acid along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to retinoic acid differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates the hindbrain transiently forms eight rhombomers and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If retinoic acid is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead rhombomeres 1\u20134 grow to cover the same amount of space as all eight would normally occupy. Retinoic acid has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of Homeobox (Hox) genes which encode different homeodomain transcription factors which in turn can turn on cell type specific genes. Deletion of the Homeobox (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. Retinoic acid is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but retinoic acid synthesized in the retina is secreted into surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause microphthalmia, defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup.",

The hindbrain differentiates into the brain stem and serves as a major signaling center during the initial development of the heart. Retinoic acid gradient is vital in somite formation, as well as the formation of the atria in the heart. Malformations can arise when the concentration of RA is in excess or deficient. The hindbrain becomes enlarged when there is excess RA, hindering the growth of other parts of the brain. Other abnormalities that can occur are missing or fused somites and problems with the aorta and large vessels within the heart. With an accumulation of these malformations, an individual can be diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome. However, since RA partakes in various developmental processes abnormalities are not just limited to sites associated with DiGeorge syndrome. Retinoic acid is essential throughout an individual\u2019s lifetime, but it is critical during pregnancy.

The MRAS gene is expressed specifically in brain, heart, myoblasts, myotubes, fibroblasts, skeletal muscles, and uterus, suggesting a specific role of M-Ras in these tissue and cells. M-Ras is involved in many biological processes by activating a wide variety of proteins. For instance, it is activated by Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors and can bind/activate some Ras protein effectors. M-Ras also weakly stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and ERK2 activity, but modestly stimulates trans-activation from different nuclear response elements which bind transcription factors, such as SRF, ETS/TCF, Jun/Fos, and NF- kB/Rel. M-Ras has been found to induce Akt kinase activity in the PI3-K pathway, and it may play a role in cell survival of neural-derived cells. Moreover, M-Ras plays a crucial role in the downregulation of OCT4 and NANOG protein levels upon differentiation and has been demonstrated to modulate cell fate at early steps of development during neurogenesis. M-Ras, induced and activated by BMP-2 signaling, also participates in the osteoblastic determination, differentiation, and transdifferentiation under p38 MAPK and JNK regulation. M-Ras is involved in TNF-alpha-stimulated and Rap1-mediated LFA-1 activation in splenocytes. More generally, cells transfected with M-Ras exhibit dendritic appearances with microspikes, suggesting that M-Ras may participate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, it is reported that M-Ras forms a complex with SCRIB and SHOC2, a polarity protein with tumor suppressor properties, and may play a key role in tumorigenic growth.",

The origin and expression pattern of the nodal signaling proteins differs in different species. Mammalian nodal signaling is initiated ubiquitously in epiblast cells and is maintained by autoregulatory signaling of Wnt3 and limited by the induction of antagonists such as Cerberus-like and lefty. Studies in \"Xenopus\" have found that xnr expression (the \"Xenopus\" nodal) is induced by VegT at the vegetal pole and nodals spread to the blastula. Xnr expression is stabilized by the presence of \u03b2-catenin. This information raises the question of how nodal signaling leads to the induction of both endoderm and mesoderm. The answer comes in form of a gradient of nodal protein. Temporal and spatial differences in nodal signaling will result in different cell fates. With the addition of antagonists and variable range of different nodals, a map of cell fates including both mesoderm and endoderm can be drawn for the embryo. However, it is unclear whether nodal signaling is summated or if cells respond to the amplitude of the signal.",

The availability of GFP and its derivatives has thoroughly redefined fluorescence microscopy and the way it is used in cell biology and other biological disciplines. While most small fluorescent molecules such as FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) are strongly phototoxic when used in live cells, fluorescent proteins such as GFP are usually much less harmful when illuminated in living cells. This has triggered the development of highly automated live-cell fluorescence microscopy systems, which can be used to observe cells over time expressing one or more proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins. For example, GFP had been widely used in labelling the spermatozoa of various organisms for identification purposes as in \"Drosophila melanogaster\", where expression of GFP can be used as a marker for a particular characteristic. GFP can also be expressed in different structures enabling morphological distinction. In such cases, the gene for the production of GFP is incorporated into the genome of the organism in the region of the DNA that codes for the target proteins and that is controlled by the same regulatory sequence; that is, the gene's regulatory sequence now controls the production of GFP, in addition to the tagged protein(s). In cells where the gene is expressed, and the tagged proteins are produced, GFP is produced at the same time. Thus, only those cells in which the tagged gene is expressed, or the target proteins are produced, will fluoresce when observed under fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of such time lapse movies has redefined the understanding of many biological processes including protein folding, protein transport, and RNA dynamics, which in the past had been studied using fixed (i.e., dead) material.

In P19 cells, using non-toxic concentration of drugs to aggregated embryoid body cells can induce P19 cells differentiating into specific cell lines based on different drugs. The most two common and effective drugs are retinoic acid (RA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Studies have shown that a certain concentration of RA can induce P19 cells to differentiate into neuronal cells, including neurons and glial cells. while 0.5% - 1% DMSO led P19 cells differentiate to cardiac or skeletal muscle cells.

Those studies revealed that the different drug exposure can lead the multipotent P19 cells to different layers of cells.

This work led to the identification of the closely related cellular oncogene ErbB2/HER2, which is over-expressed in a major subset of breast cancers and is the target of the important targeted therapy, trastuzumab. From 1986 to 1989, he was a postdoctoral researcher with Robert Weinberg, at the Whitehead Institute for biomedical research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downward's research investigates cancer biology. His work on the Ras GTPase has made seminal contributions to our understanding of how cellular signal transduction pathways are subverted in oncogenic transformation. His work provided the first demonstration that Guanosine triphosphate-loading on Ras, which is commonly mutationally activated in human tumours, is normally regulated in response to extracellular factors; he went on to characterise growth factor receptor complexes mediating Ras nucleotide exchange, and to demonstrate that GTP-bound Ras binds to and activates the RAF kinase, which controls the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Julian was first to demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is also a Ras effector, important in regulation of apoptosis. He showed that transformation by Ras requires interaction with multiple effectors, which contribute differentially to cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. His work has established that both cell matrix and cell\u2013cell interaction activate the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway, and thereby prevent programmed cell death, and that it is activation of this pathway by oncogenic Ras that allows anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells. Most recently he has focused on identifying unique weaknesses of cancer cells expressing the activated Ras oncogene using a combination of large-scale functional genomics and pre-clinical models of lung cancer.",

The FESD Version II would also be a good choice in database because it also covers the dbSNP database. They ran the Haseman Elston test, then a random forest algorithm. The shared SNPs detected were then ran through a polymorphism interaction analysis (PIA) algorithm. They performed Gene ontology analysis of the 5 modules that were created. They suggested that Ets-1 may be an important transcription factor in the cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathway and destructive cascade characteristic of RA. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCA1, was induced during differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages, and there was a dual regulatory function for ABCA1 in macrophage lipid metabolism and inflammation. Extracellular signals are transduced intracellularly via multiple pathways, resulting in alterations in the transcription and translation of specific proteins. Some of these signaling pathways result in the production of proteins, including cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. The zinc-finger protein 238 (ZNF238) is attached to zinc-finger proteins that can regulate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Hub gene CD160 is a potential RA association gene. The CD160 receptor represents a unique triggering surface molecule that is expressed by cytotoxic NK cells, it participates in the inflammatory response and determines the type of subsequent specific immunity.",

While the hindbrain is developing, trigeminal cell bodies have been shown to migrate dorsolaterally within rhombomeres 2 and 3, while facial cells move dorsolaterally into r5 near the pial surface. Neurons that form the facial nucleus are produced in r4, but move along the anteroposterior axis of the hindbrain into r6, after which they move dorsolaterally. The vestibuloacoustic neurons are also produced in r4. However, they have a unique migration pattern, where their cell bodies cross the midline to the contralateral side. From this one can conclude that multiple subclasses of motor neurons are produced in specific locations in the developing hindbrain. All of them are related by the expression of Tbx20. Motor neurons produced in the hindbrain have Tbx20 selectively expressed. In Tbx20 mutations, the patterning of the regions of the rhombomeres and motor neurons were normal when they were conditional mutations and the neurons were post-mitotic. Tbx20 mutants pre-mitotic showed many cell migration deficiencies, including abnormal dorsolateral migration of the trigeminal cells, arrested tangential migration of the facial neurons, and a lack of transmedian migration of vestibuloacoustic cells. However, hindbrain motor neurons lacking Tbx20 retained the ability to extend neurites into the periphery. The complete elimination of Tbx20 does not cause trigeminal and facial neurons to switch to hypoglossal neurons. Facial neurons have been shown to migrate tangentially from r4 to r6, while trigeminal neurons that are produced in r2 migrate dorsolaterally non-radially. Vestibuloacoustic cells migrate along the midline at r4 contralaterally in the hindbrain. Tbx20 seems to have context-dependent transcriptional activity.

In 1991, scientists became aware that self-avoidance was also present in non-neuronal cell types, such as leech comb cells, which might similarly form discrete domains. Later, this was also observed in mammalian astrocytes. Wang and Macagno, in 1998, again recurring to \"Hirudo medicinalis\" mechanosensory neurons, performed an elegant experiment in order to try to answer the still remaining question: \"How does a cell recognize self and respond by not growing over or along itself?\" The authors then proposed two general types of mechanisms: I) External signals: Sibling neurites display surface identifying molecular factors, unique to each cell, that are capable of homotypic binding and therefore repel sibling neurites, or II) Internal signals: synchronous cell activity, such as voltage, which is transmitted within the cell mediating a dynamic mechanism of sibling growth inhibition. Contrarily to the first hypothesis, the second would require the continuity and communication between all parts of the cell for self-avoidance to occur. So the experiment consisted of detaching one of the neurons dendrites and see how the remaining attached dendrites reacted towards the detached fragment, \"do they still avoid overlapping?\" The result was that the detached branch would stop being recognized as \"self\" by the other branches of the neuronal, leading to dendrite overlap. The clear conclusion of the study was that continuity between all parts of the neuron is critical for self-avoidance to operate. The authors then suggest various mechanisms that require continuity and could function as recognition signal, and thus might be the responsible ones, such as \"electrical activity, active or passive, as well as the diffusion of cytoplasmic signals either passively or by fast axonal transport\". In the late 1990s and beyond, model organisms started to be used in the studies and the molecular mechanisms of self-avoidance started to be unraveled. In 1999 Wu and Maniatis discovered a striking organization of a large family of human neural protocadherin cell adhesion genes which formed a gene cluster encoding 58 protocadherins. The members of the protocadherin gene cluster were compelling candidates to provide the molecular code required for the maintenance of the self/non-self discrimination that led to self-avoidance. It was later (2012) confirmed, by Lefebvre et al., in a study with amacrine cells and Purkinje cells of \"Mus musculus\", that these proteins are expressed in different combinations in individual neurons, thus providing \"barcodes\" with that distinguish one neuron from another.",

During development there is a concentration gradient of retinoic acid along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to retinoic acid differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates the hindbrain transiently forms eight rhombomers and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If retinoic acid is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead rhombomeres 1\u20134 grow to cover the same amount of space as all eight would normally occupy. Retinoic acid has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of Homeobox (Hox) genes which encode different homeodomain transcription factors which in turn can turn on cell type specific genes. Deletion of the Homeobox (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. Retinoic acid is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but retinoic acid synthesized in the retina is secreted into surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause microphthalmia, defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup.",

(Recall that glycoproteins are proteins with covalently bound carbohydrates, usually short chains of sugars.) The most abundant glycoprotein in the ECM of most animal cells is collagen, which forms strong fibers outside the cells. In fact, collagen accounts for about 40% of the total protein in the human body. The collagen fibers are embedded in a network woven from proteoglycans. A proteoglycan molecule consists of a small core protein with many carbohydrate chains covalently attached, so that it may be up to 95% carbohydrate. Large proteoglycan complexes can form when hundreds of proteoglycans become noncovalently attached to a single long polysaccharide molecule. Some cells are attached to the ECM by still other ECM glycoproteins such as fibronectin. Fibronectin and other ECM proteins bind to cell surface receptor proteins called integrins that are built into the plasma membrane. Integrins span the membrane and bind on the cytoplasmic side to associated proteins attached to microfilaments of the cytoskeleton. The name integrin is based on the word integrate, integrins are in a position to transmit signals between the ECM and the cytoskeleton and thus to integrate changes occurring outside and inside the cell. Current research on fibronectin, other ECM molecules, and integrins is revealing the influential role of the ECM in the lives of cells. By communicating with a cell through integrins, the ECM can regulate a cell's behavior. For example, some cells in a developing embryo migrate along specific pathways by matching the orientation of their microfilaments to the \"grain\" of fibers in the ECM. Researchers are also learning that the ECM around a cell can influence the activity of genes in the nucleus. Information about the ECM probably reaches the nucleus by a combination of mechanical and chemical signaling pathways. Mechanical signaling involves fibronectin, integrins, and microfilaments of the cytoskeleton. Changes in the cytoskeleton may in turn trigger chemical signaling pathways inside the cell, leading to changes in the set of proteins being made by the cell and therefore changes in the cells function. In this way, the ECM of a particular tissue may help coordinate the behavior of all the cells within that tissue. Direct connections between cells also function in this coordination.",

Using doses between 1 \u03bcM to 3 \u03bcM of RA can generate neurons as the most abundant cell type. Neurons under this treatment reached the highest populations between six days and nine days. Several neuronal markers such as neurofilament proteins, HNK-1 antigen and tetanus toxin binding sites are expressed at highest levels during these days. After six to nine days of treatment, the relative neuronal population declines, likely because of faster proliferation of non-neuronal cells. After 10 days of exposure, astroglial cells can be detected using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a specific marker of glial cells. Other than into neurons and astrocytes, P19 cells can also differentiate to oligodendrocytes, which can be detected using the specific markers, myelin-associated glycoprotein and 2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase. Moreover, oligodendrocytes also developed and migrated into fiber bundles in mice when the RA-induced cells were transplanted into the brains.  Retinoic acid can induce not only P19 cells but also other progenitor cells or embryonic stem cells to differentiation. Since cells after retinoic acid treatment did not immediately express neuronal marker genes, RA must initiate some pathway to process cellular differentiation. Many studies used P19 cells to investigate the RA-induced mechanisms, including generating the mutant allele of retinoic acid receptor genes and studying the expression of receptor genes, Hox genes and retinol binding proteins while exposing to RA. All of these studies indicate that the P19 cell is a good in vitro model system for investigating the mechanism of drugs that interfere with specific cellular pathway. What is more, by using the ability of RA-induced neurogenesis in P19 cell, lots of researchers started to identify the in vitro differentiation mechanisms of neuro- or gliogenesis. Several related pathways or including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, Notch pathway and hedgehog pathway are investigated either using gene expression or generating alleles for related genes.",

            "document": "Compartment (development) . To explain how anterior and posterior cells are kept separated, the differential adhesion hypothesis proposes that these two cell populations express different adhesion molecules, producing different affinities for each other that minimize their contact. The selector affinity model proposes that difference in cell affinity between compartments is a result of differential selector gene expression. The presence or absence of selector genes in a given compartment produces compartment-specific adhesion or recognition molecules that are different from those in its counterpart. For example, \"engrailed\" expressed in the posterior, but not the anterior, cells provides the differential affinity that keeps these compartments separately. It is also possible that this difference in cell adhesion/affinity is not directly due to \"en\" expression, but rather to the ability to receive Hh signaling. Anterior cells, capable of Hh transduction, will express given adhesive molecules that would differ from those present in posterior cells, creating differential affinity that would prevent them from intermixing. This signaling-affinity model is supported by experiments that demonstrate the importance of Hh signaling. Clones mutant for the \"Smoothened (smo)\", the gene responsible for transducing Hh signaling, retain anterior-like features, but move into the posterior compartment without any changes in the expression \"engrailed\" or invected. This demonstrates that Hh signaling, rather than the absence of en, is what gives cells their compartmental identity. Nonetheless, this signaling-affinity model is incomplete: \"smo\" mutant clones of anterior origin that migrate into the posterior compartment, do not completely associate with these cells, but rather form a smooth boundary with these posterior cells. If signaling-affinity were the only factor determining compartment identity, then these clones, which are no longer receiving Hh signaling, would have the same affinity as the other posterior cells in that compartment and be able to intermix with them. These experiments indicate that although Hh signaling could be having an effect in adhesive properties, this effect is limited to the border cells rather than throughout both compartments. It is also possible that both compartments produce the same cell adhesion molecules, but a difference in its abundance or activity could result in sorting between the two compartments. In vitro, transfected cells with high levels of a given adhesion molecule will segregate from cells that expressing lower levels of this same molecule. Finally, differences in cell bond tension could also play a role in the establishment of the boundary and the separation of the two different cell populations. Experimental data has shown that Myosin-II is up-regulated along both the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior boundaries in the imaginal wing disc. The D/V boundary is characterized by the presence of filamentous actin and mutations in Myosin-II heavy chain impairs D/V compartmentalization. Similarly, both F-actin and Myosin-II are increased along the A/P boundary, accompanied by a decrease of \"Bazooka\", which was also observed in the D/V border. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632, of which Myosin-II is the main target, significantly reduces cell bond tension, suggesting that Myosin-II could be the main effector of this process. In support of the signaling-affinity model, creating an artificial interface between cells with active vs. inactive Hh signaling induces a junctional behavior that aligns the cell bonds of where these opposing cell types meet. Moreover, a 2.5-fold increase in mechanical tension is observed along the A/P boundary, compared to the rest of the tissue. Simulations using a vertex model demonstrate that this increase in cell bond tension is enough to maintain proliferating cell populations in separate compartment boundaries. Parameters used to measure cell bond tension are based cell-cell adhesion and cortical tension input. It has also been suggested that boundary formation is not a result of differential mechanical tension between the two cell populations, but could be a result of the mechanical properties of the boundary itself. Interestingly, the level the adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, was unaltered and the biophysical properties of cells between the two compartments were the same. Changes in cell properties, such as an enlarged apical cross-section area, are only observed in anterior and posterior border cells. Along the boundary, orientation of cell divisions was random and there is no evidence that increased cell death or zones of non-proliferating cells are important for maintaining the A/P or D/V boundary.",

The integration of cooperative and communicative interactions appear to be extremely important to microbes; for example, 6\u201310% of all genes in the bacterium \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" are controlled by cell-cell signaling systems. One way that microbes communicate and organize with each other in order to partake in more advanced cooperative interactions is through quorum sensing. Quorum sensing describes the phenomenon in which the accumulation of signaling molecules in the surrounding environment enables a single cell to assess the number of individuals (cell density) so that the population as a whole can make a coordinated response. This interaction is fairly common among bacterial taxa, and involves the secretion by individual cells of 'signaling' molecules, called autoinducers or pheromones.These bacteria also have a receptor that can specifically detect the signaling molecule. When the inducer binds the receptor, it activates transcription of certain genes, including those for inducer synthesis. There is a low likelihood of a bacterium detecting its own secreted inducer. Thus, in order for gene transcription to be activated, the cell must encounter signaling molecules secreted by other cells in its environment. When only a few other bacteria of the same kind are in the vicinity, diffusion reduces the concentration of the inducer in the surrounding medium to almost zero, so the bacteria produce little inducer. However, as the population grows the concentration of the inducer passes a threshold, causing more inducer to be synthesized. This forms a positive feedback loop, and the receptor becomes fully activated. Activation of the receptor induces the up regulation of other specific genes, causing all of the cells to begin transcription at approximately the same time. In other words, when the local concentration of these molecules has reached a threshold, the cells respond by switching on particular genes. In this way individual cells can sense the local density of bacteria, so that the population as a whole can make a coordinated response.",

Induction of the floor plate during embryogenesis of vertebrate embryos has been studied extensively in chick and zebrafish and occurs as a result of a complex signaling network among tissues, the details of which have yet to be fully refined. Currently there are several competing lines of thought. First, floor plate differentiation may be mediated by inductive signaling from the underlying notochord, an axial mesoderm derived signaling structure. This is supported experimentally in chick, in which floor plate induction, as well as associative ventral nervous tissue differentiation, is mediated by the secreted signaling molecule sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh is expressed in a gradient with highest concentration localized in the notochord and floor plate. \"In vitro\" tissue grafting experiments show that removal of this molecule prevents differentiation of the floor plate, whereas its ectopic expression induces differentiation of floor plate cells. An alternative view proposes that neural tube floor plate cells stem from precursor cells which migrate directly from axial mesoderm. Through chick \u2013 quail hybrid experiments as well as genetic interaction experiments in zebrafish, it appears that notochord and floor plate cells originate from a common precursor. Furthermore, in zebrafish, Nodal signaling is required for differentiation of medial floor plate cells whereas Shh is expendable. These data may indicate that the floor plate induction mechanism in amniotes and anamniotes differs. To reconcile these differences, a dual-mode induction model has been proposed in chick. In this model, exclusively ectodermal cells are induced to become medial floor plate during gastrulation by prechordal mesoderm, possibly through Nodal signaling. Later in development during neurulation, extended contact and interaction between notochord and fated floor plate cells causes differentiation, suggesting a cooperative effect between Nodal and Shh signaling.",

Removing cells from the posterior region of the limb, they transplanted them to the anterior region and noticed that extra digits formed in the anterior area and these digits were mirror images to the normal ones. This posterior mesenchyme was the ZPA, which is now known to express the protein sonic hedgehog (Shh). One hypothesis is that at high concentrations, this unknown morphogen causes mesenchyme to form on the posterior side, while low concentrations induces meshenchyme to form on the anterior end. Identifying this morphogen was the next crucial step. The first hypothesis came from Tickle et al. who showed that when retinoic acid is placed in the anterior margin of the limb bud, mirror image duplications result. However, concentrations of retinoic acid that cause mirror image duplications induce high levels of a downstream gene, retinoic acid receptor Beta, which is not seen in the posterior region. It is now known that endogenous retinoic acid acts permissively prior to limb bud initiation to allow the budding process to begin, and that the specific morphogen, hypothesized to be Shh, is normally expressed independently of retinoic acid in the posterior region of the limb bud. By looking at signaling homologs of other organisms, the segmentation gene of \"Drosophila\", hedgehog, served as a viable candidate.",

The germ cells are bipotential in that prior to migrating to the gonads, they are capable of forming either spermatogonia or oogonia. The specification into either female or male fates for the organism itself also depends on the development of the gonads, which have yet to differentiate into ether ovaries or testes. In the mouse, somatic sex determination (i.e. determination of either female or male gonads) begins at embryonic day 10.5 in mice, but is not finalised until day 12.5. Male somatic cell specification involves the Y-chromosome specific Sry gene, which regulates the specification of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Without the specification of those cells, the gonad formation is regulated by the X-chromosomes, forming the ovaries. After the fate of the gonads is finalised, the sex specification of the germ cells occurs at 12.5-15.5 days. Sex specification of the germ cells requires the repression of pluripotency and relies on the communication between the somatic cells of the gonads and germ cells Reitzel et al., 2015. The mechanisms for male and female differentiation are markedly different, since a population of sperm producing spermatogonia are retained throughout development and into adult life Reitzel et al., 2015, unlike oogonia which only produce oocyte in utero. When the germ cells reach the gonads, they undergo proliferation via mitosis and at 13.5 days of rat development they begin to undergo meiosis in the ovary but arrested at the mitotic stage in the testes. In the ovary, after mitosis, the gametogonium undergo meiosis, which is initiated by intrinsic competence factor DazL and extrinsic retinoic acid, excreted by the mesonephros.
