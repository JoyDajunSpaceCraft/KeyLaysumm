The data that has been collected through dinosaur dental histological studies are typically unavailable through other means and has provided us with a more in-depth understanding on their biology. One of the most significant findings is that despite differences in their appearance, dinosaur teeth are essentially composed of the same dental tissues found in modern mammals, crocodilians and other amniotes, suggesting that these tissues first evolved in a common ancestor and has been retained ever since. Another finding is that the lines of von Ebner can be counted similar to tree rings to determine the age of a tooth. Furthermore, as dinosaurs continuously replace their teeth, the difference in age between the largest and oldest teeth and the smallest and youngest teeth provides us with the rate of tooth replacement. Work on the early theropod dinosaur \"Coelophysis\" established that the ancestral dental attachment mode of dinosaurs is the same thecodonty as in mammals and crocodilians, In mammals thecodonty is associated with dental occlusion while in crocodilians it has been proposed as a means to reduce stresses from bite forces. \"Coelophysis\" possessed neither dental occlusion nor a strong bite, raising questions as to why it possesses thecodonty. Histological work on the hadrosaur dental batteries led to the creation of a developmental model that explains how the batteries were formed by the teeth growing faster and maturing earlier, to the point that the pulp cavity of individual teeth are totally filled with dentine before it even erupts. The lack of pulp in the tooth post-eruption means that the tooth is essentially dead and able to be completely worn away through use and replaced without the risk of exposing the normally sensitive dental pulp to infection and pain. While other dinosaurs such as some ceratopsians and sauropods also possesses dental batteries, they all evolved independently and differ in some form or function from those of hadrosaurs. This shows that some dinosaurs had evolved extremely sophisticated oral processing capabilities independent of the type of mammalian chewing we are familiar with.",

Species of hybodonts are often determined based on their teeth fossils which are more likely to be preserved the rock record than the remainder of the sharks\u2019 skeleton. Teeth are abundant in the fossil record because sharks shed them throughout their lifetime and teeth are resistant to erosion. Hybodont teeth are often preserved as incomplete fossils because the base of the tooth is not well attached to the crown. Hybodonts were initially divided into two groups based on their tooth shape. One group had teeth with acuminate cusps that lacked a pulp cavity; these are called osteodont teeth. The other group had a different cusp arrangement and had a pulp cavity, these are called orthodont teeth. For example, the hybodont species \"Heterophychodus steinmanni\" have osteodont teeth with vascular canals of dentine which are arranged vertically parallel to each other, also called \u2018tubular dentine\u2019. The crowns of these osteodont teeth are covered with a single layer of enameloid. Hybodonts are characterized by having two dorsal fins each preceded by a fin spine with a specific shape. The fin spines shape is used to distinguish hybodonts from other shark groups and different hybodont species. The fin spines are elongate and gently curved toward the back of the animal. Male hybodonts had small spines across their heads. Hybodonts had thick, massive jaws that vary between different genera according to diet and teeth. Hybodonts had paired fins for steering and a fully heterocercal, or uneven tail, with the dorsal fin extending further than the ventral tail fin. One of the best hybodont fossils is a specimen of \"Tribodus\" from the Santana Formation (Early Cretaceous) of northeastern Brazil. A three dimensional specimen was recovered revealing the shape of the pectoral fins and how they attach to the scapula.",

One of the first studies was published in 1955 and investigated the correlation between diet and tooth morphology. Hotton (1955) found that the tooth morphology did vary with diet, and that herbivorous taxa tended to possess laterally compressed, sharp, cuspate teeth. Later research supported this, and found that this morphology, particularly in \"Iguana\", may be used to shear plants. Throckmorton (1976) compared \"Iguana iguana\" and \"Uromastyx aegyptia\" and found distinct similarities and differences between the taxa. It was found that both used their dentition to crop plants, even though their tooth shape differs significantly. The teeth come together and act as scissors, which allow the jaw muscles to act at one point at a time, shearing the plant material. In both animals the fleshy tongue is used to hold the plant material in place as the teeth cut through it. In \"Iguana iguana\" the pterygoid teeth aid in stabilizing the food, whereas the dentary of \"Uromastyx\" moves back to accomplish the same task. The difference in dental morphology between these two taxa is due to distinct tooth replacement strategies. The \"Iguana\" teeth are continually replaced, likely due to their fragility, whereas the \"Uromastyx\" teeth are not replaced and must be longer lasting. It is thought that little mastication occurs in both species, aside from simple cropping. Unfortunately, little other research has been conducted on the function of herbivorous reptile teeth.",

Throughout the mouth, all teeth undergo this same process; it is still uncertain why teeth form various crown shapes\u2014for instance, incisors versus canines. There are two dominant hypotheses. The \"field model\" proposes there are components for each type of tooth shape found in the ectomesenchyme during tooth development. The components for particular types of teeth, such as incisors, are localized in one area and dissipate rapidly in different parts of the mouth. Thus, for example, the \"incisor field\" has factors that develop teeth into incisor shape, and this field is concentrated in the central incisor area, but decreases rapidly in the canine area. The other dominant hypothesis, the \"clone model\", proposes that the epithelium programs a group of ectomesenchymal cells to generate teeth of particular shapes. This group of cells, called a clone, coaxes the dental lamina into tooth development, causing a tooth bud to form. Growth of the dental lamina continues in an area called the \"progress zone\". Once the progress zone travels a certain distance from the first tooth bud, a second tooth bud will start to develop. These two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive, nor does widely accepted dental science consider them to be so: it is postulated that both models influence tooth development at different times.",

It is known that modern mysticetes have teeth initially and then develop baleen plate germs \"in utero\", but lose their dentition and have only baleen during their juvenile years and adulthood. However, developing mysticetes do not produce tooth enamel because at some point this trait evolved to become a pseudogene. This is likely to have occurred about 28 million years ago and proves that dentition is an ancestral state of mysticetes. Using parsimony to study this and other ancestral characters suggest that the common ancestor of aetiocetids and edentulous mysticetes evolved lateral nutrient foramina, which are believed to have provided blood vessels and nerves a way to reach developing baleen. Further research suggests that the baleen of Aetiocetus was arranged in bundles between widely spaced teeth. If true, this combination of baleen and dentition in Aetiocetus would act as a transition state between odontocetes and mysticetes. This intermediate step is further supported by evidence of other changes that occurred with the evolution of baleen that make it possible for the organisms to survive using filter feeding, such as a change in skull structure and throat elasticity. It would be highly unlikely for all of these changes to occur at once. Therefore, it is proposed that Oligocene aetiocetids possess both ancestral and descendent character states regarding feeding strategies. This makes them mosaic taxa, showing that either baleen evolved before dentition was lost or that the traits for filter feeding originally evolved for other functions. It also shows that the evolution could have occurred gradually because the ancestral state was originally maintained. Therefore, the mosaic whales could have exploited new resources using filter feeding while not abandoning their previous prey strategies. The result of this stepwise transition is apparent in modern-day baleen whales, because of their enamel pseudogenes and their \"in utero\" development and reabsorbing of teeth.",

The tooth-whorl represented all the teeth produced by that individual in the lower jaw; as the individual grew, the older, smaller teeth were moved into the center of the whorl by larger, newer teeth appearing. Models of the \"Helicoprion\" tooth-whorl have been made. In the 1994 book \"Planet Ocean: A Story of Life, the Sea, and Dancing to the Fossil Record\", author Brad Matsen and artist Ray Troll describe and depict an example of such a model.

These differentiations with tooth length possibly correspond to different ecological niches being filled. The way the teeth are positioned inside the jaw is a unique feature of this species; with the teeth more apically being inserted within the alveolar bone and the fully developed teeth show dental ankylosis. From looking at the teeth and how they are positioned, it seems that the replacement pulse occurred anteroposteriorly in \"Stereosternum\", in a quasi-alternate polyphyodont pattern. Going more distally, the teeth seem to have periodontal ligaments connecting the teeth to the alveolar bone and then even more distally the tooth is connected by the anchorage trabeculae, which is composed of cementum and probably the alveolar bone. The anchorage trabeculae structure acts as an additional structure to hold the teeth in place. Within the adult teeth, the pulp cavity is enclosed within on itself, and inside those pulp cavities are canals that connect the tooth to the alveolar bone. Those canals were the spaces that were filled by blood vessels and nerves, which supplemented the growth of the tooth and gave the tooth some sensory abilities. During the early part of the development of the teeth, the roots would have been open, and the only connection that would have been facilitated would have been the cementum between the tooth and the alveolar bone, the periodontal ligament and the cementum made anchorage trabeculae would have mediated this connection. This complex, called the tripartite periodontium, during the life of \"Stereosternum\", would have acted as a mechanism for keeping the teeth within the jaw, working against the lateral forces that could easily pull teeth out of the socket, given the size of these teeth. The teeth also have multiple different types of dentine and there are different orientations of the dentine tubules along the tooth, including mixed composition in the dentary wall.

Teeth exhibit variables with a strong hereditary component that are useful in assessing population relationships and evolutionary dynamics. One example is shovel-shaped incisors, in which individuals have ridges on the inside margins of their front teeth. This trait is most common in East Asian and Native American populations and occurs less frequently elsewhere. Teeth have an important role in chewing food, and different dental pathologies and patterns of tooth wear can indicate kinds of food eaten and other dietary behaviors of certain populations. The measurement and examination of teeth can also exhibit incidental and intentional modifications which reflect the patterns of different cultural behaviors. The process of tooth formation is highly reflective of environment. Developmental defects observed on teeth can provide a general measure of environmental stress on a population.",

The teeth are even larger than those of the carnivorous therapsid \"Inostrancevia\", one of the largest members of Gorgonopsia, a group characterized by the presence of long canines. The large canines of \"Tiarajudens\" were likely used as a defense against predators or as a means of fighting for mates; living mammals such as the water deer and musk deer use their saber teeth for these purposes. The palatal teeth are broad and fit tightly together, an adaptation to consuming fibrous plants. This variation in tooth shape, known as a heterodont dentition, is common in mammals.

Tetrapod herbivores made their first appearance in the fossil record of their jaws near the Permio-Carboniferous boundary, approximately 300 million years ago. The earliest evidence of their herbivory has been attributed to dental occlusion, the process in which teeth from the upper jaw come in contact with teeth in the lower jaw is present. The evolution of dental occlusion led to a drastic increase in plant food processing and provides evidence about feeding strategies based on tooth wear patterns. Examination of phylogenetic frameworks of tooth and jaw morphologes has revealed that dental occlusion developed independently in several lineages tetrapod herbivores.

For the next 80 years they attracted relatively little interest, largely due to the difficulty of reaching the area. In the 1980s interest in the site resumed as four wheel drive vehicles became more readily available. Continuing interest coincided with the site being visited by fossil collectors, and many bones were removed, prompting calls for the site to be conserved. The remains display the typical streamlined body form of modern whales, yet retaining some of the primitive aspects of skull and tooth structure. The largest skeleton found reached up to 21 m in length, with well-developed five-fingered flippers on the forelimbs and the unexpected presence of hind legs, feet, and toes, not known previously in any archaeoceti. Their form was serpentine and they were carnivorous. A few of these skeletal remains are exposed but most are shallowly buried in sediments, slowly uncovered by erosion. Wadi El-Hitan provides evidences of millions of years of coastal marine life. Fossils are present in high numbers and often show excellent quality of preservation. The most conspicuous fossils are the skeletons and bones of whales and sea cows, and over several hundred fossils of these have been documented.  The fossils of whales vary from single bones to entire skeletons, and a number of partial skeletons are currently on display in the public part of the park. The two common whales are the large \"Basilosaurus\", and the smaller (3 to 5 metre) \"Dorudon.\" At least two other species are known from rarer remains. The whales possess small hind limbs, that are not seen in modern whales, and a powerful skull with teeth similar to those of carnivorous land mammals. Other mammals are represented by the skeletons of three species of sirenia or sea cows. These were fully marine like the whales, and likewise show primitive features not seen in modern species and possess teeth that suggest that they grazed on seagrasses and other marine plants. Bones of the primitive elephant \"Moeritherium\" have also been recorded.  Fossil reptiles are represented by fossils of crocodiles and sea turtles, and bones of sea snakes have also been recorded.  There are many species of bony fish, sharks and rays represented, but most of the fossils are isolated small teeth and these are not often conspicuous. Larger fish fossils include the rostra and pegs of sawfish; a sawfish rostrum of 1.8 metres long is laid out in the park.

            "document": "Microplasma . Scientists found that microplasmas are capable of inactivating bacteria that causes tooth decay and periodontal diseases. By directing low temperature microplasma beams at the calcified tissue structure beneath the tooth enamel coating called dentin, it severely reduces the amount of dental bacteria and in turn reduces infection. This aspect of microplasma could allow dentists to use microplasma technology to destroy bacteria in tooth cavities instead of using mechanical means. Developers claim that microplasma devices will enable dentists to effectively treat oral-borne diseases with little pain to their patients.  Recent studies show that microplasmas can be a very effective method of controlling oral biofilms. Biofilms (also known as slime) are highly organized, three-dimensional bacterial communities. Dental plaque is a common example of oral biofilms. It is the main cause of both tooth decay and periodontal diseases such as Gingivitis and Periodontitis. At the University of Southern California, Parish Sedghizadeh, Director of the USC Center for Biofilms and Chunqi Jiang, assistant research professor in the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering-Electrophysics, work with researchers from Viterbi School of Engineering searching for new ways to fight off these bacterial infections. Sedghizadeh explained that the biofilms\u2019 slimy matrix acts as extra protection against traditional antibiotics. However, the centers\u2019 study confirms that biofilms cultivated in the root canal of extracted human teeth can be easily destroyed by the application of microplasma. The plasma emission microscopy obtained during each experiment suggests that the atomic oxygen produced by the microplasma is responsible for the inactivation of bacteria. Sedghizadeh then suggested that the oxygen free radicals could disrupt the biofilms cellular membrane and cause them to break down. According to their ongoing research at USC, Sedghizadeh and Jiang have found that microplasma is not harmful to surrounding healthy tissues and they are confident that microplasma technology will soon become a groundbreaking tool in the medical industry.J.K. Lee along with other scientists in this field have found that microplasma can also be used for teeth bleaching. This reactive species can effectively bleach teeth along with saline or whitening gels that consist of hydrogen peroxide. Lee and his colleagues experimented with this method, examining how microplasma along with hydrogen peroxide effects blood stained human teeth. These scientists took forty extracted single-root, blood stained human teeth and randomly divided them into two groups of twenty. Group one received 30% hydrogen peroxide activated by microplasma for thirty minutes in a pulp chamber, while group two received 30% hydrogen peroxide alone for thirty minutes in the pulp chamber and the temperature was maintained at thirty seven degrees Celsius for both groups. After the tests had been performed, they found that microplasma treatment with 30% hydrogen peroxide had a significant effect on the whiteness of the teeth in group one. Lee and his associates concluded that the application of microplasma along with hydrogen peroxide is an efficient method in the bleaching of stained teeth due to its ability to remove proteins on the surface of teeth and the increased production of hydroxide.",

The snout is highly reduced relative to living crocodiles and accounts for less than half the total skull length. The snout is also narrow, less than 5\u00a0cm at its widest margin. The back portion of the skull is expanded and characterized by large orbits and fenestrae. The nares are located on the front-most portion of the skull. The premaxilla is mostly smooth, which stands in stark contrast to the other portions of the skull, and contains five teeth. Other skull bones are distinctly textured on their outside surfaces, including the maxillae, frontal, and parietal. Many of the cranial sutures are interdigitated, though to a lesser degree than \"A. tsangatsangana\". There is a distinct crest present on the frontal, which is located between the orbits. Lastly, the squamosal is triradiate when viewed dorsally and possess a distinct posterior process. This process is longer and oriented more dorsally than other species of \"Araripesuchus\". Unfortunately, the lower jaw of \"A. wegeneri\" is less well known, with only the dentary being well-preserved.  The teeth of \"A. wegeneri\" are unique and deserve special note. There are five premaxillary, 14 maxillary, and 16 dentary teeth. Sereno and Larsson (2009) assign three distinct functional types for these teeth: incisiforms, caniniforms, and postcaniniforms. Incisiform teeth have a bulbous base with an asymmetrical, recurved crown. The teeth also possess fine denticles. The crowns are often wrinkled and rounded. Caniniform teeth are distinguished by their size; they are larger than the surrounding teeth, but are otherwise similar in shape to incisiform teeth. Postcaniniforms are found behind the caniniform teeth and have a diverse range in shapes; they can be asymmetric, conical, or leaf-shaped. All premaxillary teeth are incisiform in shape and are approximately the same size. Maxillary teeth are more diverse. There are two incisiform, one caniniform, and 11 postcaniniform teeth, many of which display distinct patterns of wear. Dentary teeth follow the same basic pattern as maxillary teeth, with representatives of all forms being present. \"A. wegeneri\" dentition is unmistakably heterodont, possessing more than one morphology, and is therefore more similar to mammals than living crocodiles and their relatives. Additionally, the shape of many of these teeth is similar to prosauropod dinosaurs and living iguanas. This distinct tooth morphology and evidence for precise tooth to tooth occlusion suggests an omnivorous or herbivorous lifestyle. Unfortunately, tooth wear studies on these specimens have not been conducted and, therefore, have not confirmed this interpretation.",

Furthermore, this defensive spine is made up of semidentine odontodes, dermal bone, and perichondral bone suggesting that it is derived from dermal plates.",

The dermal skeleton is just surface dentin and basal bone, which is sometimes overlaid by enameloid. It is thought that the dermal skeleton eventually became scales, which are homologous to teeth. Teeth were first seen in chondrichthyans and were made from all three components of the dermal skeleton, namely dentin, basal bone and enameloid. The mineralization mechanism of mammalian tissue was later elaborated in actinopterygians and sarcopterygians during bony fish evolution. It is expected that genetic analysis of agnathans will provide more insight into the evolution of mineralized tissues and clarify evidence from early fossil records.",
