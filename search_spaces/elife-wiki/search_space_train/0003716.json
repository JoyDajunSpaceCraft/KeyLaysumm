            "document": "Bacterial circadian rhythm . In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria that \"resonate\" with the environmental circadian rhythm. [6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

The gut flora has also been implicated in obesity and metabolic syndrome due to the key role it plays in the digestive process; the Western pattern diet appears to drive and maintain changes in the gut flora that in turn change how much energy is derived from food and how that energy is used. One aspect of a healthy diet that is often lacking in the Western-pattern diet is fiber and other complex carbohydrates that a healthy gut flora require flourishing; changes to gut flora in response to a Western-pattern diet appear to increase the amount of energy generated by the gut flora which may contribute to obesity and metabolic syndrome. There is also evidence that microbiota influence eating behaviours based on the preferences of the microbiota, which can lead to the host consuming more food eventually resulting in obesity. It has generally been observed that with higher gut microbiome diversity, the microbiota will spend energy and resources on competing with other microbiota and less on manipulating the host. The opposite is seen with lower gut microbiome diversity, and these microbiotas may work together to create host food cravings.",

A study which assessed the oral and gut microbes before, immediately after, and up to 12 months after exposure to antibiotics, found that the microbiome can be altered for over 12 months.

From around 2005 on, the scientific community has thoroughly developed the concept of human microbiome and begun the systematic study to establish the relationship between the microbiome and human physiology in health and disease. We begin to understand that gut microbiota helps modulating host immunity at a systemic level. However, gut microbiome does not affect skin immunity significantly, instead, skin immunity is modulated by skin microflora according to the results obtained by Naik et al. Analyzing immunologic changes of germ-free (GF) mice with reconstituted gut microbiota showed a recovery of Il-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels up to those observed in the gastrointestinal tract of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice but gut microbiome restoration did not affect skin immunity. Comparing GF and SPF mice showed a decrease in the skin production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A. To evaluate the functional consequences of the absence of skin microbiota Leishmania major was introduced intradermally and the lesions were evaluated. L. major lesions in GF mice were significantly smaller and less severe than in SPF mice, however, the number of parasites after infection was significantly higher in GF mice. These results cearly indicate that GF mice have an impaired capacity of response in front of infections compared to SPF mice. Finally, mono-association of GF mice with \"S. epidermidis\" clearly restored immunity function which in the case of skin is mediated by IL-1 which is key for the restoration of IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Thus skin commensals exert their effect by enhancing IL-1 signaling and amplifying responses according to local inflammatory milieu. As IL-1 has been implicated in the etiology and pathology of psoriasis and other cutaneous disorders, it is likely that skin commensals are important drivers and amplifiers of skin pathologies.",

            "document": "Effective evolutionary time . A considerable number of recent studies support the hypothesis. Thus, diversity of marine benthos, interrupted by some collapses and plateaus, has risen from the Cambrian to the Recent, and there is no evidence that saturation has been reached. Rates of diversification per time unit for birds and butterflies increase towards the tropics. Allen et al. found a general correlation between environmental temperature and species richness for North and Central American trees, for amphibians, fish, Prosobranchia and fish parasites. They showed that species richness can be predicted from the biochemical kinetics of metabolism, and concluded that evolutionary rates are determined by generation times and mutation rates both correlated with metabolic rates which have the same Boltzmann relation with temperature. They further concluded that these findings support the mechanisms for latitudinal gradients proposed by Rohde. Gillooly et al. (2002) described a general model also based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics which makes predictions about generation times as a function of body size and temperature. Empirical findings support the predictions: in all cases that were investigated (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic insects, zooplankton) generation times are negatively correlated with temperature. Brown et al.(2004) further developed these findings to a general metabolic theory of ecology. Indirect evidence points to increased mutation rates at higher temperatures, and the energy-speciation hypothesis is the best predictor for species richness of ants. Finally, computer simulations using the Chowdhury eosystem model have shown that results correspond most closely to empirical data when the number of vacant niches is kept large. Rohde gives detailed discussions of these and other examples. Of particular importance is the study by Wright et al. (2006) which was specifically designed to test the hypothesis. It showed that molecular substitution rates of tropical woody plants are more than twice as large as those of temperate species, and that more effective genetic drift in smaller tropical populations cannot be responsible for the differences, leaving only direct temperature effects on mutation rates as an explanation. Gillman et al. (2009) examined 260 mammal species of 10 orders and 29 families and found that substitution rates in the cytochrome B gene were substantially faster in species at warm latitudes and elevations, compared with those from cold latitudes and elevations. A critical examination of the data showed that this cannot be attributed to gene drift or body mass differentials. The only possibilities left are a Red Queen effect or direct effects of thermal gradients (including possibly an effect of torpor/hibernation differentials). Rohde (1992, 1978) had already pointed out that \u201cit may well be that mammalian diversity is entirely determined by the diversity of plants and poikilothermic animals further down in the hierarchy\u201d, i.e., by a Red Queen effect. He also pointed out that exposure to irradiation including light is known to cause mutations in mammals, and that some homoiothermic animals have shorter generation times in the tropics, which - either separately or jointly - may explain the effect found by Gillman et al. Gillman et al. (2010) extended their earlier study on plants by determining whether the effect is also found within highly conserved DNA. They examined the 18S ribosomal gene in the same 45 pairs of plants. And indeed, the rate of evolution was 51% faster in the tropical than their temperate sister species. Furthermore, the substitution rate in 18S correlated positively with that in the more variable ITS. These result lend further very strong support to the hypothesis. Wright et al. (2010) tested the hypothesis on 188 species of amphibians belonging to 18 families, using mitochondrial RNA genes 12S and 16S, and found substantially faster substitution rates for species living in warmer habitats at both lower latitudes and lower elevations. Thus, the hypothesis has now been confirmed for several genes and for plants and animals.",

These slugs prefer to eat on cloudy days or at night when temperatures are above 10 degrees Celsius. Mucus-production necessitates moist habitats, such as among leaf-litter, mosses, or fallen trees. Consequently, the black slug becomes most active after rainfall. A 1976 study compared black slug assimilation rates to that of similar slugs in the UK. The study determined the black slug feeds at similar rates to other European slugs (in terms of biomass), suggesting the black slug is an equally important decomposer/consumer in forest systems. The study theorized these high assimilation rates might result from abundant enzymes in slug digestive systems: amylase, invertase, cellulase, xylanase, and chitinase. The last might be especially indicative of how these slugs can consume large quantities of fungi such as \"Armillaria mellea\". Microbiota within black slug digestive systems produce these enzymes\u2014such as the bacteria that produce cellulose\u2014enabling the slugs to break down lignocellulose. A recent study further explored \"Arion ater\"\u2019s gut microbiome and discovered the black slug to have far more bacteria within its gut than did neighboring, northern European insects, including members of the orders \"Coleoptera, Isoptera, Orthoptera\", and \"Diptera\". This study learned the black slug\u2019s gut microbiome to be functional at a wide range of temperatures and pH levels, and its results suggest that the mycobacterial culture may be uniform throughout the black slug\u2019s gut and that \"Gammaproteobacteria\" composes most of this culture. This study contrasted its results to studies of North American black slugs that presented higher levels of cellulolytic activity at a narrower pH range. In summary, \"Arion ater\" can digest diverse food material such as cellulose because gut bacteria produce digestive enzymes.",

There is some indication of relationships between milk microbiota and other human milk components, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), maternal cells, and nutrient profiles. Specific bacterial genera have been shown to be associated with variation in levels of milk macronutrients such as lactose, proteins, and fats. HMOs selectively facilitate growth of particular beneficial bacteria, notably \"Bifidobacterium\" species. Furthermore, as bifidobacterial genomes are uniquely equipped to metabolize HMOs, which are otherwise indigestible by enzymes of the infant gut, some have suggested a coevolutionary dynamic between HMOs and certain bacteria common in both the milk and infant gastrointestinal microbiomes. Furthermore, relative to other mammalian milks, primate milk, particularly human milk, appears to be unique with respect to the complexity and diversity of its oligosaccharide repertoire. Human milk is typified by greater overall HMO diversity and predominance of oligosaccharides known to promote growth of \"Bifidobacterium\" in the infant gut. Milk microbiota are thought to play an essential role in programming the infant immune system, and tend to reduce the risk of adverse infant health outcomes. Differences in milk oligosaccharides between humans and non-human primates could be indicative of variation in pathogen exposure associated with increased sociality and group sizes. Together, these observations may indicate that milk microbial communities have coevolved with their human host, supported by the expectation that microbes which promote host health facilitate their own transmission and proliferation.",

In contrast to this, anoles can change rapidly in response to changes and they are one of the few known examples if \"visible evolution\" (i.e., where changes happen at a speed where they can be observed within a human lifetime), together with groups like stickleback fish, guppies and \"Peromyscus\" beach mice. In studies of brown anoles introduced to Florida it has been seen that they can become longer-legged in a single generation when living with the predatory, ground-living northern curly-tailed lizard (shorter-legged anoles are slower and easier to catch for the curly-tailed lizard). Over a longer period, however, their legs become shorter, which are better suited for perching on smaller branches higher off the ground, out of reach for the curly-tailed lizard. When brown anoles are introduced to small islands with low vegetation, their legs become shorter, better suited for rapidly moving among the shrunken shrubbery to catch insects and avoid predatory birds. Furthermore, in a study where brown anoles were introduced to seven small, anole-free Bahaman islands (anoles had disappeared because of Hurricane Frances), it was seen that\u2014although all populations became shorter-legged within a few years\u2014this was proportional to the leg-size of the founders. In other words: The few founder brown anoles introduced to one island were shorter-legged than the few introduced to another. Both populations became shorter-legged over time, but the first remained shorter-legged than the second. This is an example of the founder effect. Similarly, when brown anoles were introduced to Florida, the native Carolina (or green) anoles moved to higher perches and gained larger toe pads better suited for those perches. This adaptation occurred in just 20 generations. Anoles are also adapting to life with humans: Puerto Rican crested anoles living in cities have developed more adhesive lamellae on their toe pads than ones living in forests, reflecting the need for being able to climb very smooth surfaces like windows in the former habitat. In contrast to these fast changes, anole's adaptability to temperature changes has traditionally been considered relatively minor. Nevertheless, when Puerto Rican crested anoles in Florida (where introduced in the 1970s) were compared to the original, native population in Puerto Rico, it was discovered that the former had become adapted to colder temperatures, by about 3\u00a0\u00b0C (5.4\u00a0\u00b0F). An even faster adaption was observed in Carolina anoles from Texas during the unusually cold winter of 2013\u20132014. Carolina anoles living in central Texas and further north were already adapted to relatively cold temperatures, but those of southern Texas were not. However, after the winter of 2013\u20132014, the cold tolerance of the southern Texan populations had increased by as much as 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C (2.7\u00a0\u00b0F) and their genomic profiles had changed to more closely resemble the more northerly living Carolina anoles.",

            "document": "Bacterial circadian rhythm . In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria that \"resonate\" with the environmental circadian rhythm. [6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

The changes in membrane lipid composition lead to a higher membrane fluidity, thus keeping the membrane from \"freezing\" at low temperatures.

            "document": "Cold hardening . Plants in temperate and polar regions adapt to winter and sub zero temperatures by relocating nutrients from leaves and shoots to storage organs. Freezing temperatures induce dehydrative stress on plants, as water absorption in the root and water transport in the plant decreases. Water in and between cells in the plant freezes and expands, causing tissue damage. Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate cellular injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures. Non-acclimatized individuals can survive \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C, while a acclimatized individual in the same species can survive \u221230\u00b0. Plants that originated in the tropics, like tomato or maize, don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures. The plant starts the adaptation by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the signal to activate or repress expression of appropriate genes. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the stress, caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living cells. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature stress are shared with other abiotic stresses, like drought or salinity.When temperature drops, the membrane fluidity, RNA and DNA stability, and enzyme activity change. These, in turn, affect transcription, translation, intermediate metabolism, and photosynthesis, leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on \"arabidopsis\" show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the absolute temperature. The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of calcium influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. Calcium channels in the cell membrane detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in \"alfalfa\" and \"arabidopsis\". The response to the change in calcium elevation depends on the cell type and stress history. Shoot tissue will respond more than a root cells, and a cell that already is adapted to cold stress will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn't control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of reactive oxygen species and excitation of photosystem 2, which influences low-temp signal transduction mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation.",

Variation in the hologenome may encode phenotypic plasticity of the holobiont and can be subject to evolutionary changes caused by selection and drift, if portions of the hologenome are transmitted between generations with reasonable fidelity. One of the important outcomes of recasting the individual as a holobiont subject to evolutionary forces is that genetic variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in the host genome and also by changes in the microbiome, including new acquisitions of microbes, horizontal gene transfers, and changes in microbial abundance within hosts. Although there is a rich literature on binary host\u2013microbe symbioses, the hologenome concept distinguishes itself by including the vast symbiotic complexity inherent in many multicellular hosts.

Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as various extinct related groups. Most fish are ectothermic (\"cold-blooded\"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). At 32,000 species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.",

            "document": "Hypoxia in fish . The crucian carp is one species able to remodel its gill filaments in response to hypoxia. Their inter-lamellar cells have high rates of mitotic activity which are influenced by both hypoxia and temperature. In cold (15\u00a0\u00b0C) water the crucian carp has more ILCM, but when the temperature is increased to 25\u00a0\u00b0C the ILCM is removed, just as it would be in hypoxic conditions. This same transition in gill morphology occurs in the goldfish when the temperature was raised from 7.5\u00a0\u00b0C to 15\u00a0\u00b0C. This difference may be due to the temperature regimes that these fish are typically found in, or there could be an underlying protective mechanism to prevent a loss of ion balance in stressful temperatures. Temperature also affects the speed at which the gills can be remodelled: for example, at 20\u00a0\u00b0C in hypoxia, the crucian carp can completely remove its ILCM in 6 hours, whereas at 8\u00a0\u00b0C, the same process takes 3\u20137 days. The ILCM is likely removed by apoptosis, but it is possible that when the fish is faced with the double stress of hypoxia at high temperature, the lamellae may be lost by physical degradation. Covering the gill lamellae may protect species like the crucian carp from parasites and environmental toxins during normoxia by limiting their surface area for inward diffusion while still maintaining oxygen transport due to an extremely high hemoglobin oxygen binding affinity.",

Rosenberg\u2019s early work in Israel focused on myxobacteriology, hydrocarbon microbiology, surface-active polymers from Acinetobacter, and bioremediation. In collaboration with his department colleagues Eliora Z. Ron and David Gutnik, he introduced the pioneering use of microorganisms and bioemulsifiers to treat oil pollution in oil tankers, pipelines and on beaches In later years he collaborated with Yossi Loya (Zoology Dept., Tel Aviv University) to research coral disease. They demonstrated for the first time that coral bleaching is the result of an infectious disease and that a rise in temperature due to global warming causes pathogenic micro organisms to be more active and cause infectious epidemic diseases. His most recent work has developed the \"hologenome concept of evolution\" (together with Ilana Zilber-Rosenberg). This groundbreaking concept posits that the holobiont (host plus all of its associated microorganisms) and its hologenome (sum of the genetic information of the host and its symbiotic microorganisms), function as a unique biological entity and therefore as a level of selection in evolution. According to the hologenome concept microbial symbionts and the host interact in a cooperative way that affects the health of the holobiont within its environment, and the sum of these cooperative interactions characterizes the holobiont as a unique biological entity. He contends that under environmental stress, the microbiome can change more rapidly and in response to more processes than the host organism alone and thus influences the evolution of the holobiont. Prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and phage therapy are conceived as applied aspects of the hologenome concept.",

Due to advection or attachment to sinking particles, microbes from the surface of the ocean are continuously transported to deeper areas. The vast majority of the marine environment consists of dark, cold, high-pressure environments, which increases with depth. When cultures of \"Neobodo\" were isolated from surface waters and were put in different deep-sea temperatures and pressures, the abundance of protists declined in all treatments, with a significantly greater rate of mortality under combined cold temperature and high pressure conditions than in the cold temperature-only conditions. However, an average of 6.1% of \"N. designis\" cells survived in the high pressure treatments, indicating that some fraction of sinking protists can survive transport to the deep ocean. In addition, after a period of acclimation, positive growth rates were measured in some cases. This suggests that surface-adapted flagellates can not only survive under deep-sea conditions but are able to reproduce and potentially provide seed populations in cold, high-pressure environments. Although \"Neobodo\" are not abundant in the deep oceans, they are capable of surviving in the deep waters, tolerating high pressure and low temperature conditions.",

A drop in temperature will lower this number and physiological functions can come to a standstill. This is how an extreme drop in temperature can result in the eventual collapse of physiological functioning and eventual death of an animal. Ectotherms are unable to survive in extremely cold temperatures (around 0.7 degrees Celsius) as their internal body temperature must match the outside temperature and cannot handle very cold temperatures. However, this can be dealt with in a few different ways, and one such way is the changing of actual lipid conformation and composition. This adaptation will cause a rise in fluidity and a higher physical tolerance of the cells undergoing this temperature change.",

            "document": "Eurytherm . In addition to other organisms, plants (Plantae) can be either stenothermic or eurythermic. Plants inhabiting the boreal and polar climates generally tend to be cold-eurythermic, enduring temperatures as cold as \u201385\u00b0, and as warm as at least 20\u00a0\u00b0C, such as boreal deciduous conifers. This is in direct contrast to plants that typically inhabit more tropical or montane regions, where plants may have purely tolerable range between only about 10\u00b0 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, such as the banyan tree. The tolerance for extreme body temperatures in a given eurythermic organism is largely due to an increased temperature tolerance by the respective organism's homologous proteins. In particular, the proteins of a warm-adapted species may be inherently more eurythermal than a cold-adapted species, with warm-adapted species' proteins withstanding higher temperatures before beginning to denature, therefore avoiding possible cell death. Eurythermal species also have shown adaptations in protein synthesis rates compared to non-eurythermal similar species. Rainbow trout\"(Salmo gairdneri\") have shown constant protein synthesis rates formula_1 over temperatures ranging from 5\u00b0 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C, after acclimating to any temperature in this range for 1 month. In contrast, carp (C\"yprinus carpio\"\")\" have shown significantly higher protein synthesis rates after acclimating to higher water temperatures (25\u00a0\u00b0C) than after acclimating to lower water temperatures (10\u00a0\u00b0C). This type of experiment is common throughout fish. A similar example is given by the Senegalese sole (\"Solea senegalensis\"), which, when acclimated to temperatures of 26\u00a0\u00b0C, produced a significantly higher amount of taurine, glutamate, GABA and glycine compared to acclimation to 12\u00a0\u00b0C.

From around 2005 on, the scientific community has thoroughly developed the concept of human microbiome and begun the systematic study to establish the relationship between the microbiome and human physiology in health and disease. We begin to understand that gut microbiota helps modulating host immunity at a systemic level. However, gut microbiome does not affect skin immunity significantly, instead, skin immunity is modulated by skin microflora according to the results obtained by Naik et al. Analyzing immunologic changes of germ-free (GF) mice with reconstituted gut microbiota showed a recovery of Il-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels up to those observed in the gastrointestinal tract of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice but gut microbiome restoration did not affect skin immunity. Comparing GF and SPF mice showed a decrease in the skin production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A. To evaluate the functional consequences of the absence of skin microbiota Leishmania major was introduced intradermally and the lesions were evaluated. L. major lesions in GF mice were significantly smaller and less severe than in SPF mice, however, the number of parasites after infection was significantly higher in GF mice. These results cearly indicate that GF mice have an impaired capacity of response in front of infections compared to SPF mice. Finally, mono-association of GF mice with \"S. epidermidis\" clearly restored immunity function which in the case of skin is mediated by IL-1 which is key for the restoration of IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Thus skin commensals exert their effect by enhancing IL-1 signaling and amplifying responses according to local inflammatory milieu. As IL-1 has been implicated in the etiology and pathology of psoriasis and other cutaneous disorders, it is likely that skin commensals are important drivers and amplifiers of skin pathologies.",
