In fruit fly (\"Drosophila melanogaster\"), atlastin-1 has been shown to induce tethering and fusion of membranes adjacent to the ER to help maintain the integrity of the ER. The function of atlastin-1 is crucially dependent on its GTPase activity. In humans, a HSAN ID-associated mutation caused significant loss of the GTPase activity of the enzyme, leading to prominent disruption of ER network. In addition to maintaining the integrity of the ER, atlastin-1 also has neuron-related functions. The enzyme is implicated in the trafficking and signaling of type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors in zebra fish (\"Danio rerio\"). BMP signaling is involved in axon guidance and synapse formation, as well as axonal transport and the organization of the microtubule network in developing neurons. The signaling is disturbed in several neurodegenerative disorders. It also regulates membrane dynamics in the neuronal growth cone in rat.",

Historically, mammalian neurofilaments were originally thought to be composed of just three proteins called neurofilament protein L (low molecular weight; NFL), M (medium molecular weight; NFM) and H (high molecular weight; NFH). These proteins were discovered from studies of axonal transport and are often referred to as the \"neurofilament triplet\". However, it is now clear that neurofilaments in the mammalian nervous system also contain the protein internexin and that neurofilaments in the peripheral nervous system can also contain the protein peripherin. Thus mammalian neurofilaments are heteropolymers of up to five different proteins: NFL, NFM, NFH, internexin and peripherin and it is incorrect to consider neurofilaments as being composed of just the neurofilament triplet proteins. Moreover, it is clear that the five neurofilament proteins can coassemble in different combinations and with variable stoichiometry in different nerve cell types and at different stages of development. The precise composition of neurofilaments in any given nerve cell depends on the relative expression levels of the neurofilament proteins in that cell at that time. For example, NFH expression is low in developing neurons and increases postnatally in neurons that are myelinated. In the adult nervous system neurofilaments in small unmyelinated axons contain more peripherin and less NFH whereas neurofilaments in large myelinated axons contain more NFH and less peripherin. The Class III intermediate filament subunit, vimentin, is expressed in developing neurons and a few very unusual neurons in the adult in association with Class IV proteins, such as the horizontal neurons of the retina.",

A neurite outgrowth assay is a type of experiment where neurons are placed on different adhesive substrates on tissue culture plates. A neurite outgrowth assay is meant to mimic how neurons grow inside the body. During development of the nervous system, neuronal axons reach their often-distant targets by reacting to different substrates in their environment, so-called guidance cues, that are attractive, repulsive or simply permissive, meaning these substrates pull axons toward them, away from them, or act in a way that allows growth, respectively. When PTPmu is applied to a dish as an \u2018\u2019in vitro\u2019\u2019 substrate, it promotes neurite outgrowth.

All of them have paired hydrophobic segments but the first domain of that kind is much shorter in REEP 1 to 4. Besides, REEP 5 and 6 have a clear cytoplasmic segment and a shorter C-terminal region. As for Yop1p, its structure is closer to that of REEP 5 and 6. These structural differences are closely related to the proteins' functions, that differ slightly between them.

Like classical cadherins, members of Pcdhs family were also shown to mediate cell-cell adhesion in cell-based assays and most of them showed to engage in homophilic trans-interactions.  Schreiner and Weiner showed that Pcdh\u03b1 and \u03b3 proteins can form multimeric complexes. If all three classes of Pcdhs could engage in multimerization of stochastically expressed Pcdhs isoforms, then neurons could produce a large number of distinct homophilic interaction units, amplifying significantly the cell-surface diversity more than the one afforded by stochastic gene expression alone. As for cytoplasmic domain, all the three classes of clustered Pcdhs proteins are dissimilar, although they are strictly conserved in vertebrate evolution, suggesting a conserved cellular function. This is corroborated by a large number of other interacting proteins including phosphatases, kinases, adhesion molecules and synaptic proteins The cytoplasmic domain also mediates intracellular retention, a property which distinguishes the clustered protocadherins from the related classical cadherins. Furthermore, it was shown that Pcdhs are proteolitically processed by \u03b3-secretase complex, which releases soluble intracellular fragments into the cytoplasm which might have a broad range of functions as acting locally in the cytoplasm and/or even regulate gene expression similarly to other cell-surface proteins such as Notch and N-cadherin.  Since these molecules are involved in so many developmental processes like axon guidance and dendrite ariborization, mutations in Pcdhs genes and their expression may play a role in Down, Rett as well as Fragile X syndrome, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases",

Dysfunctional axonal transport is also linked to sporadic (common) forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This is mainly due to numerous observations that large axonal accumulations are invariably seen in affected neurons, and that genes known to play a role in the familial forms of these diseases also have purported roles in normal axonal transport.

Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The depolymerization of microtubules occurs and is soon followed by degradation of the neurofilaments and other cytoskeleton components. The disintegration is dependent on Ubiquitin and Calpain proteases (caused by influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process and not a passive one as previously misunderstood. Thus the axon undergoes complete fragmentation. The rate of degradation is dependent on the type of injury and is also slower in the CNS than in the PNS. Another factor that affects degradation rate is the diameter of the axon: larger axons require a longer time for the cytoskeleton to degrade and thus take a longer time to degenerate.",

XMAP215/Dis1 family proteins promote both growth and reduction of microtubule length, depending on the concentration of free tubulin; this is known as dynamic instability. Protein behavior is also cell-cycle dependent. Reducing ch-TOG expression leads to improper alignment of the chromosomes during metaphase. One study suggests that in \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\", the protein Cdc2 regulates Dis1 through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during metaphase and anaphase. Phosphorylating Dis1 leads to localization at the kinetochores during metaphase, whereas dephosphorylation during anaphase leads to an accumulation of Dis1 on microtubule spindles. In \"Drosophila\", the family member Mini spindles (Msps) is essential for maintaining the integrity of mitotic spindles, which are important for separating chromosomes during mitosis. Reducing Msps activity creates short microtubules, which describes the name of the gene. Msps is also important during oogenesis. When oocytes are depleted of Msps expression, bicoid mRNA localization is less efficient during early stages of oogenesis, but then completely dispersed later in development. Msps is not only responsible for transporting bicoid mRNA throughout the cell, but it also localizes mRNA to the anterior (head) end of the oocyte Additionally, this gene is critical for the organization of tubular endoplasmic reticulum and in Exuperantia protein localization. Exuperantia is necessary for accumulating bicoid mRNA in the head region of the oocyte. Another key function of XMAP215 in microtubule dynamics is in the regulation of axon guidance. This is when microtubules extend into or retract from the axonal growth cone, which guides movement by receiving concentrated signaling cues. In \"Drosophila\", Msps promotes microtubule dynamics in axonal guidance at the embryonic ventral nerve cord midline.",

In examining the cells, the tubular outline becomes more pronounced. In axons, similar effects can be seen. There is swelling in mitochondria and other membrane bound organelles.

The surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated RER or Rough ER) (also called \"granular endoplasmic reticulum\") is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a \"rough\" appearance (hence its name). The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon. However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway. The first 5\u201330 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.",

In cases of polyneuropathy, many nerve cells in various parts of the body are affected, without regard to the nerve through which they pass; not all nerve cells are affected in any particular case. In distal axonopathy, one common pattern is that the cell bodies of neurons remain intact, but the axons are affected in proportion to their length; the longest axons are the most affected. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of this pattern. In demyelinating polyneuropathies, the myelin sheath around axons is damaged, which affects the ability of the axons to conduct electrical impulses. The third and least common pattern affects the cell bodies of neurons directly. This usually picks out either the motor neurons (known as motor neuron disease) or the sensory neurons (known as \"sensory neuronopathy\" or \"dorsal root ganglionopathy\").",

The main function of the SEC23A protein is to hydrolyze or break down a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecule bound to the SAR1A protein at the start of the COPII pathway. The energy released from the breaking of the GTP bond provides energy necessary to undergo another reaction. This triggers uncoating of the vesicle (a membrane bound carrying compartment for molecules) containing a secretory protein destined for packaging in the Golgi apparatus of the cell. Uncoating the vesicle exposes SNARE proteins which are needed for the vesicle to bind to the membrane site on the endoplasmic reticulum. A mutation in the SEC23A gene prevents the vesicle from uncoating so it will not bind to the receptor site on the endoplasmic reticulum to be released into the cytoplasm for transport to the Golgi apparatus. Thus, the vesicles will accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing it to become enlarged or distended. Ultimately, this causes the craniofacial symptoms present in patients with CLSD. This is probably due to abnormal secretion of collagen and possibly other secretory proteins which have accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. Collagen is responsible to for skull ossification, among other things.",

The highly dynamic nature of growth cones allows them to respond to the surrounding environment by rapidly changing direction and branching in response to various stimuli. There are three stages of axon outgrowth, which are termed: protrusion, engorgement, and consolidation. During protrusion, there is a rapid extension of filopodia and lamellar extensions along the leading edge of the growth cone. Engorgement follows when the filopodia move to the lateral edges of the growth cone, and microtubules invade further into the growth cone, bringing vesicles and organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, consolidation occurs when the F-actin at the neck of the growth cone depolymerizes and the filopodia retract. The membrane then shrinks to form a cylindrical axon shaft around the bundle of microtubules. One form of axon branching also occurs via the same process, except that the growth cone \u201csplits\u201d during the engorgement phase. This results in the bifurcation of the main axon. An additional form of axon branching is termed collateral (or interstitial) branching;.Collateral branching, unlike axon bifurcations, involves the formation of a new branch from the established axon shaft and is independent of the growth cone at the tip of the growing axon. In this mechanism, the axon initially generates a filopodium or lamellipodium which following invasion by axonal microtubules can then develop further into a branch extending perpendicular from the axon shaft. Established collateral branches, like the main axon, exhibit a growth cone and develop independently of the main axon tip.",
