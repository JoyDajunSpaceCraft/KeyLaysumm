Nests represent a highly concentrated supply of resources, which makes them desirable to predators. \"P. colobopterus\" wasps have a nonaggressive response when their nest is disturbed. After the initial provocation, wasps leave the nest and begin vigorous displays on its outer envelope. If the provocation continues, females will abandon the nest entirely, leaving the offspring behind. This unique behavior is particularly interesting because the females possess stings that could be used in colony defense. However, field observations indicate females will only sting in self-defense if directly attacked. There have been several theories proposed for the defense response of \"P. colobopterus\", but it seems most likely that this response is due to the lack of vertebrate predation. Furthermore, the nests of these wasps are camouflaged by plant matter, which may further reduce the likelihood of vertebrate predation and negate the need for aggressive defense.",

The different ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.",

During lactation in prey species, including cattle, a reduction in fear responsiveness of the dam to novel and potentially dangerous situations facilitates the expression of defensive aggression in protection of the young.

Supplementing the adrenalectamized mother with corticosterone, rescued the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis response to maternal stress for prenatally stressed offspring. Prenatal stress caused high glucocorticoids, which in turn affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis negative feedback. A study by Garc\u00eda-C\u00e1ceres et al. showed that prenatal stress decreases cell turnover and proliferation in the hypothalamus of adult rats, which reduces structural plasticity and reduces the response to stress in adulthood. This study also showed that when prenatally stressed rats were stressed in adulthood the females showed an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone suggesting it to be an up-regulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. Males showed no elevation of corticosterone levels.

            "document": "Predatory imminence continuum . Post-encounter defensive behaviours are avoidance behaviours performed when a predator is present and has been detected. When this stage of threat has been reached, behaviours are limited to species-specific defence reactions. These behaviours are commonly freezing, fleeing or threatening. The goal of a post-encounter defensive behaviour is to prevent the predatory imminence from further increasing. The dominant post-encounter defensive behaviour can depend on whether the predator has also detected the prey and how far away the two animals are from one another. Varying levels of predatory imminence, even in post-encounter situations, can affect the expressed defensive behaviour. If the prey has yet to be detected, the goal of the post-encounter behaviour will be to prevent the predator from detecting the prey. If both the predator and prey have detected each other, the goal will be to avoid making contact with the predator. Freezing behaviour in rats is an example of a post-encounter defensive behaviour which has been well studied. Freezing in rats is characterized by sudden, extended immobility, followed by a decreased heart rate and an increased respiration rate. This behaviour is often the dominant post-encounter defence behaviour in rats. In the laboratory setting, post-encounter defensive behaviours can be elicited by pairing a neutral stimulus, such as a light, with an aversive stimulus, such as a shock. The rat will engage in its post-encounter defensive behaviour when it becomes aware of the neutral stimulus, as the stimulus is acting as a predictor for the shock. Since the freezing behaviour is dominant in these situations, it can be assumed that it serves an adaptive function by preventing an additional increase in predatory imminence. Freezing is the dominant post-encounter behaviour because even when there are alternative defensive reactions available, freezing has been observed to be the rat's response the majority of the time. Even when a clear method of escape was made available, rats would freeze instead of fleeing. Freezing can prevent the perceived level of threat from increasing in several ways. If a rat becomes aware of a predator before the predator is aware of the prey, freezing can reduce the likelihood that the prey will be detected. As well, since many predators rely on motion to keep track of their prey, freezing may cause the predator to either lose site of their prey or shift their attention to a more active object.",

Mothers defend their offspring against predators as they mature by moving towards the threat and fanning their wings. Experiments show that without this protection their progeny have only a 3% survival rate in the wild. Further observation has shown that guarding eggs and protecting offspring after they hatch has a significant cost to the mother, reducing her future reproductive potential in terms of fecundity and clutch number. Evolutionary theory predicts that parental investment should change depending on the reproductive value of offspring and future reproductive potential of parents. Douglas Tallamy found that maternal defensive behaviour in this species is consistent with the theory, since mothers became more aggressive in their clutch defense as they got older (less future reproduction at risk) and as the nymphs in each clutch matured (greater investment lost/higher survival potential as they get bigger). Because of heavy predation, this investment is necessary. However, females can reduce costs to themselves by laying in the egg masses of conspecifics (\"i.e.\" other mothers) who will then take care of their offspring for them (similar behaviour occurs in other species; see brood parasite). This exploitation of other females is common; eggs are laid in neighbouring egg masses whenever there is opportunity to do so. Egg dumpers were observed to have higher mortality rates per egg, but were at an advantage because they were more fecund (could lay more eggs) and were at lower risk of predation.",

Further, decreased DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene were found in offspring that experienced a high level of licking; the glucorticoid receptor plays a key role in regulating the HPA. The opposite is found in offspring that experienced low levels of licking, and when pups are switched, the epigenetic changes are reversed. This research provides evidence for an underlying epigenetic mechanism. Further support comes from experiments with the same setup, using drugs that can increase or decrease methylation.

Habituation has been observed in an enormously wide range of species from motile single-celled organisms such as the amoeba and \"Stentor coeruleus\" to sea slugs to humans. Habituation processes are adaptive, allowing animals to adjust their innate behaviors to changes in their natural world. A natural animal instinct, for example, is to protect themselves and their territory from any danger and potential predators. It is obvious that an animal needs to respond quickly to the sudden appearance of a predator. What may be less obvious is the importance of defensive responses to the sudden appearance of any new, unfamiliar stimulus, whether it is dangerous or not. An initial defensive response to a new stimulus is important because if an animal fails to respond to a potentially dangerous unknown stimulus, the results could be deadly. Despite this initial, innate defensive response to an unfamiliar stimulus, the response becomes habituated if the stimulus repeatedly occurs but causes no harm. An example of this is the prairie dog habituating to humans. Prairie dogs give alarm calls when they detect a potentially dangerous stimulus. This defensive call occurs when any mammal, snake, or large bird approaches them. However, they habituate to noises, such as human footsteps, that occur repeatedly but result in no harm to them. If prairie dogs never habituate to nonthreatening stimuli, they would be constantly sending out alarm calls and wasting their time and energy. However, the habituation process in prairie dogs may depend on several factors including the particular defensive response. In one study that measured several different responses to the repeated presence of humans, the alarm calls of prairie dogs showed habituation whereas the behavior of escaping into their burrows showed sensitization.",

If the nest is on open terrain, the parent may perceive predators at a greater distance and be able to leave the nest and begin displaying before the predator is in sufficient proximity to locate the nest. Furthermore, if the nest is on or near the ground, the parent may be able to display more effectively; Armstrong noted the relative rarity in the literature of distraction display in arboreal-nesting species, and attributed this to the difficulty of displaying convincingly while on a branch. Nonetheless, there have been anecdotal reports of warblers, which nest arboreally, dropping to the ground to perform a distraction display when disturbed, as well as displaying along a tree branch. In addition, distraction display tends to be most adaptive when animals nest solitarily, as solitary nesters lack the opportunity for mobbing a predator or otherwise performing communal defense, although some species have been observed to display in groups. Finally, distraction display tends to be adaptive when diurnal predation by visually-stimulated predators takes place (as these predators are most likely to notice the visual display).",

            "document": "Olive baboon . Females are sexually mature at seven to eight years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The beginning of a female's ovulation is a signal to the males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring have a better chance of surviving. These females also attract more males, and are more likely to cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship. Newborns have black natal coats and bright pink skin. Females are the primary caregivers of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant may be unable to stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. Its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. This difference lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practise co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as they are likely to be related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. Adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.",

The mute swan is less vocal than the noisy whooper and Bewick's swans; they do, however, make a variety of grunting, hoarse whistling, and snorting noises, especially in communicating with their cygnets, and usually hiss at competitors or intruders trying to enter their territory. The most familiar sound associated with mute swan is the vibrant throbbing of the wings in flight which is unique to the species, and can be heard from a range of , indicating its value as a contact sound between birds in flight. Cygnets are especially vocal, and communicate through a variety of whistling and chirping sounds when content, as well as a harsh squawking noise when distressed or lost. Mute swans can be very aggressive in defence of their nests and are highly protective of their mate and offspring. Most defensive attacks from a mute swan begin with a loud hiss and, if this is not sufficient to drive off the predator, are followed by a physical attack. Swans attack by smashing at their enemy with bony spurs in the wings, accompanied by biting with their large bill. The wings of the swan are very powerful, though not strong enough to break an adult man's leg, as said anecdotally. Large waterfowl, such as Canada geese, (more likely out of competition than in response to potential predation) may be aggressively driven off, and mute swans regularly attack people who enter their territory. The cob is responsible for defending the cygnets while on the water, and will sometimes attack small watercraft, such as canoes, that it feels are a threat to its young. The cob will additionally try and chase the predator out of his family territory, and will keep animals such as foxes and raptors at bay. In New York (outside its native range), the most common predators of cygnets are common snapping turtles. Healthy adults are rarely preyed upon, though canids such as coyotes, felids such as lynxes, and bears can pose a threat to infirm ones (healthy adults can usually swim away from danger unless defending nests) and there are a few cases of healthy adults falling prey to golden eagles. In England, there has been an increased rate of attacks on swans by out-of-control dogs, especially in parks where the birds are less territorial.

Multiple paternity in litters seems to be more common in Utah and Gunnison\u2019s prairie dogs. Mother prairie dogs do most of the care for the young. In addition to nursing the young, the mother also defends the nursery chamber and collects grass for the nest. Males play their part by defending the territories and maintaining the burrows. The young spend their first six weeks below the ground being nursed. They are then weaned and begin to surface from the burrow. By five months, they are fully grown. The subject of cooperative breeding in prairie dogs has been debated among biologists. Some argue prairie dogs will defend and feed young that are not theirs, and it seems young will sleep in a nursery chamber with other mothers; since most nursing occurs at night, this may be a case of communal nursing. In the case of the latter, others suggest communal nursing occurs only when mothers mistake another female's young for their own. Infanticide is known to occur in prairie dogs. Males which take over a family group will kill the offspring of the previous male. This causes the mother to go into estrus sooner. However, most infanticide is done by close relatives. Lactating females will kill the offspring of a related female both to decrease competition for the female\u2019s offspring and for increased foraging area due to a decrease in territorial defense by the victimized mother. Supporters of the theory that prairie dogs are communal breeders state that another reason for this type of infanticide is so that the female can get a possible helper.

Studies conducted by Repetti (1989) show that women respond to highly stressful workdays by providing more nurturing behaviors towards their children. In contrast, fathers who experienced stressful workdays were more likely to withdraw from their families or were more interpersonally conflictual that evening at home. Furthermore, physical contact between mothers and their offspring following a threatening event decreased HPA activity and sympathetic nervous system arousal.

            "document": "Predatory imminence continuum . Post-encounter defensive behaviours are avoidance behaviours performed when a predator is present and has been detected. When this stage of threat has been reached, behaviours are limited to species-specific defence reactions. These behaviours are commonly freezing, fleeing or threatening. The goal of a post-encounter defensive behaviour is to prevent the predatory imminence from further increasing. The dominant post-encounter defensive behaviour can depend on whether the predator has also detected the prey and how far away the two animals are from one another. Varying levels of predatory imminence, even in post-encounter situations, can affect the expressed defensive behaviour. If the prey has yet to be detected, the goal of the post-encounter behaviour will be to prevent the predator from detecting the prey. If both the predator and prey have detected each other, the goal will be to avoid making contact with the predator. Freezing behaviour in rats is an example of a post-encounter defensive behaviour which has been well studied. Freezing in rats is characterized by sudden, extended immobility, followed by a decreased heart rate and an increased respiration rate. This behaviour is often the dominant post-encounter defence behaviour in rats. In the laboratory setting, post-encounter defensive behaviours can be elicited by pairing a neutral stimulus, such as a light, with an aversive stimulus, such as a shock. The rat will engage in its post-encounter defensive behaviour when it becomes aware of the neutral stimulus, as the stimulus is acting as a predictor for the shock. Since the freezing behaviour is dominant in these situations, it can be assumed that it serves an adaptive function by preventing an additional increase in predatory imminence. Freezing is the dominant post-encounter behaviour because even when there are alternative defensive reactions available, freezing has been observed to be the rat's response the majority of the time. Even when a clear method of escape was made available, rats would freeze instead of fleeing. Freezing can prevent the perceived level of threat from increasing in several ways. If a rat becomes aware of a predator before the predator is aware of the prey, freezing can reduce the likelihood that the prey will be detected. As well, since many predators rely on motion to keep track of their prey, freezing may cause the predator to either lose site of their prey or shift their attention to a more active object.",

            "document": "Predatory imminence continuum . The development of the predatory imminence continuum began with the description of species-specific defence reactions. Species-specific defence reactions are innate responses demonstrated by an animal when they experience a threat. Since survival behaviours are so vital for an animal to acquire and demonstrate rapidly, it has been theorized that these defence reactions would not have time to be learned and therefore, must be innate. While these behaviours are species-specific, there are three general categories of defence reactions - fleeing, freezing, and threatening. Species-specific defence reactions are now recognized as being organized in a hierarchical system where different behaviours are exhibited, depending on the level of threat experienced. However, when this concept was first proposed, the dominant species-specific defence reaction in a certain context was thought to be controlled by operant conditioning. That is, if a species-specific defence reaction was unsuccessful in evading or controlling conflict, the hierarchical system would be rearranged because of the punishment, in the form of failure, experienced by an animal. It would then be unlikely for that species-specific defence reaction to be used in a similar situation again; instead, an alternative behaviour would be dominant. However, if the dominant behaviour was successful it would remain the recurring behaviour for that situation. After experimentation, this theory was met with much opposition, even by the person who proposed it. One point of opposition was found through the use of shock on rats and the species-specific defence reaction of freezing. This experiment found that while punishment did seem to affect freezing, it was not through response weakening but through the evoking of different levels of the behaviour. Other criticisms for this theory focused on the inability for species-specific defence reactions to effectively rearrange in this manner in natural situations. It has been argued that there would not be enough time for punishment, in the form of an animal being unsuccessful in its defence, to reorder the hierarchy of species-specific defence reactions. The rejection of the operant conditioning mechanism for the reorganization of species-specific defence reactions, led to the development of the predatory imminence continuum. The organization of defensive behaviours can be attributed to the level of threat an animal perceives itself to be in. This theory is one of adaptiveness, as the dominant defence reaction is the behaviour which is most effective in allowing the survival of the animal and the one which is most effective in preventing an increasing level of threat, also known as increasing imminence. The probability of being killed by a predator, known as predatory imminence, is what is responsible for the expressed defensive behaviour. The predatory imminence is dependent on many factors such as the distance from a predator, the potential for escape, and the likelihood of meeting a predator. Three general categories of defensive behaviours, based on increasing predatory imminence, have been identified. These are labelled as pre-encounter, post-encounter, and circa-strike defensive behaviours.",

Human and animal studies (reviewed in Taylor et al., 2000) suggest that oxytocin is the neuroendocrine mechanism underlying the female \"befriend\" stress response. Oxytocin administration to rats and prairie voles increased social contact and social grooming behaviors, reduced stress, and lowered aggression. In humans, oxytocin promotes mother-infant attachments, romantic pair bonds, and friendships. Social contact or support during stressful times leads to lowered sympathetic and neuroendocrine stress responses. Although social support downregulates these physiological stress responses in both men and women, women are more likely to seek social contact during stress. Furthermore, support from another female provides enhanced stress-reducing benefits to women. However, a review of female aggression noted that \"The fact that OT [oxytocin] enhances, rather than diminishes, attention to potential threat in the environment casts doubt on the popular \u2018tend-and-befriend\u2019 hypothesis which is based on the presumed anxiolytic effect of OT\".",

Stages of threat vary along a spectrum referred to as the \"predatory imminence continuum,\" spanning from low-risk (pre-encounter) to high-risk (interaction) threats. The main assumption of the predatory imminence continuum is that as threat levels increase, defensive response strategies change. During the pre-encounter period, an animal may engage in activities like exploration or foraging. But if the animal senses that a predator is nearby, the animal may begin to express species specific defense reactions such as freezing in an attempt to avoid detection by the predator. However, in situations where a threat is imminent, once the animal is detected by its predator, freezing may no longer be the optimal behaviour for survival. At this point, the animal enters the circa-strike phase, where its behaviour will transition from passive freezing to active flight, or even attack if escape is not possible.",

A high level of licking results in a long-term reduction in stress response as measured behaviorally and biochemically in elements of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Further, decreased DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene were found in offspring that experienced a high level of licking; the glucorticoid receptor plays a key role in regulating the HPA. The opposite is found in offspring that experienced low levels of licking, and when pups are switched, the epigenetic changes are reversed. This research provides evidence for an underlying epigenetic mechanism. Further support comes from experiments with the same setup, using drugs that can increase or decrease methylation. Finally, epigenetic variations in parental care can be passed down from one generation to the next, from mother to female offspring. Female offspring who received increased parental care (i.e., high licking) became mothers who engaged in high licking and offspring who received less licking became mothers who engaged in less licking.",

Emerging studies are showing an increasing link between oxytocin levels in humans and parent-child relationships. One idea is that increased oxytocin levels facilitates postnatal parental behaviour and the formation of an emotional bond between parent and infant, in mothers and fathers alike, by acting to reduce anxiety and ameliorate responses to external stresses. Parents who have a less anxious state of mind are able to increase their focus on infant care, improve mood, and facilitate the capacity to read non-verbal infant cues and stimulate the social learning and reward system in response to infant cues. Although there are strong animal models for the role of oxytocin in parental behaviour, one of the key questions in the development of a psychobiology of human care-giving and attachment is the degree to which the considerable variation in parenting can be accounted for through similar biological mechanisms such as the moderating role of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphisms and experimentally induced oxytocin levels. Van IJzendoorn and colleagues conducted several correlational studies documenting the role of OXTR in parenting, and carried out various randomized control trials showing that oxytocin enhances male and female sensitivity to child signals, in natural play settings as well as with a cry test, using behavioural assessments, EEG/ERP, and fMRI. A meta-analysis of experimental studies with intranasal oxytocin administration was conducted showing that feelings of trust are elevated and that the expected lowering of out-group trust was not confirmed.",

Mothers defend their offspring against predators as they mature by moving towards the threat and fanning their wings. Experiments show that without this protection their progeny have only a 3% survival rate in the wild. Further observation has shown that guarding eggs and protecting offspring after they hatch has a significant cost to the mother, reducing her future reproductive potential in terms of fecundity and clutch number. Evolutionary theory predicts that parental investment should change depending on the reproductive value of offspring and future reproductive potential of parents. Douglas Tallamy found that maternal defensive behaviour in this species is consistent with the theory, since mothers became more aggressive in their clutch defense as they got older (less future reproduction at risk) and as the nymphs in each clutch matured (greater investment lost/higher survival potential as they get bigger). Because of heavy predation, this investment is necessary. However, females can reduce costs to themselves by laying in the egg masses of conspecifics (\"i.e.\" other mothers) who will then take care of their offspring for them (similar behaviour occurs in other species; see brood parasite). This exploitation of other females is common; eggs are laid in neighbouring egg masses whenever there is opportunity to do so. Egg dumpers were observed to have higher mortality rates per egg, but were at an advantage because they were more fecund (could lay more eggs) and were at lower risk of predation.",

In the hippocampus of adult male rats, prenatal stress has shown to decrease the rate of proliferation and cell death in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Prenatal stressed animals have prolonged corticosterone response. Removing the adrenal glands of the mother eliminates the effect of the pup's corticosterone response. Supplementing the adrenalectamized mother with corticosterone, rescued the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis response to maternal stress for prenatally stressed offspring. Prenatal stress caused high glucocorticoids, which in turn affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis negative feedback. A study by Garc\u00eda-C\u00e1ceres et al. showed that prenatal stress decreases cell turnover and proliferation in the hypothalamus of adult rats, which reduces structural plasticity and reduces the response to stress in adulthood. This study also showed that when prenatally stressed rats were stressed in adulthood the females showed an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone suggesting it to be an up-regulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. Males showed no elevation of corticosterone levels. Increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone with no effect of adult stress and a decrease in the corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA in the hypothalamus showed a down-regulation. The author concludes that this makes prenatally stressed females less reactive to later life stressors than males.",

While working at McGill University in Montr\u00e9al in 2004, they discovered that the type and amount of nurturing a mother rat provides in the early weeks of the rat's infancy determines how that rat responds to stress later in life. This stress sensitivity was linked to a down-regulation in the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in the brain. In turn, this down-regulation was found to be a consequence of the extent of methylation in the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene. Immediately after birth, Meaney and Szyf found that methyl groups repress the glucocorticoid receptor gene in all rat pups, making the gene unable to unwind from the histone in order to be transcribed, causing a decreased stress response. Nurturing behaviours from the mother rat were found to stimulate activation of stress signalling pathways that remove methyl groups from DNA. This releases the tightly wound gene, exposing it for transcription. The glucocorticoid gene is activated, resulting in lowered stress response. Rat pups that receive a less nurturing upbringing are more sensitive to stress throughout their life-span.",

He hypothesized that [[glucocorticoid receptor]] (GR) density was involved in the HPA feedback loop. Meaney and colleagues later went on to confirm this feedback loop in research examining the effect of maternal care on GR expression. In this research, Meaney and colleagues separated mother rats into two groups: high licking and grooming (HLG) mothers and low licking and grooming (LLG) mothers. Pups of HLG mothers had a significantly greater density of GRs in their hippocampus than pups of LLG mothers. Further, this research\u2014unlike previous research\u2014established a causational relationship between maternal care and behaviroal epigenetic programing with cross fostering of pups by various mothers of differing maternal behaviors. The causal relationship between maternal care and epigenetic programing was further solidified by studying estrogen receptor expression in the medial pre-optic area of the brain. This research found that HLG mothers create pups that are also HLG mothers even with cross fostering. His early epigenetic research was instrumental in understanding the potential epigenetic research has for behavior in both animals and humans.

Aside from nursing the young, the mother carries her pup out of camp each night in search of food. While flying, the pup holds onto the nipple with its adapted, curved teeth and grabs onto the mother's waist with their feet. This persists for up to five weeks, or whenever the offspring becomes too heavy for their mother to support. For the next three to five weeks, the pup is left in a tree either in or just outside of their camp while the mother forages until dawn. This stage in a pup's life ends when the pup learns how to fly and can search for their own food, which generally occurs eight to ten weeks after birth. While their diets consist mainly of fruit, these bats' favorite food is the pollen and nectar of eucalyptus blossoms; however, due to a shortage of these and other preferred blossoms, flying fruit foxes are forced to feed on the less favorable exotic and cultivated fruit in Sulawesi. They also serve a major role in pollination and seed dispersal in the forest. By congregating in large numbers following the blooming of various plants and thanks to their large size, they are able to spread seeds (either through digestion or from pollen stuck to their fur) in greater quantities at greater distances than birds and insects. These bats live in colonies, also called camps. Some camps are permanent while others are only temporary; many times, camps will only be inhabited during a certain time of the year for roosting. The camps are formed in a protected area consisting of dense, tall trees and are usually close to a water source. The population size of camps is directly proportional to the surrounding availability of food. Camps are essential for the survival of flying foxes as this is where they form relationships and learn how to survive. \u00a0Flying fruit foxes are nocturnal, feeding during the night. At dawn, the bats either return to their permanent camp of they find another camp to rest and socialize with other bats for a day.
