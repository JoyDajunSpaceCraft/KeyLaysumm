These structures are made of interlocking calcium carbonate plates, which can either fit tightly together, as in the case of sea urchins, or can be loosely bound, such as in the case of starfish. The epidermis or skin covering the calcium carbonate plates are able to uptake and secrete nutrients in order to support and maintain the skeleton. The epidermis usually also contains pigment cells to give the organism color, can detect motion of small creatures on the animal\u2019s surface, and also generally contain gland cells to secrete fluids or toxins. These calcium carbonate plates and skeletons provide the organism structure, support, and protection.  As anyone who has eaten a crab or lobster knows, crustaceans have a hard outer shell. The crustacean will form a network of chitin-protein fibers and then will precipitate calcium carbonate within this matrix of fibers. These chitin-protein fibers are first hardened by sclerotization, or crosslinking of protein and polysaccharides and of proteins with other proteins before the calcification process begins. The calcium carbonate component makes up between 20 and 50% of the shell. The presence of a hard, calcified exoskeleton means that the crustacean has to molt and shed the exoskeleton as its body size increases. This links the calcification process to the molting cycles, making a regular source of calcium and carbonate ions crucial. The crustacean is the only phylum of animals that can resorb calcified structures, and will reabsorb minerals from the old shell and incorporate them into the new shell. Various body parts of the crustacean will have a different mineral content, varying the hardness at these locations with the harder areas being generally stronger. This calcite shell provides protection for the crustaceans, and between the molting cycles the crustacean must avoid predators while it waits for the calcite shell to form and harden.  Foraminifera, or forams, are single-celled protists with shells, or tests made of calcium carbonate shells to protect themselves. These organisms are one of the most abundant groups of shelled organisms, but are very small, usually between 0.05 and 0.5mm in diameter. However their shells are divided into chambers that accumulate during growth, in some cases allowing these single-celled organisms to become almost 20 centimeters in length. Foraminiferal classification is dependent on the characteristics of the shell, such as chamber shape and arrangement, surface ornamentation, wall composition, and other features. Phytoplankton, such as coccolithophores, are also well known for their calcium carbonate production. It is estimated that these phytoplankton may contribute up to 70% to the global calcium carbonate precipitation, and coccolithophores are the largest phytoplankton contributors. Contributing between 1 and 10% of total primary productivity, 200 species of coccolithophores live in the ocean, and under the right conditions they can form large blooms in subpolar regions. These large bloom formations are a driving force for the export of calcium carbonate from the surface to the deep ocean in what is sometimes called \u201cCoccolith rain\u201d. As the coccolithophores sink to the seafloor they contribute to the vertical carbon dioxide gradient in the water column.",

One area of research that shows promise is the study of the role of calcium ion influx into the damaged neuron as a cause of cell death and general brain tissue swelling. Calcium enters nerve cells through damaged channels in the axon's membrane. The excess calcium inside the cell causes the axon to swell and also activates chemicals, called proteases, that break down proteins. One family of proteases, the calpains, are especially damaging to nerve cells because they break down proteins that maintain the structure of the axon. Excess calcium within the cell is also destructive to the cell's mitochondria, structures that produce the cell's energy. Mitochondria soak up excess calcium until they swell and stop functioning. If enough mitochondria are damaged, the nerve cell degenerates. Calcium influx has other damaging effects: it activates destructive enzymes, such as caspases that damage the DNA in the cell and trigger programmed cell death, and it damages sodium channels in the cell membrane, allowing sodium ions to flood the cell as well. Sodium influx exacerbates swelling of the cell body and axon.",

Levels of intracellular calcium are regulated by transport proteins that remove it from the cell. For example, the sodium-calcium exchanger uses energy from the electrochemical gradient of sodium by coupling the influx of sodium into cell (and down its concentration gradient) with the transport of calcium out of the cell. In addition, the plasma membrane Ca ATPase (PMCA) obtains energy to pump calcium out of the cell by hydrolysing adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

This ion pump helps to reset the movement of ions during an action potential by sending K into the cell and sending Na out of the cell. Since it opposes the normal flow of ions during an action potential, energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is used. Calcium is also regulated using this Na-K-ATPase due to the enzyme's interactions with protein and non-protein molecules. The main interaction that keeps calcium regulated is the binding of Na-K-ATPase to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).

This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes (the calcium is said to be a second messenger; see calcium in biology for more details). Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate (found in chalk) and calcium phosphate, two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones.

VGCCs have been immunolocalized in the zona glomerulosa of normal and hyperplastic human adrenal, as well as in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA), and in the latter T-type VGCCs correlated with plasma aldosterone levels of patients.

This is achieved by both the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland, and the parathyroid glands constantly sensing (i.e. measuring) the concentration of calcium ions in the blood flowing through them. When the concentration rises the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland increase their secretion of calcitonin (a proteinaceous hormone) into the blood. At the same time the parathyroid glands reduce their rate of parathyroid hormone (or PTH, also a proteinaceous hormone) secretion into the blood. The resulting high levels of calcitonin in the blood stimulate the skeleton to remove calcium from the blood plasma, and deposit it as bone. The reduced levels of PTH inhibit removal of calcium from the skeleton. The low levels of PTH have several other effects: they increase the loss of calcium in the urine, but more importantly inhibit the loss of phosphate ions via that route. Phosphate ions will therefore be retained in the plasma where they form insoluble salts with calcium ions, thereby removing them from the ionized calcium pool in the blood. The low levels of PTH also inhibit the formation of calcitriol (1,25\u00a0dihydroxyvitamin D) from cholecalciferol (vitamin D) by the kidneys. The reduction in the blood calcitriol concentration acts (comparatively slowly) on the epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the duodenum inhibiting their ability to absorb calcium from the intestinal contents.

Mast cells are leukocytes (white blood cells) rich in histamine which are able to respond to a variety of stimuli, often initiating inflammatory and/or allergic responses. The responses generated by mast cells rely on the calcium influx in the plasma membrane with the help of channels. Surface localization of the TRPV2 protein along with coupling of the protein to calcium and proinflammatory degranulation have been found in mast cells. The activation of TRPV2 in high temperatures permits calcium ion influx, inducing the release of proinflammatory factors. Therefore, TRPV2 is essential in mast cell degranulation as a result of its response to heat.  Immune cells are also able to kill pathogens by binding to them and engulfing them in a process known as phagocytosis. In macrophages TRPV2 recruitment toward the phagosome is regulated by PI3k signaling, protein kinase C, akt kinase, and Src kinases. They are able to locate these microbes through chemotaxis which is TRPV2 mediated. When the pathogen is endocytosed it is degraded then presented on the membrane of antigen presenting cells (i.e macrophages). Macrophages present these antigens to T cells via a major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The region between the MHC-peptide and the T cell receptor is known as the immunosynapse. TRPV2 channels are highly concentrated in this region. When these two cells interact, it allows calcium to diffuse through the TRPV2 channel.

If the TRPV2 channel were absent or not functioning properly in T cells, T cell receptor signaling would not be optimal. TRPV2 also acts as a transmembrane protein on the surface of B cells, negatively controlling B cell activation.

The bicarbonate buffer system regulates the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonate to be equal to 1:20, at which ratio the blood pH is 7.4 (as explained in the Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation). A change in the plasma pH gives an acid\u2013base imbalance. In acid\u2013base homeostasis there are two mechanisms that can help regulate the pH. Respiratory compensation a mechanism of the respiratory center, adjusts the partial pressure of carbon dioxide by changing the rate and depth of breathing, to bring the pH back to normal. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide also determines the concentration of carbonic acid, and the bicarbonate buffer system can also come into play. Renal compensation can help the bicarbonate buffer system. The sensor for the plasma bicarbonate concentration is not known for certain. It is very probable that the renal tubular cells of the distal convoluted tubules are themselves sensitive to the pH of the plasma. The metabolism of these cells produces carbon dioxide, which is rapidly converted to hydrogen and bicarbonate through the action of carbonic anhydrase. When the ECF pH falls (becoming more acidic) the renal tubular cells excrete hydrogen ions into the tubular fluid to leave the body via urine. Bicarbonate ions are simultaneously secreted into the blood that decreases the carbonic acid, and consequently raises the plasma pH.

Increasing temperature, intense evaporation, and mixing water that is high in CO\u2083 and low in calcium cations with seawater are some examples of processes that change bicarbonate ions to carbonate ions. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by being dissolved in water and is turned into carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then weathers rocks, creating bicarbonate and other ions. Then the calcium carbonate is a precipitate from calcium and the bicarbonate ions that formed through organisms like coral, and then the carbon is stored in layers of limestone on the seafloor. In terms of geologic time, the composition of limestone has changed from calcite rich limestone to aragonite rich limestone. The presence of magnesium ions at certain concentrations inhibits the ability to precipitate calcite. Aragonite, however, has the same chemical formula as calcite but it is in a different crystal system that is much less prone to the magnesium preventing the precipitation of this mineral, which would prevent it from forming carbonate rocks. At times in geologic history where the Mg and Ca ratio were different, and the seas were more abundant in calcite and this was as a result of the high rates of seafloor spreading because of tectonic plate movement and action.

Echinoderms, of the phylum Echinodermata, include sea creatures such as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, crinoids, sea cucumbers and brittle stars. This group of organisms is known for their radial symmetry and they mostly use the intracellular calcifying strategy, keeping their calcified structures inside their bodies.

These structures are made of interlocking calcium carbonate plates, which can either fit tightly together, as in the case of sea urchins, or can be loosely bound, such as in the case of starfish. The epidermis or skin covering the calcium carbonate plates are able to uptake and secrete nutrients in order to support and maintain the skeleton. The epidermis usually also contains pigment cells to give the organism color, can detect motion of small creatures on the animal\u2019s surface, and also generally contain gland cells to secrete fluids or toxins. These calcium carbonate plates and skeletons provide the organism structure, support, and protection.  As anyone who has eaten a crab or lobster knows, crustaceans have a hard outer shell. The crustacean will form a network of chitin-protein fibers and then will precipitate calcium carbonate within this matrix of fibers. These chitin-protein fibers are first hardened by sclerotization, or crosslinking of protein and polysaccharides and of proteins with other proteins before the calcification process begins. The calcium carbonate component makes up between 20 and 50% of the shell. The presence of a hard, calcified exoskeleton means that the crustacean has to molt and shed the exoskeleton as its body size increases. This links the calcification process to the molting cycles, making a regular source of calcium and carbonate ions crucial. The crustacean is the only phylum of animals that can resorb calcified structures, and will reabsorb minerals from the old shell and incorporate them into the new shell. Various body parts of the crustacean will have a different mineral content, varying the hardness at these locations with the harder areas being generally stronger. This calcite shell provides protection for the crustaceans, and between the molting cycles the crustacean must avoid predators while it waits for the calcite shell to form and harden.  Foraminifera, or forams, are single-celled protists with shells, or tests made of calcium carbonate shells to protect themselves. These organisms are one of the most abundant groups of shelled organisms, but are very small, usually between 0.05 and 0.5mm in diameter. However their shells are divided into chambers that accumulate during growth, in some cases allowing these single-celled organisms to become almost 20 centimeters in length. Foraminiferal classification is dependent on the characteristics of the shell, such as chamber shape and arrangement, surface ornamentation, wall composition, and other features. Phytoplankton, such as coccolithophores, are also well known for their calcium carbonate production. It is estimated that these phytoplankton may contribute up to 70% to the global calcium carbonate precipitation, and coccolithophores are the largest phytoplankton contributors. Contributing between 1 and 10% of total primary productivity, 200 species of coccolithophores live in the ocean, and under the right conditions they can form large blooms in subpolar regions. These large bloom formations are a driving force for the export of calcium carbonate from the surface to the deep ocean in what is sometimes called \u201cCoccolith rain\u201d. As the coccolithophores sink to the seafloor they contribute to the vertical carbon dioxide gradient in the water column.",

It is very probable that the renal tubular cells of the distal convoluted tubules are themselves sensitive to the pH of the plasma. The metabolism of these cells produces CO, which is rapidly converted to H and HCO through the action of carbonic anhydrase. When the extracellular fluids tend towards acidity, the renal tubular cells secrete the H ions into the tubular fluid from where they exit the body via the urine. The HCO ions are simultaneously secreted into the blood plasma, thus raising the bicarbonate ion concentration in the plasma, lowering the carbonic acid/bicarbonate ion ratio, and consequently raising the pH of the plasma. The converse happens when the plasma pH rises above normal: bicarbonate ions are excreted into the urine, and hydrogen ions into the plasma. These combine with the bicarbonate ions in the plasma to form carbonic acid (H + HCO = HCO), thus raising the carbonic acid:bicarbonate ratio in the extracellular fluids, and returning its pH to normal.",

Since alkalinity, or acid-buffering capacity, of the water is regulated by the number of hydrogen ions that a cation can accept, carbonate (can accept 2 H) and bicarbonate (can accept 1 H) are the principal components of alkalinity in estuarine and marine systems. Since acidic conditions promote shell dissolution, the alkalinity of the water is positively correlated with shell deposition, especially in estuarine regions that experience broad swings in pH. Based on the carbonate equilibrium equations, an increase in K leads to higher levels of available carbonate and a potential increase in calcification rates as a result. The values for K and K can be influenced by several different physical factors, including temperature, salinity and pressure, so organisms in different habitats can encounter different equilibrium conditions. Many of these same factors influence solubility of calcium carbonate, with the solubility product constant Ksp expressed as the concentration of dissolved calcium and carbonate ions at equilibrium: K = [Ca][CO]. Therefore, increases in K based on differences in temperature or pressure or increases in the apparent solubility constant K\u2019 as a result of salinity or pH changes means that calcium carbonate is more soluble. Increased solubility of CaCO makes shell deposition more difficult, and so this has a negative impact on the calcification process.",

This decreased health of coral reefs, particularly the Great Barrier Reef, can result in reduced biodiversity. Organisms can become stressed due to ocean acidification and the disappearance of healthy coral reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef, is a loss of habitat for several taxa.  Atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen from 280 to 380 ppm since the industrial revolution. This increase in carbon dioxide has led to a 0.1 decrease in pH, and it could decrease by 0.5 by 2100. When carbon dioxide meets seawater it forms carbonic acid, which then dissociates into hydrogen, bicarbonate, and carbonate and lowers the pH of the ocean. Sea surface temperature, ocean acidity, and dissolved inorganic carbon are also positively correlated with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Ocean acidification can cause hypercapnia and increase stress in marine organisms, thereby leading to decreasing biodiversity. Coral reefs themselves can also be negatively affected by ocean acidification, as calcification rates decrease as acidity increases.",

Alkalinity can be measured by titrating a sample with a strong acid until all the buffering capacity of the aforementioned ions above the pH of bicarbonate or carbonate is consumed. This point is functionally set to pH 4.5. At this point, all the bases of interest have been protonated to the zero level species, hence they no longer cause alkalinity. In the carbonate system the bicarbonate ions [HCO] and the carbonate ions [CO] have become converted to carbonic acid [HCO] at this pH. This pH is also called the CO equivalence point where the major component in water is dissolved CO which is converted to HCO in an aqueous solution. There are no strong acids or bases at this point. Therefore, the alkalinity is modeled and quantified with respect to the CO equivalence point. Because the alkalinity is measured with respect to the CO equivalence point, the dissolution of CO, although it adds acid and dissolved inorganic carbon, does not change the alkalinity. In natural conditions, the dissolution of basic rocks and addition of ammonia [NH] or organic amines leads to the addition of base to natural waters at the CO equivalence point. The dissolved base in water increases the pH and titrates an equivalent amount of CO to bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion. At equilibrium, the water contains a certain amount of alkalinity contributed by the concentration of weak acid anions. Conversely, the addition of acid converts weak acid anions to CO and continuous addition of strong acids can cause the alkalinity to become less than zero. For example, the following reactions take place during the addition of acid to a typical seawater solution:",

A bicarbonate indicator (hydrogencarbonate indicator) is a type of pH indicator that is sensitive enough to show a color change as the concentration of carbon dioxide gas in an aqueous solution increases. The indicator is used in photosynthesis and respiration experiments to find out whether carbon dioxide is being liberated. It is also used to test the carbon dioxide content during gaseous exchange of organisms. When the carbon dioxide content is higher than 0.04%, the initial red color changes to yellow as the pH becomes more acidic. If the carbon dioxide content is lower than 0.04%, it changes from red to magenta and, in relatively very low carbon dioxide concentrations, to purple. Carbon dioxide, even in the concentrations found in exhaled air, will dissolve in the indicator to form carbonic acid, a weak acid, which will lower the pH and give the characteristic colour change. A colour change to purple during photosynthesis shows a reduction in the percentage of carbon dioxide and is sometimes inferred as production of oxygen, but there is not actually any direct evidence for it.",

In the ocean, wave and wind movement allows carbon dioxide (CO) to mixes with water (HO) forming carbonic acid (HCO). Through wave motion this chemical bond is mixed up, allowing for the further break of the bond, eventually becoming carbonate (CO) which is basic and helps form shells for ocean creatures, and two hydron molecules. This creates the potential for acidic threat since hydron ions readily bond with any Lewis Structure to form an acidic bond. This is referred to as an oxidation-reduction reaction.",
