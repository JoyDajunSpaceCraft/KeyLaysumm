Bipedal movement also re-evolved in a number of other dinosaur lineages such as the iguanodons. Some extinct members of the crocodilian line, a sister group to the dinosaurs and birds, also evolved bipedal forms - a crocodile relative from the triassic, \"Effigia okeeffeae\", is thought to be bipedal. Pterosaurs were previously thought to have been bipedal, but recent trackways have all shown quadrupedal locomotion. Bipedalism also evolved independently among the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of fossils from the early dinosaur genus \"Eoraptor\" establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists suspect \"Eoraptor\" resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as \"Marasuchus\" and \"Lagerpeton\" in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.",

Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in \"Herrerasaurus\"); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in \"Saturnalia\", for example).

Carolini discovered the tibia of a theropod dinosaur while driving a dune buggy in the badlands near Villa El Choc\u00f3n, in the Neuqu\u00e9n province of Patagonia, Argentina. Specialists from the National University of Comahue were sent to excavate the specimen after being notified of the find. The discovery was announced by the Argentinean palaeontologists Rodolfo Coria and Leonardo Salgado at a Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in 1994, where American science writer Don Lessem offered to fund the excavation, after having been impressed by a photo of the leg-bone. The partial skull was scattered over an area of about 10 square metres (110 sq ft), and the postcranial skeleton was disarticulated. The specimen preserved almost 70% of the skeleton, and included most of the vertebral column, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, the femora, and the left tibia and fibula. In 1995, this specimen (MUCPv-Ch1) was preliminarily described in \"Nature\" by Coria and Salgado, who made it the holotype of the new genus and species \"Giganotosaurus carolinii\" (parts of the skeleton were still encased in plaster at this time). The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words \"gigas/\u03b3\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2\" (meaning \"giant\"), \"notos/\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\" (meaning \"austral/southern\", in reference to its provenance) and \"-sauros/-\u03c3\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" (meaning \"lizard\"). The specific name honours Carolini, the discoverer. The holotype skeleton is now housed in the Ernesto Bachmann Palaeontological Museum in Villa El Choc\u00f3n, which was inaugurated in 1995 at the request of Carolini. The specimen is the main exhibition at the museum, and is placed on the sandy floor of a room devoted to the animal, along with tools used by palaeontologists during the excavation. A mounted reconstruction of the skeleton is exhibited in an adjacent room. One of the features of theropod dinosaurs that has attracted most scientific interest is the fact that the group includes the largest terrestrial predators of the Mesozoic Era. This interest began with the discovery of one of the first known dinosaurs, \"Megalosaurus\", named in 1824 for its large size. More than half a century later in 1905, \"Tyrannosaurus\" was named, and it remained the largest known theropod dinosaur for 90 years, though other large theropods were also known. The discussion of which theropod was the largest was revived in the 1990s by new discoveries in Africa and South America. In their original description, Coria and Salgado considered \"Giganotosaurus\" at least the largest theropod dinosaur from the southern hemisphere, and perhaps the largest in the world. They conceded that comparison with \"Tyrannosaurus\" was difficult due to the disarticulated state of the cranial bones of \"Giganotosaurus\", but noted that at , the femur of \"Giganotosaurus\" was 5\u00a0cm (2\u00a0in) longer than that of \"Sue\", the largest known \"Tyrannosaurus\" specimen, and that the bones of \"Giganotosaurus\" appeared to be more robust, indicating a heavier animal. They estimated the skull to have been about 1.53\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) long, and the whole animal to have been 12.5\u00a0m (41\u00a0ft) long, with a weight of about .",

The first birds inherited teeth and long, bony tails from their dinosaur ancestors, but some had developed horny, toothless beaks by the very Late Jurassic and short pygostyle tails by the Early Cretaceous. While the archosaurs and dinosaurs were becoming more dominant in the Triassic, the mammaliaform successors of the therapsids evolved into small, mainly nocturnal insectivores. This ecological role may have promoted the evolution of mammals, for example nocturnal life may have accelerated the development of endothermy (\"warm-bloodedness\") and hair or fur. By in the Early Jurassic there were animals that were very like today's mammals in a number of respects. Unfortunately, there is a gap in the fossil record throughout the Middle Jurassic. However, fossil teeth discovered in Madagascar indicate that the split between the lineage leading to monotremes and the one leading to other living mammals had occurred by . After dominating land vertebrate niches for about 150 Ma, the non-avian dinosaurs perished in the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event () along with many other groups of organisms. Mammals throughout the time of the dinosaurs had been restricted to a narrow range of taxa, sizes and shapes, but increased rapidly in size and diversity after the extinction, with bats taking to the air within 13\u00a0million years, and cetaceans to the sea within 15\u00a0million years. The first flowering plants appeared around 130 Ma. The 250,000 to 400,000 species of flowering plants outnumber all other ground plants combined, and are the dominant vegetation in most terrestrial ecosystems. There is fossil evidence that flowering plants diversified rapidly in the Early Cretaceous, from , and that their rise was associated with that of pollinating insects. Among modern flowering plants \"Magnolia\" are thought to be close to the common ancestor of the group. However, paleontologists have not succeeded in identifying the earliest stages in the evolution of flowering plants. The social insects are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile. This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as natural selection and the selfish gene. In fact, there are very few eusocial insect species: only 15 out of approximately 2,600 living families of insects contain eusocial species, and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among arthropods, although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families. Nevertheless, social insects have been spectacularly successful; for example although ants and termites account for only about 2% of known insect species, they form over 50% of the total mass of insects. Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success.",

Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as \"Archaeopteryx\". Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for \"Scelidosaurus\" that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling. Owen had not indicated a holotype. In 1888, Richard Lydekker while cataloguing the BMNH fossils, designated some of the hindlimb fragments described in 1861, specimen BMNH 39496 consisting of a lower part of a femur and an upper part of the tibia and fibula, together forming a knee joint, as the type specimen, hereby implicitly choosing them as the lectotype of \"Scelidosaurus\". Lydekker gave no reason for this choice; perhaps he was motivated by their larger size. Unfortunately, mixed in with the \"Scelidosaurus\" fossils had been the partial remains of a theropod dinosaur and the femur and tibia thus belonged to such a carnivore; this was not discovered until 1968 by Bernard Newman. The same year, B. H. Newman suggested to have Lydekker's selection of the knee joint as the lectotype officially rescinded by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, as the joint was in his opinion from a species related to \"Megalosaurus\". Eventually, after Newman had already died, Alan Jack Charig actually filed a request in 1992. In 1994 the ICZN reacted positively, in Opinion 1788 deciding that the skull and skeleton, specimen BMNH R.1111, would be the neotype of \"Scelidosaurus\". The knee joint was in 1995 by Samuel Welles \"et al.\" informally assigned to a \"Merosaurus\", which name has not yet been validly published. It more likely belongs to some member of the Coelophysoidea or Neoceratosauria. It has also been established by Newman and confirmed by Roger Benson that the original left thigbone, GSM 109560, belonged to a theropod. The neotype skeleton had been uncovered in the Black Ven Marl or Woodstone Nodule Bed, marine deposits of the Charmouth Mudstone Formation, dating from the late Sinemurian stage, about 191 million years ago. It consists of a rather complete skeleton with skull and lower jaws. Only the snout tip, the neck base, the forelimbs and the tail end are missing. Hundreds of osteoderms were found in connection with the skeleton, many more or less in their original position. From the 1960s onward, this fossil was further prepared by Ronald Croucher using acid baths to free the bones from the surrounding matrix, a method perfected for the Charmouth fossils. In 1992, Charig reported that only a single block had yet to be treated, but he died before the results could be published. Norman, who intends to complete this task, has revealed some new anatomical details in 2004. Apart from these, a modern description is largely lacking. Apart from the neotype, other fossils are known of \"Scelidosaurus\". In 1888 Lydekker catalogued a large number of single bones, largely limb elements, and osteoderms, that had been acquired by the BMNH from the Norris collection. Owen in 1861 described a second, partial, skeleton of a juvenile animal, that later was added to the collection of Elizabeth Philpot and today is registered in the Lyme Regis Museum as specimen LYMPH 1997.37.4-10. As it was relatively large, Owen speculated, in the context of its presumed marine lifestyle, that \"Scelidosaurus\" might have been ovoviviparous. The short prepubis in this specimen convinced scientists that this process did not represent the main pubic body as some had thought, who had been unable to believe that the thin, backward-pointing, pubis with the Ornithischia was homologous to the forward-pointing much larger pubic bone in most reptilian groups. In more recent times, new discoveries have been made at Charmouth, not through commercial quarrying but by the efforts of amateur palaeontologists. In 1968 a second partial juvenile skeleton was described, specimen BMNH R6704, that had already been reported in 1959. Found by geologist James Frederick Jackson (1894-1966) of Charmouth, it is from a slightly younger layer, the Stonebarrow Marl Member dating to the early Pliensbachian, about 190 million years old. In 1985 Simon Barnsley, David Costain and Peter Langham excavated a partial skeleton including a very complete skull and skin impressions, which was sold to the Bristol Museum where it is registered as specimen BRSMG CE12785. Specimen CAMSMX.39256 is part of the collection of the Sedgwick Museum at Cambridge. Several specimens remain undescribed because they are in private collections. These include a two metres (7\u00a0ft) long skeleton found by David Sole in 2000, perhaps the most complete non-avian dinosaur exemplar ever discovered in the British Isles. All elements of the skeleton are now known. The finds by Sole differ from the neotype in details of the armour and might represent a separate taxon or reflect sexual dimorphism.",

Heterodontosauridae was defined as a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of \"Heterodontosaurus\" and the early theropod \"Eoraptor\" were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida.

During the summer of 1990, a group of workers from the Black Hills Institute, located in Hill City, searched for fossils at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in western South Dakota near the city of Faith. By the end of the summer, the group had discovered \"Edmontosaurus\" bones and was ready to leave. However, a flat tire was discovered on their truck before the group could depart on August 12. While the rest of the group went into town to repair the truck, Sue Hendrickson decided to explore the nearby cliffs that the group had not checked. As she was walking along the base of a cliff, she discovered some small pieces of bone. She looked above her to see where the bones had originated, and observed larger bones protruding from the wall of the cliff. She returned to camp with two small pieces of the bones and reported the discovery to the president of the Black Hills Institute, Peter Larson. He determined that the bones were from a \"T. rex\" by their distinctive contour and texture. Later, closer examination of the site showed many visible bones above the ground and some articulated vertebrae. The crew ordered extra plaster and, although some of the crew had to depart, Hendrickson and a few other workers began to uncover the bones. The group was excited, as it was evident that much of the dinosaur had been preserved. Previously discovered \"T. rex\" skeletons were usually missing over half of their bones. It was later determined that Sue was a record 90 percent complete by bulk. Scientists believe that this specimen was covered by water and mud soon after its death which prevented other animals from carrying away the bones. Additionally, the rushing water mixed the skeleton together. When the fossil was found the hip bones were above the skull and the leg bones were intertwined with the ribs. The large size and the excellent condition of the bones were also surprising. The skull was long, and most of the teeth were still intact. After the group completed excavating the bones, each vertebra was covered in burlap and coated in plaster, followed by a transfer to the offices of The Black Hills Institute where they began to clean the bones.",

In order for birds to balance these forces, certain physical characteristics are required. Asymmetrical wings, found on all flying birds with the exception of hummingbirds, help in the production of thrust and lift. Anything that moves through the air produces drag due to friction. The aerodynamic body of a bird can reduce drag, but when stopping or slowing down a bird will use its tail and feet to increase drag. Weight is the largest obstacle birds must overcome in order to fly. An animal can more easily attain flight by reducing its absolute weight. Birds evolved from other theropod dinosaurs that had already gone through a phase of size reduction during the Middle Jurassic, combined with rapid evolutionary changes. Flying birds during their evolution further reduced relative weight through several characteristics such as the loss of teeth, gonadal hypertrophy, and fusion of bones. Teeth were replaced by a lightweight bill made of keratin, and chewing moved to the bird's gizzard. Other advanced physical characteristics evolved for flight are a keel for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged cerebellum for fine motor coordination. These were gradual changes, though, and not strict conditions for flight: the first birds had teeth, at best a small keel and relatively unfused bones. Pneumatic bone, that is hollow or filled with air sacs, has often been seen as an adaptation reducing weight, but it was already present in non-flying dinosaurs, and birds on average do not have a lighter skeleton than mammals of the same size. The same is true for the furcula, a bone which enhances skeletal bracing for the stresses of flight.",

It was originally thought that \"Microraptor\" was a glider, and probably lived mainly in trees, because the hindwings anchored to the feet of \"Microraptor\" would have hindered their ability to run on the ground. Some paleontologists have suggested that feathered dinosaurs used their wings to parachute from trees, possibly to attack or ambush prey on the ground, as a precursor to gliding or true flight. In their 2007 study, Chatterjee and Templin tested this hypothesis as well, and found that the combined wing surface of \"Microraptor\" was too narrow to successfully parachute to the ground without injury from any significant height. However, the authors did leave open the possibility that \"Microraptor\" could have parachuted short distances, as between closely spaced tree branches. Wind tunnel experiments have demonstrated that sustaining a high-lift coefficient at the expense of high drag was likely the most efficient strategy for \"Microraptor\" when gliding between low elevations. \"Microraptor\" did not require a sophisticated, \u2018modern\u2019 wing morphology to be an effective glider. However, the idea that \"Microraptor\" was an arboreal glider relies on it to have regularly climbed or even lived in trees, when study of its anatomy have shown that its limb proportions fall in line with modern ground birds rather than climbers, and its skeleton shows none of the expected adaptations in animals specialized for climbing trees. Describing specimens originally referenced as a distinctive species (\"Cryptovolans pauli\"), paleontologist Stephen Czerkas argued \"Microraptor\" may have been a powered flier, and indeed possibly a better flyer than \"Archaeopteryx\". He noted that the \"Microraptor's\" fused sternum, asymmetrical feathers, and features of the shoulder girdle indicated an that it could fly under its own power, rather than merely gliding. Today, most scientists agree that \"Microraptor\" had the anatomical features expected of a flying animal, though it would have been a less advanced form of flight compared to birds. For example, some studies suggest the shoulder joint was too primitive to allow a full flapping flight stroke. In the ancestral anatomy of theropod dinosaurs, the shoulder socket faced downward and slightly backward, making it impossible for the animals to raise their arms vertically, a prerequisite for the flapping flight stroke in birds. Studies of maniraptoran anatomy have suggested that the shoulder socket did not shift into the bird-like position of a high, upward orientation close to the vertebral column until relatively advanced avialans like the enantiornithes appeared. However, other scientists have argued that the shoulder girdle in some paravian theropods, including \"Microraptor\", is curved in such a way that the shoulder joint could only have been positioned high on the back, allowing for a nearly vertical upstroke of the wing. This possibly advanced shoulder anatomy, combined with the presence of a propatagium linking the wrist to the shoulder (which fills the space in front of the flexed wing and may support the wing against drag in modern birds) and an alula, much like a \"thumb-like\" form of leading edge slot, may indicate that \"Microraptor\" was capable of true, powered flight.",

This medullary bone, which is rich in calcium, is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur \"Allosaurus\" and the ornithopod \"Tenontosaurus\". Because the line of dinosaurs that includes \"Allosaurus\" and \"Tyrannosaurus\" diverged from the line that led to \"Tenontosaurus\" very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs. Another widespread trait among modern birds (but see below in regards to fossil groups and extant megapodes) is parental care for young after hatching. Jack Horner's 1978 discovery of a \"Maiasaura\" (\"good mother lizard\") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods. A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid \"Citipati osmolskae\" was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm.

Advanced and final stages of development are characterized by keeled elements with protuberances and an axis longer than 15 centimeters. Typically the plates are arranged in a longitudinal row in the midline, which shows bilateral symmetry. They also often match the dorsal curvature of the dinosaur. In order to distinguish between taxon of dinosaurs, scientists can evaluate the thickness of the osteoderm walls. They also analyze texture, some being smooth and other have patterned grooves. The internal structure of their osteoderms are variable as well. Some are compact and others are porus, with air pockets between them due to being highly vascularized. This variation in vasculature creates mixed histologies. The pattern of vascularization is not the same between all dinosaur species. Most have one or two vascular spaces near the midline, and then lead to a network of vascular spaces that branch to the dorsal side of the osteoderm. Based on the bone tissues found in fossils, it is thought that osteoderms may have developed from intramembranous ossification, a process where bone tissue replaces pre-existing tissue. This process in mainly supported by only extinct groups. More modern, extant reptile species are thought to develop osteoderms through metaplastic ossification, as discussed above. This process includes pre-existing and fully developed tissue becoming bone. This suggests that the bone development of these dinosaur species is not very well understood.

In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like \"Mamenchisaurus\". Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.",

            "document": "Hongshanornis . \"Hongshanornis longicresta\" was a small species, especially compared to other early ornithuromorphs (birds with a modern tail anatomy), about the size of a thrush, and adult specimens are estimated to have weighed about in life, with a wingspan of about . The skull in all known specimens is poorly preserved, but in general appears to have had a narrow snout compared to the closely related \"Longicrusavis\". The teeth were very small and are poorly preserved in all known specimens. At first, this led scientists to conclude that the teeth were absent in both the upper and lower jaws, probably replaced with a beak. However, later study of the type specimen showed that tooth sockets were present in the preserved parts of the jaw, and comparison with related forms showed that it did have teeth. The discovery of a more well preserved specimen confirmed the presence of teeth in at least the maxilla (middle of the upper jaw) and dentary (lower jaw). The snout appears to have lacked feathers, though whether it was only covered in skin or some parts bore a beak is currently unknown. The describers of \"Hongshanornis\" noted a unique bone in the end of the lower jaw which they equated with the beak-bearing \"predentary bone\" similar to the one found in ornithischian dinosaurs. Such bones have also been found in more advanced birds like \"Hesperornis\". However, other scientists have pointed out that the \"predentary\" (or, technically, \"mandibular symphysial ossification\") of \"Hongshanornis\" lacks the characteristic pits and grooves associated with the beak in early beaked birds like \"Archaeorhynchus\", and that the presence or absence of any beak is unclear.",

            "document": "Dinosaur reproduction . A discovery of features in a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" skeleton provided more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs. This \"medullary\" bone, which is rich in calcium, is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" specimen's hind limb suggested that \"T. rex\" used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod \"Allosaurus\" and the ornithopod \"Tenontosaurus\". Because the line of dinosaurs that includes \"Allosaurus\" and \"Tyrannosaurus\" diverged from the line that led to \"Tenontosaurus\" very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity rather quickly for such large animals.",

            "document": "Tyrannosaurus . Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has suggested that \"Tyrannosaurus\" may have been pack animals. Currie compared \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" favorably to related species \"Tarbosaurus bataar\" and \"Albertosaurus sarcophagus\", fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used to suggest that they lived in packs. Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" skeletons in close proximity to each other. After using CT scanning, Currie stated that \"Tyrannosaurus\" would have been capable of such complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that \"Tyrannosaurus\" had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as \"Triceratops\" of the same size. Currie believed \"Tyrannosaurus\" to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as \"Triceratops\" and \"Ankylosaurus\", were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for \"Tyrannosaurus\" to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by analogy to modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.",

            "document": "Plesiosauria . Traditionally, it was assumed that extinct reptile groups were cold-blooded like modern reptiles. New research during the past decades has led to the conclusion that some groups, such as theropod dinosaurs and pterosaurs, were very likely warm-blooded. Whether perhaps plesiosaurs were warm-blooded as well, is difficult to determine. One of the indications of a high metabolism is the presence of fast-growing fibrolamellar bone. The pachyostosis with juvenile individuals makes it hard to establish whether plesiosaurs possessed such bone, though. However, it has been possible to check its occurrence with more basal members of the more inclusive group plesiosaurs belonged to, the Sauropterygia. A study in 2010 concluded that fibrolamellar bone was originally present with sauropterygians. A subsequent publication in 2013 found that the Nothosauridae lacked this bone type, but that basal Pistosauria possessed it, a sign of a more elevated metabolism. It is thus more parsimonious to assume that the more derived pistosaurians, the plesiosaurs, also had a faster metabolism. A paper published in 2018 employing quantitative osteohistological model reveals that the bone growth rate and rest metabolic rate (RMR) for plesiosaurs are in the range of birds. Even for eosauropterygians the estimation values fall in the range of mammals or higher. Both results indicate endothermy for plesiosaurs, which might partially explain the success of plesiosaurs.",
