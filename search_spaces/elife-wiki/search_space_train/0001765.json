Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to oxidative stress response, such as antioxidants, chaperones, and heat-shock proteins.  Additionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the mTOR pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting S6K1, and also inhibits autophagy, a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products. Decline of autophagy causes neurodegeneration, protein aggregation and premature aging. Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters immune responses and stimulates cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors such as p16 and p21. This leads to alteration of the stem-cell niche and results in stem cell exhaustion, another theorized mechanism of aging.",

            "document": "Myosatellite cell . It is suggested that exercise triggers the release of signaling molecules including inflammatory substances, cytokines and growth factors from surrounding connective tissues and active skeletal muscles. Notably, HGF, a cytokine, is transferred from the extracellular matrix into muscles through the nitric-oxide dependent pathway. It is thought that HGF activates satellite cells, while insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) enhance satellite cell proliferation rate following activation. Studies have demonstrated that intense exercise generally increases IGF-1 production, though individual responses vary significantly. More specifically, IGF-1 exists in two isoforms: mechano growth factor (MGF) and IGF-IEa. While the former induces activation and proliferation, the latter causes differentiation of proliferating satellite cells.",

            "document": "Cell signaling . In some cases, receptor activation caused by ligand binding to a receptor is directly coupled to the cell's response to the ligand. For example, the neurotransmitter GABA can activate a cell surface receptor that is part of an ion channel. GABA binding to a GABA receptor on a neuron opens a chloride-selective ion channel that is part of the receptor. GABA receptor activation allows negatively charged chloride ions to move into the neuron, which inhibits the ability of the neuron to produce action potentials. However, for many cell surface receptors, ligand-receptor interactions are not directly linked to the cell's response. The activated receptor must first interact with other proteins inside the cell before the ultimate physiological effect of the ligand on the cell's behavior is produced. Often, the behavior of a chain of several interacting cell proteins is altered following receptor activation. The entire set of cell changes induced by receptor activation is called a signal transduction mechanism or pathway.",

Phagoptosis is normally caused by: the cell exposing on its surface so-called \"eat-me\" signals, and/or the cell no longer exposing \"don't-eat-me\" signals and/or the cell being opsonised i.e. binding soluble proteins that tag the cell for phagocytosis. For example, phosphatidylserine is an \"eat-me\" signal that, when exposed on the surface of a cell, triggers phagocytes (i.e. cells that eat other cells) to eat that cell. Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the inside of healthy cells, but can become exposed on the surface of dying, activated or stressed cells. Phagocytosis of such cells requires specific receptors on the phagocyte that recognise either phosphatidylserine directly or opsonins bound to the phosphatidylserine or other \"eat-me\" signals, such as calreticulin. \"Don't-eat-me\" signals include CD47, which when expressed on the surface of a cell, inhibit phagocytosis of that cell, by activating SIRP-alpha receptors on the phagocyte. Opsonins are normally soluble proteins, which when bound to the surface of a cell induce phagocytes to phagocytose that cell. Opsonins include Mfge8, Gas6, Protein S, antibodies and complement factors C1q and C3b.",

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, or sometimes with a Roman numeral as IGF-I) is mainly secreted by the liver as a result of stimulation by growth hormone (GH). IGF-1 is important for both the regulation of normal physiology, as well as a number of pathological states, including cancer. The IGF axis has been shown to play roles in the promotion of cell proliferation and the inhibition of cell death (apoptosis). Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2, or sometimes as IGF-II) is thought to be a primary growth factor required for early development while IGF-1 expression is required for achieving maximal growth. Gene knockout studies in mice have confirmed this, though other animals are likely to regulate the expression of these genes in distinct ways. While IGF-2 may be primarily fetal in action it is also essential for development and function of organs such as the brain, liver, and kidney.",

Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell.

The elastin receptor complex includes S-Gal, neuraminidase and Cathepsin A. When elastin-derived peptides bind to the S-Gal protein then the associated neuraminidase enzyme activity is activated and responding cells can have altered signal transduction involving extracellular signal-regulated kinases and regulated matrix metallopeptidase production. Elastin-derived peptides are chemotactic for some cell types and can alter cell cycle progression. The ability of the GLB1-derived elastin binding protein and the elastin receptor complex to influence cell proliferation appears to be indirect and involve removal of sialic acid from extracellular and cell surface proteins such as growth factor receptors.",
