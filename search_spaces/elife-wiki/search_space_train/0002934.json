Mouse-specific TLR11 recognizes uropathogenic \"E.coli\" and the apicomplexan parasite \"Toxoplasma gondii\". With \"Toxoplasma\" its ligand is the protein profilin, but the ligand for \"E. coli\" is still not known. Recently the enteropathogen \"Salmonella\" spp. was found to have a ligand which is bound by TLR11. Salmonella is a gram-negative flagellated bacterium which causes food- and waterborne gastroenteritis and typhoid fever in humans. TLR11 in mouse intestine recognizes the flagellun protein flagellin, causing dimerization of the receptor, activation of NF-\u03baB and production of inflammatory cytokines. TLR11 deficient mice (knockout mouse) are efficiently infected with orally administered Salmonella Typhi. \"S. Typhi\" does not normally infect mice, it is human obligatory pathogen that causes typhoid fever, which affects more than 20 million people and causes more than 220 thousand deaths per year. Because of this, studies were carried out and it was found that tlr-/- mice can be immunized against \"S. Typhi\" and they are used as an animal model for studying immune responses against this pathogen and for the development of vaccines, that could be possibly used in the future.",

Animal model studies indicate that TP receptor activation contracts vascular smooth muscle cells and acts on cardiac tissues to increase heart rate, trigger Cardiac arrhythmias, and produce myocardial ischemia. These effects may underlie, at least in part, the protective effects of TP gene knockout in mice. TP(-/-) mice are: a) resistant to the cardiogenic shock caused by infusion of the TP agonist, U46619, or the prostaglandin and thromboxane A precursor, arachidonic acid; b) partially protected from the cardiac damage caused by hypertension in IP-receptor deficient mice feed a high salt diet; c) prevented from developing angiotensin II-induced and N-Nitroarginine methyl ester-induced hypertension along with associated cardiac hypertrophy; d) resistant to the vascular damage caused by balloon catheter-induced injury of the external carotid artery; e) less likely to develop severe hepatic microcirculation dysfunction caused by TNF\u03b1 as well as kidney damage caused by TNF\u03b1 or bacteria-derived endotoxin; and f) slow in developing vascular atherosclerosis in ApoE gene knockout mice. In addition, TP receptor antagonists lessen myocardial infarct size in various animal models of this disease and block the cardiac dysfunction caused by extensive tissue ischemia in animal models of remote ischemic preconditioning. TP thereby has wide-ranging functions that tend to be detrimental to the cardiovascular network in animals and, most likely, humans. However, TP functions are not uniformly injurious to the cardiovascular system: TP receptor-depleted mice show an increase in cardiac damage as well as mortality due to trypanosoma cruzi infection. The mechanism[s) behind this putative protective effect and its applicability to humans is not yet known.",

From around 2005 on, the scientific community has thoroughly developed the concept of human microbiome and begun the systematic study to establish the relationship between the microbiome and human physiology in health and disease. We begin to understand that gut microbiota helps modulating host immunity at a systemic level. However, gut microbiome does not affect skin immunity significantly, instead, skin immunity is modulated by skin microflora according to the results obtained by Naik et al. Analyzing immunologic changes of germ-free (GF) mice with reconstituted gut microbiota showed a recovery of Il-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels up to those observed in the gastrointestinal tract of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice but gut microbiome restoration did not affect skin immunity. Comparing GF and SPF mice showed a decrease in the skin production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A. To evaluate the functional consequences of the absence of skin microbiota Leishmania major was introduced intradermally and the lesions were evaluated. L. major lesions in GF mice were significantly smaller and less severe than in SPF mice, however, the number of parasites after infection was significantly higher in GF mice. These results cearly indicate that GF mice have an impaired capacity of response in front of infections compared to SPF mice. Finally, mono-association of GF mice with \"S. epidermidis\" clearly restored immunity function which in the case of skin is mediated by IL-1 which is key for the restoration of IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Thus skin commensals exert their effect by enhancing IL-1 signaling and amplifying responses according to local inflammatory milieu. As IL-1 has been implicated in the etiology and pathology of psoriasis and other cutaneous disorders, it is likely that skin commensals are important drivers and amplifiers of skin pathologies.",

Amyloid is one of the peptides which accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer's Disease. A great debate had existed between Alzheimer's Disease researchers about the relevance of amyloid prior to the 1990s - many scientists believed amyloid was a tombstone of the disease and was not critical to the development of the disease. However, because the only difference between the family members who developed Alzheimer's Disease and those that did not in these families was the inheritance of the mutation in the amyloid gene this suggested that the amyloid protein itself could cause the disease. The idea that amyloid could cause the disease influenced scientific research until this day. Many experimental treatments are directed towards lowering amyloid levels in the brain. The other main effect the discovery of the Swedish mutation had was to provide one transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease. Transgenic mice (e.g. Tg2576) were made which overproduce human APP with the Swedish mutation. As a consequence, the mice can develop amyloid plaques at around 13 months old.",

An example of this is found in a study published in Nature, which showed that mice with a latent infection of a Herpesvirus were less susceptible to bacterial infections. Mice were infected with murine gammherpesvirus 68 (a member of the gammaherpesvirinae subfamily) and then challenged with \"Listeria monocytogenes\". The mice that had a latent infection of the virus had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria. The study went on to test mice with murine cytomegalovirus, a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which provided similar results. However, infection with human herpes simplex virus type-1, a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, did not provide increased resistance to bacterial infection. They also used \"Yersinia pestis\" (the causative agent of the Black Death) to challenge mice with a latent infection of gammaherpesvirus 68, and they found the mice did have an increased resistance to the bacteria. The suspected reason for this is that peritoneal macrophages in the mouse are activated after latent infection of the herpesvirus, and since macrophages play an important role in immunity, this provides the mouse with a stronger, active immune system at the time of bacterial exposure. It was found that the latent herpesvirus caused an increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), both of which lead to activation of macrophages and resistance to bacterial infection.",

Progress in proving the role of the 5-HETE family of agonists and their OXER1 receptor in human physiology and disease has been made difficult because mice, rats, and the other rodents so far tested lack OXER1. Rodents are the most common in vivo models for investigating these issues. OXER1 is expressed in non-human primates, a wide range of other mammals, and various fish species and a model of allergic airways disease in cats, which express OXER1 and make 5-oxo-ETE, has recently been developed for such studies. In any event, cultured mouse MA-10 Leydig cells, while responding to 5-oxo-ETE, lack OXER1. It is suggested that this cell's, as well as mouse and other rodent, responses to 5-oxo-ETE are mediated by a receptor closely related to OXER11 viz., the mouse niacin receptor 1, Niacr1. Niacr1, an ortholog of OXER1, is a G protein-coupled receptor for niacin, and responds to 5-oxo-ETE. It has also been suggested that one or more of the mouse hydroxycarboxylic acid (HCA) family of the G protein-coupled receptors, HCA1 (GPR81), HCA2 (GPR109A), and HCA3 (GPR109B), which are G protein-coupled receptors for fatty acids may be responsible for rodent responses to 5-oxo-ETE.

Serotonin has been identified in the offensive attack by male mice against intruder male mice. Mutants were made by manipulating a receptor for serotonin by deleting a gene for the serotonin receptor. These mutant male mice with the knockout alleles exhibited normal behavior in everyday activities such as eating and exploration, but when prompted, attacked intruders with twice the intensity of normal male mice. In offense aggression in mice, males with the same or similar genotypes were more likely to fight than males that encountered males of other genotypes. Another interesting finding in mice dealt with mice reared alone. These mice showed a strong tendency to attack other male mice upon their first exposure to the other animals. The mice reared alone were not taught to be more aggressive; they simply exhibited the behavior. This implicates the natural tendency related to biological aggression in mice since the mice reared alone lacked a parent to model aggressive behavior.",

Symptoms may vary from mild to severe and usually begin six to thirty days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. Weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and headaches also commonly occur. Diarrhea is uncommon and vomiting is not usually severe. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases there may be confusion. Without treatment, symptoms may last weeks or months. Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected; however, they are still able to spread the disease to others. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with paratyphoid fever. The cause is the bacterium \"Salmonella\" Typhi, also known as \"Salmonella enterica\" serotype Typhi, growing in the intestines and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include poor sanitation and poor hygiene. Those who travel to the developing world are also at risk and only humans can be infected. Diagnosis is by either culturing the bacteria or detecting the bacterium's DNA in the blood, stool, or bone marrow. Culturing the bacterium can be difficult. Bone marrow testing is the most accurate. Symptoms are similar to that of many other infectious diseases. Typhus is a different disease. A typhoid vaccine can prevent about 30% to 70% of cases during the first two years. The vaccine may have some effect for up to seven years. It is recommended for those at high risk or people traveling to areas where the disease is common. Other efforts to prevent the disease include providing clean drinking water, good sanitation, and handwashing. Until it has been confirmed that an individual's infection is cleared, the individual should not prepare food for others. Treatment of disease is with antibiotics such as azithromycin, fluoroquinolones or third generation cephalosporins. Resistance to these antibiotics has been developing, which has made treatment of the disease more difficult. In 2015, there were 12.5 million new cases worldwide. The disease is most common in India. Children are most commonly affected. Rates of disease decreased in the developed world in the 1940s as a result of improved sanitation and use of antibiotics to treat the disease. Each year in the United States, about 400 cases are reported and it is estimated that the disease occurs in about 6,000 people. In 2015, it resulted in about 149,000 deaths worldwide \u2013 down from 181,000 in 1990 (about 0.3% of the global total). The risk of death may be as high as 20% without treatment.

On the other hand, the immortalized human skin cell line HaCaT expresses BLT2 receptors and responds to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation by generating toxic reactive oxygen species which in turn cause the HaCaT cells to die by activating apoptotic pathways in a BLT2 receptor-dependent reaction. Topical treatment of mouse skin with a BLT2 receptor antagonist, LY255283, protects against UVB radiation-induced apoptosis and BLT2-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibited significantly more extensive skin apoptosis in response to UVB irradiation. Furthermore, 12-HHT inhibits HaCaT cells from synthesizing interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with cutaneous inflammation, in response to UVB radiation. These results suggest that the 12-HHT/BLT2 axis can act to suppress inflammation by promoting the orderly death of damaged cells and blocking IL-6 production. Opposition between the pro-inflammatory LTB4/BLT1 and anti-inflammatory actions of the 12-HHT/BLT2 axes occurs in another setting. In a mice model of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease, 12-HHT and its companion cyclooxygenase metabolites, Prostaglandin E2 and Prostaglandin D2, but not 12 other lipoxygenase or cycloxygenase mebolites showed a statistically significantly increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels after intratracheal ovalbumin challenge; after this challenge, only 12-HHT, among the monitored BLT2 receptor-activating ligands (LTB4, the 12(\"S\") stereoisomer of 12-HETE, and 15(\"S\")-HETE) attained levels capable of activating BLT2 receptors.

However, there are obvious limitations inherent in using animals for modelling genetically determined diseases in humans. Despite a large proportion of genetic conservation between humans and mice, there are significant differences between the biology of mice and humans that are important to cancer research. For example, major differences in telomere regulation enable murine cells to bypass the requirement for telomerase upregulation, which is a rate-limiting step in human cancer formation. As another example, certain ligand-receptor interactions are incompatible between mice and humans. Additionally, experiments have demonstrated important and significant differences in the ability to transform cells, compared with cells of murine origin. For these reasons, it remains essential to develop models of cancer that employ human cells.",

They participate in effective antimicrobial defence through the production of IL-17 and IL-22. The role of IL-22 in humans and mice is somewhat different. In the murine model, IL-22 was found to play a role in improving the course of inflammatory bowel disease and epithelial restoration in the loss of the protective mucin barrier in the large intestine. However, in humans with inflammatory bowel disease, IL-22 has an effect on the pathology of the disease. IL-22 is an important cytokine for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The action of IL-22 helps enhance the defense of the surface of the intestinal mucosa by weakening the mucin layer and its ability to produce antimicrobial agents, such as \u03b2-defensins, is a powerful mechanism that helps maintain intestinal homeostasis.An increase in IL-22 levels together with increased \u03b2-defensin expression has been reported in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. IL-22, as well as IL-17, could thus be involved in the development of these skin diseases, since in humans without these problems IL-22 expression was not registered. The effects of IL-17 and IL-22 can complement each other and stimulate an increased amount of antimicrobial peptides at the site of action . Like ILC2, ILC 3 can express MHC II and be appropriating the function of antigen presenting cells. However, ILCs lack the costimulatory receptors that are necessary for proper activation and initiation of the immune response. ILCs, on the contrary, may set the helper T lymphocytes in the state of anergy. In the case of ILC 3, the ability to express MHC II apparently serves to maintain tolerance to commensal bacteria in the intestine. They suppress the response of CD4 + T lymphocytes to harmless and beneficial intestinal bacteria. If this tolerance is not maintained, there can be a development of undesirable pathological conditions . On the other hand, the action of IL-23 or IL-17 is not always beneficial. It causes some autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. IL-17A specifically targets keratinocytes and is the major cytokine causing pathogenesis of skin psoriasis. In addition, IL-17A is also expressed to an increasing extent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ILC 3 may play a role already in the prenatal setting of the body's resistance to infections. LTi cells are important in the origin and development of secondary lymphoid organs. It has been found that differentiation and signalling of LTi cells are dependent on retinoic acid (a component of vitamin A). The uptake of retinoic acid in the diet by the mother directly affects the development of LTi cells and the size of the secondary lymphoid organs of the fetus, which may have an effect at its later age",

The high affinity BLT2 receptor agonist, 12-HHT, stimulates in vitro chemotactic responses in human neutrophils, suggesting that this receptor, similar to BLT1 receptors, contributes to inflammation by recruiting circulating blood neutrophils to disturbed tissue sites. Other studies, however, indicate that the role of BLT2 receptors in inflammation is directed toward other cell types than neutrophils and differs very much from that of BLT1 receptors. Immortalized human skin keratinocyte HaCaT cells respond to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation by generating toxic reactive oxygen species which in turn triggers the cells to become apoptotic and eventually die. This response is BLT2 receptor-dependent since a) topical treatment of mouse skin with a BLT2 receptor antagonist, LY255283, protects against UVB radiation-induced apoptosis; b) BLT2-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit more extensive skin apoptosis in response to UVB irradiation that wild type mice; and c) 12-HHT inhibits HaCaT cells from synthesizing the pro-inflammation mediator, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in response to UVB radiation. Furthermore, BLT2 receptor knock-out mice mount of more severe intestinal inflammation response to dextran sodium sulfate than either wild type or BLT1 receptor knockout mice (see Knockout studies). Thus, BLT2 receptors appear responsible for suppressing UVB-induced skin inflammation and, in contrast to BLT1 receptors, oppose the development and thereby dampen the severity of experimental colitis in mice.",

Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with \"Rickettsia australis\" occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an \"eschar\", usually 2\u20135\u00a0mm in diameter) at the site of the tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1\u201314 days (usually 7\u201310 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland.

This bacterium invades and proliferates in neutrophil cells of the blood. This depletes these antibacterial cells and renders the host susceptible to opportunistic infections by \"Staphylococcus aureus\" bacteria which invade joints and cause the crippling disease of sheep called tick pyaemia. \"Anaplasma marginale\" infects marginal areas of red blood cells of cattle and causes anaplasmosis wherever boophilid ticks occur as transmitters. \"Anaplasma centrale\" tends to infect the central region of red blood cells, and is sufficiently closely related to \"An. marginale\" to have been used from long ago as a live vaccine to protect cattle against the more virulent \"An. marginale\". Sheep and goats suffer disease from infection with \"Anaplasma ovis\" which is transmitted similarly to the anaplasmas described above. \"Ehrlichia ruminantium\" (formerly \"Cowdria ruminantium\") is transmitted mainly by \"Amblyomma hebraeum\" and \"Am. variegatum\" in Africa, causing the severe disease heartwater in cattle, sheep, and goats.

An example of this is found in a study published in Nature, which showed that mice with a latent infection of a Herpesvirus were less susceptible to bacterial infections. Mice were infected with murine gammherpesvirus 68 (a member of the gammaherpesvirinae subfamily) and then challenged with \"Listeria monocytogenes\". The mice that had a latent infection of the virus had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria. The study went on to test mice with murine cytomegalovirus, a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which provided similar results. However, infection with human herpes simplex virus type-1, a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, did not provide increased resistance to bacterial infection. They also used \"Yersinia pestis\" (the causative agent of the Black Death) to challenge mice with a latent infection of gammaherpesvirus 68, and they found the mice did have an increased resistance to the bacteria. The suspected reason for this is that peritoneal macrophages in the mouse are activated after latent infection of the herpesvirus, and since macrophages play an important role in immunity, this provides the mouse with a stronger, active immune system at the time of bacterial exposure. It was found that the latent herpesvirus caused an increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), both of which lead to activation of macrophages and resistance to bacterial infection.",

Animals such as cows, sheep, goats, and camels may be affected. In these animals it is spread mostly by mosquitoes. It does not appear that one person can infect another person. The disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies against the virus or the virus itself in the blood. Prevention of the disease in humans is accomplished by vaccinating animals against the disease. This must be done before an outbreak occurs because if it is done during an outbreak it may worsen the situation. Stopping the movement of animals during an outbreak may also be useful, as may decreasing mosquito numbers and avoiding their bites. There is a human vaccine; however, as of 2010 it is not widely available. There is no specific treatment and medical efforts are supportive. Outbreaks of the disease have only occurred in Africa and Arabia. Outbreaks usually occur during periods of increased rain which increase the number of mosquitoes.

            "document": "Lyme disease . Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the \"Borrelia\" type which is spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that begins at the site of a tick bite about a week after it has occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25\u201350% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months. Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks of the genus \"Ixodes\". Usually, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours before the bacteria can spread. In North America, \"Borrelia burgdorferi\" and \"Borrelia mayonii\" are the cause. In Europe and Asia, the bacteria \"Borrelia afzelii\" and \"Borrelia garinii\" are also causes of the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals, or through food. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. Prevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites such as by wearing long pants and using DEET. Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. Ticks can be removed using tweezers. If the removed tick was full of blood, a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent development of infection, but is not generally recommended since development of infection is rare. If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment which may last for one or two days. In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. Lyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. It is estimated to affect 300,000 people a year in the United States and 65,000 people a year in Europe. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Old Lyme, Connecticut. It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer. Chronic symptoms following treatment are well described and are known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). PTLDS is different to chronic Lyme disease; a no longer supported term used in different ways by different groups. Some healthcare providers claim that it is due to ongoing infection; however, this is not believed to be true, due to the inability to detect infectious organisms after standard treatment. A Lyme vaccine was marketed in the US between 1998 and 2002; it was withdrawn from the market due to poor sales, originally due to lack of reimbursement by insurance companies and then due to rumors about adverse effects. Research is ongoing to develop new vaccines.",
