ERX-11, also known as ER\u03b1 coregulator-binding modulator-11, is a novel antiestrogen and experimental hormonal antineoplastic agent which is being researched for the potential treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is not a competitive antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) like conventional antiestrogens such as tamoxifen or fulvestrant; instead of binding to the ligand-binding site of the ER, ERX-11 interacts with a different part of the ER\u03b1 and blocks protein\u2013protein interactions of the ER\u03b1 with coregulators that are necessary for the receptor to act and regulate gene expression. It was designed to bind to the coregulator binding region of the ER\u03b1 and inhibit the ER\u03b1/coactivator interaction, although its precise binding site and mode of action have yet to be fully elucidated and understood. Nonetheless, it is clear that ERX-11 binds within the AF-2 domain of the ER\u03b1.",

When inactive the progesterone receptor, as for other steroid receptor, forms a complex consisting of itself, heat shock proteins (hsp70, hsp90) and immunophilins. Upon activation, due to hormone binding to ligand binding pocket, the receptor complex has been shown to dissociate, triggering nuclear import and giving the receptor the property of dimerisation (Fig. 3). In the nucleus the dimer interacts with progesterone hormone response element in the DNA causing upregulation or downregulation of the gene. Various studies have demonstrated that it affects expression of up to 100 different genes, depending on receptor isomer. In the action of agonism there occur conformational changes, where alpha helices 3, 4 and 12 create a docking surface for coactivator proteins, which act as bridging factors between the receptor and the general transcription machinery. However, the antagonist prevents proper packing of alpha helix 12 against helices 3 and 4, impairing the receptor\u2019s ability to interact with coactivators, which allows recruitment of corepressor, such as SMRT and NCoR. Due to the minimal recruitment of corepressors during agonist binding then there has been postulated by Liu et al., 2002, that the ratio between coactivators vs. corepressors recruitment might be the determinant whether compound is considered to be an agonist, antagonist or mixed agonist-antagonist. The selective progesterone receptor modulators have been described as agents with mixed agonist-antagonist activity and thus the mechanism of action must be due to a balance of these functions.",

The classical estrogen receptors first characterized in 1958 are water-soluble proteins located in the interior of cells that are activated by estrogenenic hormones such as estradiol and several of its metabolites such as estrone or estriol. These proteins belong to the nuclear hormone receptor class of transcription factors that regulate gene transcription. Since it takes time for genes to be transcribed into RNA and translated into protein, the effects of estrogens binding to these classical estrogen receptors is delayed. However, estrogens are also known to have effects that are too fast to be caused by regulation of gene transcription. In 2005, it was discovered that a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, GPR30 also binds with high affinity to estradiol and is responsible in part for the rapid non-genomic actions of estradiol. Based on its ability to bind estradiol, GPR30 was renamed as G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER).

These experiments address various important questions in evolutionary biology: does evolution proceed in small steps or in large leaps; is evolution reversible; how does complexity evolve? It has been shown that slight mutations in the amino acid sequence of hormone receptors determine an important change in their preferences for hormones. These changes mean huge steps in the evolution of the endocrine system. Thus very small changes at the molecular level may have enormous consequences. The Thornton lab has also been able to show that evolution is irreversible studying the glucocorticoid receptor. This receptor was changed by seven mutations in a cortisol receptor, but reversing these mutations didn't give the original receptor back. Indicating that epistasis plays a major role in protein evolution \u2013 an observation that in combination with the observations of several examples of parallel evolution, support the neutral network model mentioned above. Other earlier neutral mutations acted as a ratchet and made the changes to the receptor irreversible. These different experiments on receptors show that, during their evolution, proteins are greatly differentiated and this explains how complexity may evolve. A closer look at the different ancestral hormone receptors and the various hormones shows that at the level of interaction between single amino acid residues and chemical groups of the hormones arise by very small but specific changes. Knowledge about these changes may for example lead to the synthesis of hormonal equivalents capable of mimicking or inhibiting the action of a hormone, which might open possibilities for new therapies.",

It is a silent antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) with no intrinsic estrogenic activity and hence is a pure antiestrogen, unlike selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen. The drug was under development by AstraZeneca for the treatment of breast cancer but was discontinued in favor of fulvestrant, which is very similar to ICI-164384 but is more potent in comparison.",

In mouse xenograft models, Menerba produced a different conformation in estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) from ER\u03b2 when compared with the conformations produced by estradiol. The specific conformational change induced by Menerba allows ER\u03b2 to bind to an estrogen response element and recruit coregulatory proteins that are required for gene activation. It has been shown that the increased risk of breast and uterine cancers is associated with ER\u03b1 activation and that ER\u03b2 blocks the growth promoting effects on breast cancer cells. Menerba does not activate the ER\u03b1-regulated proliferative genes, c-myc and cyclin D1, or stimulate MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation or tumor formation, demonstrating that it may be a viable alternative for hormone therapy in comparison to estrogens that non-selectively activate both ER subtypes.",

Some members of this family, such as tamoxifen, are actually partial agonists, which can actually \"increase\" estrogen receptor signalling in some tissues, such as the endometrium. Tamoxifen is currently first-line treatment for nearly all pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Raloxifene is another partial agonist SERM which does not seem to promote endometrial cancer, and is used primarily for chemoprevention of breast cancer in high-risk individuals, as well as to prevent osteoporosis. Toremifene and fulvestrant are SERMs with little or no agonist activity, and are used for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.",

Estradiol affects target tissues mainly by interacting with two nuclear receptors called estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) and estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2). One of the functions of these estrogen receptors is the modulation of gene expression. Once estradiol binds to the ERs, the receptor complexes then bind to specific DNA sequences, possibly causing damage to the DNA and an increase in cell division and DNA replication. Eukaryotic cells respond to damaged DNA by stimulating or impairing G1, S, or G2 phases of the cell cycle to initiate DNA repair. As a result, cellular transformation and cancer cell proliferation occurs.",

That is the reason that compounds that inhibit biosynthesis of estrogen have been researched and are now the standard adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It has been proven that breast cancer in postmenopausal women can be treated or prevented by modulating the estrogen receptors or its ligands and as aromatase is part of the final step in estrogen conversion it is a good target for medicine. Because aromatase catalyses the final step in estrogen conversion, inhibiting it does not have any effect on synthesis of other steroids except estrogen.",

They can pack several different sizes and types of dendrimers and several different types of ligands in order to effectively treat different types of cancers. For example, research shows that 80~90% of breast cancer\u2019s tumor cells have estrogen receptors and 60~70% of prostate cancer\u2019s tumor cells have androgen receptors. These significant amount of hormone receptors play a role in intermolecular actions. This role is now used by targeting and therapeutic ligands on gold nanoparticles to target tissue-selective anti-tumor drug delivery. In order to have multiple targeting and therapeutic ligands bind with gold nanoparticles, the gold nanoparticles must first undergo polymer stabilization. Then, anti-estrogen molecules with thiolated PEG are bound to gold nanoparticles via Au-S bonds, forming thiolate protected gold nanoparticles. Docetaxel is packed into PEGylated gold nanoparticles Docetaxel is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy medicine which showing great performance in clinical trial. Docetaxel was approved by FDA, to treat several different kinds of cancer. i.e. breast cancer(include locally advanced or metastatic).",
