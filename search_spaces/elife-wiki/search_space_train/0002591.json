This pathway involves changes of protein\u2013protein interactions inside the cell, induced by an external signal. Many growth factors bind to receptors at the cell surface and stimulate cells to progress through the cell cycle and divide. Several of these receptors are kinases that start to phosphorylate themselves and other proteins when binding to a ligand. This phosphorylation can generate a binding site for a different protein and thus induce protein\u2013protein interaction. In Figure 3, the ligand (called epidermal growth factor (EGF)) binds to the receptor (called EGFR). This activates the receptor to phosphorylate itself. The phosphorylated receptor binds to an adaptor protein (GRB2), which couples the signal to further downstream signaling processes. For example, one of the signal transduction pathways that are activated is called the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The signal transduction component labeled as \"MAPK\" in the pathway was originally called \"ERK,\" so the pathway is called the MAPK/ERK pathway. The MAPK protein is an enzyme, a protein kinase that can attach phosphate to target proteins such as the transcription factor MYC and, thus, alter gene transcription and, ultimately, cell cycle progression. Many cellular proteins are activated downstream of the growth factor receptors (such as EGFR) that initiate this signal transduction pathway.",

G-proteins exist as a heterotrimer; they are composed of three distinct subunits. When the molecule GDP is bound to the G-protein subunit, the G-protein is in an inactive state. Following binding of the chemokine ligand, chemokine receptors associate with G-proteins, allowing the exchange of GDP for another molecule called GTP, and the dissociation of the different G protein subunits. The subunit called G\u03b2 activates an enzyme known as Phospholipase C (PLC) that is associated with the cell membrane. PLC cleaves Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) to form two second messenger molecules called inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG); DAG activates another enzyme called protein kinase C (PKC), and IP3 triggers the release of calcium from intracellular stores. These events promote many signaling cascades, effecting a cellular response. For example, when CXCL8 (IL-8) binds to its specific receptors, CXCR1 or CXCR2, a rise in intracellular calcium activates the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) that goes on to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade called the MAP kinase pathway. At the same time the G-protein subunit G\u03b1 directly activates an enzyme called protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), which phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in the tail of the chemokine receptor, causing its desensitisation or inactivation. The initiated MAP kinase pathway activates specific cellular mechanisms involved in chemotaxis, degranulation, release of superoxide anions, and changes in the avidity of cell adhesion molecules called integrins. Chemokines and their receptors play a crucial role in cancer metastatis as they are involved in extravastation, migration, micrometastatis, and angiogenesis. This role of chemokine is strikingly similar to their normal function of localizing leukocytes to an inflammatory site.",

Each G protein is a heterotrimer of three subunits: \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3- subunits. The \u03b1-subunit (G) typically binds the G protein to a transmembrane receptor protein known as a G protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR. This receptor protein has a large, extracellular binding domain which will bind its respective ligands (e.g. neurotransmitters and hormones). Once the ligand is bound to its receptor, a conformational change occurs. This conformational change in the G protein allows G to bind GTP. This leads to yet another conformational change in the G protein, resulting in the separation of the \u03b2\u03b3-complex (G) from G. At this point, both G and G are active and able to continue the signal transduction pathway. Different classes of G protein-coupled receptors have many known functions including the cAMP and Phosphatidylinositol signal transduction pathways. A class known as metabotropic glutamate receptors play a large role in indirect ion channel activation by G proteins.

            "document": "Biochemical cascade . The main goal of biochemical cascades in lymphocytes is the secretion of molecules that can suppress altered cells or eliminate pathogenic agents, through proliferation, differentiation and activation of these cells. Therefore, the antigenic receptors play a central role in signal transduction in lymphocytes, because when antigens interact with them lead to a cascade of signal events. These receptors, that recognize the antigen soluble (B cells) or linked to a molecule on Antigen Presenting Cells (T cells), don't have long cytoplasm tails, so they are anchored to signal proteins, which contain a long cytoplasmic tails with a motif that can be phosphorylated (ITAM \u2013 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and resulting in different signal pathways. The antigen receptor and signal protein form a stable complex, named BCR or TCR, in B or T cells, respectively. The family Src is essential for signal transduction in these cells, because it's responsible for phosphorylation of ITAMs. Therefore, Lyn and Lck, in lymphocytes B and T, respectively, phosphorylate ITAMs after the antigen recognition and the conformational change of the receptor, which leads to the binding of Syk/Zap-70 kinases to ITAM and its activation. Syk kinase is specific of lymphocytes B and Zap-70 is present in T cells. After activation of these enzymes, some adaptor proteins are phosphorylated, like BLNK (B cells) and LAT (T cells). These proteins after phosphorylation become activated and allow binding of others enzymes that continue the biochemical cascade. One example of a protein that binds to adaptor proteins and become activated is PLC that is very important in the lymphocyte signal pathways. PLC is responsible for PKC activation, via DAG and Ca, which leads to phosphorylation of CARMA1 molecule, and formation of CBM complex. This complex activates I\u03ba\u03ba kinase, which phosphorylates I-\u03baB, and then allows the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and transcription of genes encoding cytokines, for example. Others transcriptional factors like NFAT and AP1 complex are also important for transcription of cytokines. The differentiation of B cells to plasma cells is also an example of a signal mechanism in lymphocytes, induced by a cytokine receptor. In this case, some interleukins bind to a specific receptor, which leads to activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. Consequently, the BLIMP1 protein is translated and inhibits PAX5, allowing immunoglobulin genes transcription and activation of XBP1 (important for the secretory apparatus formation and enhancing of protein synthesis). Also, the coreceptors (CD28/CD19) play an important role because they can improve the antigen/receptor binding and initiate parallel cascade events, like activation o PI3 Kinase. PIP3 then is responsible for activation of several proteins, like vav (leads to activation of JNK pathway, which consequently leads to activation of c-Jun) and btk (can also activate PLC).",

The domains involved in Wnt/calcium signaling are the PDZ and DEP domains. However, unlike other Wnt pathways, the Fz receptor directly interfaces with a trimeric G-protein. This co-stimulation of Dsh and the G-protein can lead to the activation of either PLC or cGMP-specific PDE. If PLC is activated, the plasma membrane component PIP2 is cleaved into DAG and IP3.

Increased calcium also activates calcineurin and CaMKII. CaMKII induces activation of the transcription factor NFAT, which regulates cell adhesion, migration and tissue separation. Calcineurin activates TAK1 and NLK kinase, which can interfere with TCF/\u00df-Catenin signaling in the canonical Wnt pathway. However, if PDE is activated, calcium release from the ER is inhibited.

To have the ability to fertilize the female gamete, this cell suffers capacitation and acrosome reaction in female reproductive tract. The signaling pathways best described for spermatozoon involve these processes. The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway leads to sperm cells capacitation; however, adenilyl cyclase in sperm cells is different from the somatic cells. Adenilyl cyclase in spermatozoon doesn't recognize G proteins, so it is stimulated by bicarbonate and Ca ions. Then, it converts ATP into cAMP, which activates PKA. PKA leads to protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Phospholipase C (PLC) is involved in acrosome reaction. ZP3 is a glycoprotein present in zona pelucida and it interacts with receptors in spermatozoon. So, ZP3 can activate G protein coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors, that leads to production of PLC.

IP3 is released as a soluble structure into the cytosol and DAG remains bound to the membrane. IP3 binds to IP3 receptors, present in acrosome membrane. In addition, calcium and DAG together work to activate protein kinase C, which goes on to phosphorylate other molecules, leading to altered cellular activity.

When ROS (reactive oxygen species) are present in high concentration, they can affect the physiology of cells, but when they are present in moderated concentration they are important for acrosome reaction and capacitation.

SFRP1 are heparin-binding proteins, with the heparin-binding domain within the C-terminal region of the SFRP1 protein. In vitro studies show that SFRP1 is stabilizezd by heparin, suggesting that heparin or endogenous heparan-sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) has the potential to promote SFRP1/Wnt binding by serving as a scaffold to facilitate interaction between SFRP1 and Wnt proteins. Lowering HSPG levels in tissue have been shown to impair Wnt signaling in vivo, supporting the idea that HSPG plays an important role in Wnt signaling regulation. Furthermore, SFRP1 is tyrosine-sulfated at two N-terminal tyrosines; this modification is, however, inhibited by heparin. Tryosine sulfation could partially destabilize the SFRP1 protein, which is supported by previous studies showing that SFRP1 is susceptible to degradation in the absence of heparin. The finding that heparin can inhibit intracellular post-translational modification of SFRP1 was surprising. This indicates that heparin may inhibit the process of tyrosine sulfation, for example, by tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferases enzymes or sulfate donor pathways. Since heparin is highly negatively charged and cannot permeate the membrane, it must activate a signal transduction pathway to carry out its effect. It is well known that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) bind heparin with relatively high affinity. HSPGs have also been shown to be involved in FGF cell signaling. Zhong et al. revealed a specificity of FGFs and FGF receptors on SFRP1 accumulation, demonstrating that FGF and their receptors are involved in post-translational modification of SFRP1.

Thus, Heparin is a potential drug that could be used to stabilize and accumulate SFRP1 in cancer cells.",

The complex then dissociate into its G\u03b1 and G components which act to regulate cell signaling pathways. In particular, G\u03b1 stimulates adenyl cyclase to raise cellular levels of cAMP; cAMP activates PKA, a kinase which in turn activates signaling molecules, in particular, the transcription factor, CREB. Activated CREB stimulates the expression of genes such as c-fos, somatostatin, and corticotropin-releasing hormone that regulate cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, cellular survival, and angiogenesis. EP activation of G proteins also activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR, ERK, and p38 MARK pathways.

Specific proteins containing these domains include Src and phospholipase C\u03b3. Phosphorylation and activation of these two proteins on receptor binding lead to the initiation of signal transduction pathways. Other proteins that interact with the activated receptor act as adaptor proteins and have no intrinsic enzymatic activity of their own. These adaptor proteins link RTK activation to downstream signal transduction pathways, such as the MAP kinase signalling cascade. An example of a vital signal transduction pathway involves the tyrosine kinase receptor, c-met, which is required for the survival and proliferation of migrating myoblasts during myogenesis. A lack of c-met disrupts secondary myogenesis and\u2014as in LBX1\u2014prevents the formation of limb musculature.

SFRP1 are heparin-binding proteins, with the heparin-binding domain within the C-terminal region of the SFRP1 protein. In vitro studies show that SFRP1 is stabilizezd by heparin, suggesting that heparin or endogenous heparan-sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) has the potential to promote SFRP1/Wnt binding by serving as a scaffold to facilitate interaction between SFRP1 and Wnt proteins. Lowering HSPG levels in tissue have been shown to impair Wnt signaling in vivo, supporting the idea that HSPG plays an important role in Wnt signaling regulation. Furthermore, SFRP1 is tyrosine-sulfated at two N-terminal tyrosines; this modification is, however, inhibited by heparin. Tryosine sulfation could partially destabilize the SFRP1 protein, which is supported by previous studies showing that SFRP1 is susceptible to degradation in the absence of heparin. The finding that heparin can inhibit intracellular post-translational modification of SFRP1 was surprising. This indicates that heparin may inhibit the process of tyrosine sulfation, for example, by tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferases enzymes or sulfate donor pathways. Since heparin is highly negatively charged and cannot permeate the membrane, it must activate a signal transduction pathway to carry out its effect. It is well known that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) bind heparin with relatively high affinity. HSPGs have also been shown to be involved in FGF cell signaling. Zhong et al. revealed a specificity of FGFs and FGF receptors on SFRP1 accumulation, demonstrating that FGF and their receptors are involved in post-translational modification of SFRP1. As stated above, SFRP1 has been shown to attenuate the malignant phenotype and decrease the growth of tumors. Thus, Heparin is a potential drug that could be used to stabilize and accumulate SFRP1 in cancer cells.",

Examples include lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-5/6, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), and ROR2. Upon activation of the receptor, a signal is sent to the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (Dsh), which is located in the cytoplasm. This signal is transmitted via a direct interaction between Fz and Dsh. Dsh proteins are present in all organisms and they all share the following highly conserved protein domains: an amino-terminal DIX domain, a central PDZ domain, and a carboxy-terminal DEP domain. These different domains are important because after Dsh, the Wnt signal can branch off into multiple pathways and each pathway interacts with a different combination of the three domains.",

This co-stimulation of Dsh and the G-protein can lead to the activation of either PLC or cGMP-specific PDE. If PLC is activated, the plasma membrane component PIP2 is cleaved into DAG and IP3. When IP3 binds its receptor on the ER, calcium is released. Increased concentrations of calcium and DAG can activate Cdc42 through PKC. Cdc42 is an important regulator of ventral patterning. Increased calcium also activates calcineurin and CaMKII. CaMKII induces activation of the transcription factor NFAT, which regulates cell adhesion, migration and tissue separation. Calcineurin activates TAK1 and NLK kinase, which can interfere with TCF/\u00df-Catenin signaling in the canonical Wnt pathway. However, if PDE is activated, calcium release from the ER is inhibited.

The main goal of biochemical cascades in lymphocytes is the secretion of molecules that can suppress altered cells or eliminate pathogenic agents, through proliferation, differentiation and activation of these cells. Therefore, the antigenic receptors play a central role in signal transduction in lymphocytes, because when antigens interact with them lead to a cascade of signal events. These receptors, that recognize the antigen soluble (B cells) or linked to a molecule on Antigen Presenting Cells (T cells), don't have long cytoplasm tails, so they are anchored to signal proteins, which contain a long cytoplasmic tails with a motif that can be phosphorylated (ITAM \u2013 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and resulting in different signal pathways. The antigen receptor and signal protein form a stable complex, named BCR or TCR, in B or T cells, respectively. The family Src is essential for signal transduction in these cells, because it's responsible for phosphorylation of ITAMs. Therefore, Lyn and Lck, in lymphocytes B and T, respectively, phosphorylate ITAMs after the antigen recognition and the conformational change of the receptor, which leads to the binding of Syk/Zap-70 kinases to ITAM and its activation. Syk kinase is specific of lymphocytes B and Zap-70 is present in T cells. After activation of these enzymes, some adaptor proteins are phosphorylated, like BLNK (B cells) and LAT (T cells). These proteins after phosphorylation become activated and allow binding of others enzymes that continue the biochemical cascade. One example of a protein that binds to adaptor proteins and become activated is PLC that is very important in the lymphocyte signal pathways. PLC is responsible for PKC activation, via DAG and Ca, which leads to phosphorylation of CARMA1 molecule, and formation of CBM complex. This complex activates I\u03ba\u03ba kinase, which phosphorylates I-\u03baB, and then allows the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and transcription of genes encoding cytokines, for example. Others transcriptional factors like NFAT and AP1 complex are also important for transcription of cytokines. The differentiation of B cells to plasma cells is also an example of a signal mechanism in lymphocytes, induced by a cytokine receptor. In this case, some interleukins bind to a specific receptor, which leads to activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. Consequently, the BLIMP1 protein is translated and inhibits PAX5, allowing immunoglobulin genes transcription and activation of XBP1 (important for the secretory apparatus formation and enhancing of protein synthesis). Also, the coreceptors (CD28/CD19) play an important role because they can improve the antigen/receptor binding and initiate parallel cascade events, like activation o PI3 Kinase. PIP3 then is responsible for activation of several proteins, like vav (leads to activation of JNK pathway, which consequently leads to activation of c-Jun) and btk (can also activate PLC).",
