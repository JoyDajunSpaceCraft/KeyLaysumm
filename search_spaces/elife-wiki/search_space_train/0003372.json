Mutations in the genes that encode the proteins Parkin, PINK1, alpha-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) or the protein deglycase DJ-1 have been linked to this disease through research. However, further research is still being considered in order to determine the direct correlations of these genes to Parkinson\u2019s disease. In normal conditions, these genes are believed to be responsible for the cells ability to degrade mitochondria that has been rendered nonfunctional in a process known as mitophagy. However, mutations in the Parkin and pink1 genes have been associated with the cells becoming incapable of degrading faulty mitochondria. The proteins alpha-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and DJ-1 have been shown to promote MAM function interaction between the ER and the mitochondria. The wild-type gene that codes for \u03b1-Syn promotes the physical junction between ER and mitochondria by binding to the lipid raft regions of the MAM. However, the mutant form of this gene has a low affinity to the lipid raft regions, thereby diminishing the contact between the ER and mitochondria and causing accumulation of \u03b1-Syn in Lewy bodies which is a major characteristic of PD. Further research on PD association with alterations in MAM is still being developed.",

The A53T mutation has been shown have faster kinetics of fibrilization than the wild-type protein. A53T alpha-synuclein has also been linked to early on-set familial Parkinson's disease. Advancements in technology have allowed the development of transgenic mice expressing A53T alpha-synuclein that have been used in multiple studies on Parkinson's disease. Wild-type alpha-synuclein has been shown to form oligomeric species termed protofibrils before forming full fibrils. Research has been conducted to test the hypothesis that the oligomeric protofibril species is neurotoxic rather than the fibrillar species. Electron microscopy has revealed that the A53T mutant protein formed annular and tubular protofibrils easily, whereas the wild-type protein formed annular protofibrils only after extended incubation. This early on-set mutation has been shown to increase the protofibril population that, if toxic, would increase the amount of the toxic species in the brain. There is clinical significance in studying the effects of A53T alpha-synuclein on the protofibrillar species as it may be a relevant therapeutic target in treating early on-set Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

The inflammatory response in the gut may play a role in alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) aggregation and misfolding, a characteristic of Parkinson's disease pathology. If there is a balance between good bacteria and bad bacteria in the gut, the bacteria may remain contained to the gut. However, dysbiosis of good bacteria and bad bacteria may cause a \u201cleaky\u201d gut, creating an inflammatory response. This response aids \u03b1-Syn misfolding and transfer across neurons, as the protein works its way up to the CNS. The brainstem is vulnerable to inflammation, which would explain Stage 2 of Braak's hypothesis, including sleep disturbances and depression. In Stage 3 of the hypothesis, the inflammation affects the substantia nigra, the dopamine producing cells of the brain, beginning the characteristic motor deficits of Parkinson's disease. Stage 4 of Parkinson's disease includes deficits caused by inflammation in key regions of the brain that regulate executive function and memory. As evidence supporting Braak's hypothesis, patients in Stage 3 (motor deficits) that are not experiencing cognitive deficits already show that there is neuroinflammation of the cortex.

Parkinson\u2019s disease is characterized by inclusions of a protein called alpha-synuclien (Lewy bodies) in affected neurons that cells cannot break down. Deregulation of the autophagy pathway and mutation of alleles regulating autophagy are believed to cause neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is essential for neuronal survival. Without efficient autophagy, neurons gather ubiquitinated protein aggregates and degrade. Ubiquitinated proteins are proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin to get degraded. Mutations of synuclien alleles lead to lysosome pH increase and hydrolase inhibition. As a result, lysosomes degradative capacity is decreased. There are several genetic mutations implicated in the disease, including loss of function PINK1 and Parkin. Loss of function in these genes can lead to damaged mitochondrial accumulation and protein aggregates than can lead to cellular degeneration. Mitochondria is involved in Parkinson's disease.

According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings proposed by Heiko Braak, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death and they may be protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein.

Monomeric \u03b1-synuclein is natively unfolded in solution but can also bind to membranes in an \u03b1-helical form. It seems likely that these two species exist in equilibrium within the cell, although this is unproven. From in vitro work, it is clear that unfolded monomer can aggregate first into small oligomeric species that can be stabilized by \u03b2-sheet-like interactions and then into higher molecular weight insoluble fibrils. In a cellular context, there is some evidence that the presence of lipids can promote oligomer formation: \u03b1-synuclein can also form annular, pore-like structures that interact with membranes. The deposition of \u03b1-synuclein into pathological structures such as Lewy bodies is probably a late event that occurs in some neurons. On the left hand side are some of the known modifiers of this process. Electrical activity in neurons changes the association of \u03b1-synuclein with vesicles and may also stimulate polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), which has been shown to phosphorylate \u03b1-synuclein at Ser129. Other kinases have also been proposed to be involved.

As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex.

These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed triple helix or \"super helix\", a cooperative quaternary structure stabilized by many hydrogen bonds. With type I collagen and possibly all fibrillar collagens, if not all collagens, each triple-helix associates into a right-handed super-super-coil referred to as the collagen microfibril. Each microfibril is interdigitated with its neighboring microfibrils to a degree that might suggest they are individually unstable, although within collagen fibrils, they are so well ordered as to be crystalline.",

            "document": "Fibrillogenesis . There is no concrete evidence or agreement on the exact mechanisms of Fibrillogenesis, however, multiple hypotheses based on primary research put forth various mechanisms to consider. Collagen fibrillogenesis occurs in the plasma membrane during embryonic development. Interestingly, collagen within the body has a denaturation temperature between 32-40 degrees Celsius, the physiological temperature also falls within this range and thereby poses a significant problem. It is therefore a mystery how collagen survives within the tissues in order to yield itself to the formation of collagen fibrils. A postulated solution to the problem of denaturation based on current research, is that newly formed collagen gets stored in vacuoles. The storage vacuoles also contain molecular aggregates that provide the required thermal stability to allow for fibrillogenesis to occur within the body. In the body, fibrillar collagens have over 50 known binding partners. The cell accounts for the variety of binding partners through the localization of the fibrillogenesis process to the plasma membrane in order to maintain control of which molecules bind to each other and further ensure both fibril diversity and assemblies of certain collagen fibrils in different tissues Kader, Hill, and Canty-Larid published a plausible mechanism for the formation of collagen fibrils. Fibronectin a glycoprotein that binds to receptor proteins known as integrins within the cytoskeleton is a key player in the hypothesized method of fibrillogenesis. The interaction between fibronectin and the integrin receptor causes a conformational change in the fibronectin. Additional receptors bind to fibronectin bringing in Collagen I, procollagen I and collagen V. These molecules interact with fibronectin to promote fibril formation on the surface of the cell.",

The assembly of collagen fibrils, fibrillogenesis appears to be a self-assembly process although there is much speculation about the specifics of the mechanism through which the body produces collagen fibrils. In the body, collagen fibrils are composed of several types of collagen as well as macromolecules. Collagen I is the most abundant structural macromolecule within the vertebrate body and also represents the most abundant collagen found within various collagen fibrils There are immense differences in the types of collagen fibrils that exist within the body. For instance, fibrils within the tendon vary in width and are banded into aggregates that form fibril bundles that resist forces of tension within one dimension. Similarly, fibrils that form the translucent corneal stromal matrix form orthogonal sheets and withstand the force of traction in two dimensions. Remarkably, these two structurally different collagen fibrils are speculated to be formed from the same molecules with Collagen I being the primary collagen found within both structures.",

The amyloid hypothesis is initially compelling because the gene for the amyloid beta precursor APP is located on chromosome 21, and patients with trisomy 21 - better known as Down syndrome - who thus have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit AD-like disorders by 40 years of age. The traditional formulation of the amyloid hypothesis points to the cytotoxicity of mature aggregated amyloid fibrils, which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis and thus inducing apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that higher levels of a variant of the beta amyloid protein known to form fibrils faster \"in vitro\" correlate with earlier onset and greater cognitive impairment in mouse models and with AD diagnosis in humans. However, mechanisms for the induced calcium influx, or proposals for alternative cytotoxic mechanisms, by mature fibrils are not obvious.",

            "document": "Stroma of cornea . Apart from the cells, the major non-aqueous constituents of the stroma are collagen fibrils and proteoglycans. The collagen fibrils are made of a mixture of type I and type V collagens. These molecules are tilted by about 15 degrees to the fibril axis, and because of this, the axial periodicity of the fibrils is reduced to 65\u00a0nm (in tendons, the periodicity is 67\u00a0nm). The diameter of the fibrils is remarkably uniform and varies from species to species. In humans, it is about 31\u00a0nm. Proteoglycans are made of a small protein core to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. The GAG chains are negatively charged. In corneas we can find two different types of proteoglycans: Chondroitin sulphate/dermatan sulphate (CD/DS) and keratan sulphate (KS). In bovine corneas, the length of the CS/DS proteoglycans is about 70\u00a0nm, while the KS proteoglycans are about 40\u00a0nm long. Proteoglycan protein cores attach to the surface of the collagen fibrils with the GAG chains projecting outwards. The GAG chains are able to form antiparallel links with other GAG chains from adjacent fibrils, perhaps through the mediation of positively charged ions. In such a way, bridges are formed between adjacent collagen fibrils. These bridges are subject to thermal motion which prevents them from assuming a fully extended conformation. This results in forces that tend to move adjacent fibrils close to each other. At the same time the charges on the GAG chains attract ions and water molecules by the Donnan effect. The increased water volume between the fibrils results in forces that tend to push the fibrils apart. A balance between attractive and repulsive forces is reached for specific inter-fibrillar distances, which depends on the type of proteoglycans present. Locally, the separations between adjacent collagen fibrils are very uniform.",

Mutations in the genes that encode the proteins Parkin, PINK1, alpha-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) or the protein deglycase DJ-1 have been linked to this disease through research. However, further research is still being considered in order to determine the direct correlations of these genes to Parkinson\u2019s disease. In normal conditions, these genes are believed to be responsible for the cells ability to degrade mitochondria that has been rendered nonfunctional in a process known as mitophagy. However, mutations in the Parkin and pink1 genes have been associated with the cells becoming incapable of degrading faulty mitochondria. The proteins alpha-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and DJ-1 have been shown to promote MAM function interaction between the ER and the mitochondria. The wild-type gene that codes for \u03b1-Syn promotes the physical junction between ER and mitochondria by binding to the lipid raft regions of the MAM. However, the mutant form of this gene has a low affinity to the lipid raft regions, thereby diminishing the contact between the ER and mitochondria and causing accumulation of \u03b1-Syn in Lewy bodies which is a major characteristic of PD. Further research on PD association with alterations in MAM is still being developed.",

If this were all, then the quantity of prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrP and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This can be explained by taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrP concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.",

These age onset degenerative diseases are associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins into insoluble, extracellular aggregates and/or intracellular inclusions including cross-\u03b2 amyloid fibrils. It is not completely clear whether the aggregates are the cause or merely a reflection of the loss of protein homeostasis, the balance between synthesis, folding, aggregation and protein turnover. Recently the European Medicines Agency approved the use of Tafamidis or Vyndaqel (a kinetic stabilizer of tetrameric transthyretin) for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid diseases. This suggests that the process of amyloid fibril formation (and not the fibrils themselves) causes the degeneration of post-mitotic tissue in human amyloid diseases. Misfolding and excessive degradation instead of folding and function leads to a number of proteopathy diseases such as antitrypsin-associated emphysema, cystic fibrosis and the lysosomal storage diseases, where loss of function is the origin of the disorder. While protein replacement therapy has historically been used to correct the latter disorders, an emerging approach is to use pharmaceutical chaperones to fold mutated proteins to render them functional.",
