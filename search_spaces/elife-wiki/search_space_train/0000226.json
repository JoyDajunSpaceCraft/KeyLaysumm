One of the most important types of temporal pattern is circadian rhythmicity\u2014that is, rhythmicity with a period of approximately 24 hours. All animals that have been studied show circadian fluctuations in neural activity, which control circadian alternations in behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental studies dating from the 1990s have shown that circadian rhythms are generated by a \"genetic clock\" consisting of a special set of genes whose expression level rises and falls over the course of the day. Animals as diverse as insects and vertebrates share a similar genetic clock system. The circadian clock is influenced by light but continues to operate even when light levels are held constant and no other external time-of-day cues are available. The clock genes are expressed in many parts of the nervous system as well as many peripheral organs, but in mammals, all of these \"tissue clocks\" are kept in synchrony by signals that emanate from a master timekeeper in a tiny part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.",

While examining transcription of serum albumin gene in the liver, they discovered a DNA Binding Protein (DBP) for the albumin promoter that happened to be rhythmic in its expression. While they initially thought that the underlying mechanism was the rhythmic secretion of hormones, it became clear that the rhythmic expression of DBP was driven instead by cell-autonomous oscillators that are entrained by the master clock in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN). Schibler and his colleagues followed this line of inquiry into the field of chronobiology. A timing system with circadian clocks is closely related to all behaviors in mammals. Schibler is currently doing researches on how biological clock works. Schibler together with his research team in University of Geneva have developed a technique called \"Synthetic Tandem Repeat PROMoter (STAR-PROM) screening\" which can assist identify transcription factors and their functions in peripheral cells so that to figure out how circadian gene expression is governed rhythmically with regulatory mechanisms in cultured cells.",

Most animals and other organisms have \"built in clocks\" in their brains that regulate the timing of biological processes and daily behavior. These \"clocks\" are known as circadian rhythms. They allow maintenance of these processes and behaviors relative to the 24-hour day/night cycle in nature. Although these rhythms are maintained by the individual organisms, their length does vary somewhat individually. Therefore, they must, either continually or repeatedly, be reset to synchronize with nature's cycle. In order to maintain synchronization (\"entrainment\") to 24 hours, external factors must play some role. The reason why entrainment occurs in humans is because each individual's circadian rhythm is longer than 24 hours (majority of population) or shorter than 24 hours (minority of population). Of the various factors that influence this entrainment, light exposure to the eyes is the strongest. Melatonin plays a large role in effects of light on circadian rhythms.

In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria that \"resonate\" with the environmental circadian rhythm. [6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

Lim-1 deficiency results in development of multicystic kidney, whereas, its expression can contribute to pathogenesis of nephroblastomas. Also, Lim-1 plays a role in embryonic retinal development. Lim-1 expression affects differentiation and maintenance of horizontal cells located in the retinal, thus, it could serve as a marker in studies of horizontal cell specification. Lim-1 (Lhx1) functions as a transcription factor necessary for regulating the production of coupling factors required for proper communication between the neurons located in the part of the brain responsible for regulation of circadian rhythms called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In mouse studies where Lim-1 transcription was restricted at some point during development in utero, the individual units within the subject\u2019s molecular clock functioned properly but were unable to work together. Communication of these units is required to match their release of clock proteins which begin a transcription cascade of many other proteins that produce functional responses in tissues. The cyclic pattern of these responses is due to the feedback of the clock proteins and consequent changes to this transcription cascade. Reduced Lim-1 expression leads to inadequate levels of proteins such as Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) that work to produce the neuron coordination required for a regulated circadian rhythm. The lack of such coupling factors causes the circadian clock to not function properly because the units within the SCN cannot match their release of clock proteins, and therefore their transcriptional cascades of proteins that cause changes in arousal do not align.",

In general, external temperature does not influence endothermic animal behavior or circadian rhythm because of the ability of these animals to keep their internal body temperature constant through homeostatic thermoregulation; however, peripheral oscillators (see Circadian rhythm) in mammals are sensitive to temperature pulses and will experience resetting of the circadian clock phase and associated genetic expression, suggesting how peripheral circadian oscillators may be separate entities from one another despite having a master oscillator within the SCN. Furthermore, when individual neurons of the SCN from a mouse were treated with heat pulses, a similar resetting of oscillators was observed, but when an intact SCN was treated with the same heat pulse treatment the SCN was resistant to temperature change by exhibiting an unaltered circadian oscillating phase. In ectothermic animals, particularly the ruin lizard \"Podacris sicula\", temperature has been shown to affect the circadian oscillators within the SCN. This reflects a potential evolutionary relationship among endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates, in how ectotherms rely on environmental temperature to affect their circadian rhythms and behavior and endotherms have an evolved SCN to essentially ignore external temperature and use photoreception as a means for entraining the circadian oscillators within their SCN. In addition, the differences of the SCN between endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates suggest that the neuronal organization of the temperature-resistant SCN in endotherms is responsible for driving thermoregulatory behaviors in those animals differently from those of ectotherms, since they rely on external temperature for engaging in certain behaviors.",

Bright light exposure on awakening to counteract the tendency for circadian rhythms to delay, similar to the treatment for delayed sleep phase disorder, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been found to be effective in some cases, as has melatonin administration in the subjective late afternoon or evening. Light therapy involves at least 20 minutes of exposure to 3000 to 10000 lux light intensity. Going outside on a bright sunny day can accomplish the same benefit as special light fixtures (light boxes). Bright light therapy combined with the use of melatonin as a chronobiotic and avoidance of light before bedtime may be the most effective treatment. Melatonin administration shifts circadian rhythms according to a phase response curve (PRC) that is essentially the inverse of the light PRC. When taken in the late afternoon or evening, it resets the clock earlier; when taken in the morning, it shifts the clock later. Therefore, successful entrainment depends on the appropriate timing of melatonin administration. The accuracy needed for successfully timing the administration of melatonin requires a period of trial and error, as does the dosage. In addition to natural fluctuations within the circadian rhythm, seasonal changes including temperature, hours of daylight, light intensity and diet are likely to affect the efficacy of melatonin and light therapies since these exogenous zeitgebers would compete for hormonal homoeostasis.

Many plant organs contain photo-sensitive compounds (phototropins, cryptochromes and phytochromes), each reacting very specifically to certain wavelengths of light. These light sensors tell the plant if it is day or night, how long the day is, how much light is available and from where the light comes. Shoots grow towards light and roots usually grow away from light. These responses are called phototropism and skototropism respectively. They are brought about by light sensitive pigments like phototropins and phytochromes and the plant hormone auxin. Many plants exhibit certain phenomena at specific times of the day; for example, certain flowers open only in the mornings. Plants keep track of the time of day with a circadian clock. This internal clock is set to solar time every day using sunlight, temperature and other cues, similar to the biological clocks of other organisms. The internal clock coupled with the ability to perceive light also allows plants to measure the time of the day and so find the season of the year. This is how many plants know when to flower. (see photoperiodism) The seeds of many plants sprout only after they are exposed to light. This response is carried out by phytochrome signalling. Plants are also able to sense the quality of light and respond appropriately. For example, in low light conditions, plants produce more photosynthetic pigments. If the light is very bright or if the levels of harmful UV increase, plants produce more of their protective pigments that act as sunscreens.",

This gene is a member of the period family of genes. It is expressed with a daily oscillating circadian rhythm, or an oscillation that cycles with a period of approximately 24 hours. PER1 is most notably expressed in the region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the primary circadian pacemaker in the mammalian brain. PER1 is also expressed throughout mammalian peripheral tissues. Genes in this family encode components of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. Circadian expression of PER1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus will free-run in constant darkness, meaning that the 24-hour period of the cycle will persist without the aid of external light cues. Subsequently, a shift in the light/dark cycle evokes a proportional shift of gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The time of gene expression is sensitive to light, as light during a mammal's subjective night results in a sudden increase in per expression and thus a shift in phase in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Alternative splicing has been observed in this gene; however, these variants have not been fully described. There is some disagreement between experts over the occurrence of polymorphisms with functional significance. Many scientists state that there are no known polymorphisms of the human PER1 gene with significance at a population level that results in measurable behavioral or physiological changes.

In peripheral tissues such as the liver and lung, however, the lack of intercellular coupling does not allow for this compensatory mechanism to occur.

They have demonstrated that a stable ensemble SCN rhythm is orchestrated within an assembly of cellular clocks that are differentially phased and that sit in a distinct topographic order in the SCN. Tetrodotoxin, which blocks action potentials, not only desynchronizes the cell population, but also suppresses the level of clock gene expression, demonstrating that neuronal networks play a dominant role in oscillation of rhythms in the SCN. Using the same Per-luc mice with the optical fiber inserted to the brain, Okamura's team succeeded in monitoring the rhythmic gene expression of the clock gene in real-time in freely moving mice, demonstrating that the Per gene is activated in the daytime and rests in the nighttime in the SCN. Okamura discovered that flashing NMDA, which is analogous to light stimuli, instantly altered the phase of the core clock oscillation of a slice of SCN. This proved that there is rhythmic transcription of genes at the single cell level. It has been shown that the SCN regulates peripheral clocks by regulating melatonin in the sympathetic nervous system. Okamura's team also demonstrated that the light can activate genes and corticosterone secretion in the adrenal gland through the SCN-sympathetic nerve routes.

Most animals and other organisms have \"built in clocks\" in their brains that regulate the timing of biological processes and daily behavior. These \"clocks\" are known as circadian rhythms.

Although these rhythms are maintained by the individual organisms, their length does vary somewhat individually. Therefore, they must, either continually or repeatedly, be reset to synchronize with nature's cycle. In order to maintain synchronization (\"entrainment\") to 24 hours, external factors must play some role. The reason why entrainment occurs in humans is because each individual's circadian rhythm is longer than 24 hours (majority of population) or shorter than 24 hours (minority of population). Of the various factors that influence this entrainment, light exposure to the eyes is the strongest. Melatonin plays a large role in effects of light on circadian rhythms.

In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria that \"resonate\" with the environmental circadian rhythm. [6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

            "document": "Drosophila circadian rhythm . In \"Drosophila\" there are two distinct groups of circadian clocks, namely the clock neurones and the clock genes. They act concertedly to produce the 24-hour cycle of rest and activity. Light is the source of activation of the clocks. The compound eyes, ocelli, and Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets (HB eyelets) are the direct external photoreceptor organs. But the circadian clock can work in constant darkness. Nonetheless, the photoreceptors are required for measuring the day length and detecting moonlight. The compound eyes are important for differentiating long days from constant light, and for the normal masking effects of light, such as inducing activity by light and inhibition by darkness. There are two distinct activity peaks termed the M (for morning) peak, happening at dawn, and E (for evening) peak, at dusk. They monitor the different day lengths in different seasons of the year. The light-sensitive proteins in the eye called, rhodopsins (rhodopsin 1 and 6), are crucial in activating the M and E oscillations. When environmental light is detected, approximately 150 neurones (there are about 100,000 neurones in the \"Drosophila\" brain) in the brain regulate the circadian rhythm. The clock neurones are located in distinct clusters in the central brain. The best-understood clock neurones are the large and small lateral ventral neurons (l-LNvs and s-LNvs) of the optic lobe. These neurones produce pigment dispersing factor (PDF), a neuropeptide that acts as a circadian neuromodulator between different clock neurones. \"Drosophila\" circadian keeps time via daily fluctuations of clock-related proteins which interact in what is called a transcription-translation feedback loop. The core clock mechanism consists of two interdependent feedback loops, namely the PER/TIM loop and the CLK/CYC loop. The CLK/CYC loop occurs during the day in which both Clock protein and cycle protein are produced. CLK/CYC heterodimer act as transcription factors and bind together to initiate the transcription of the \"per\" and \"tim\" genes by binding to a promoter element called E box, around mid-day. DNA is transcribed to produce PER mRNA and TIM mRNA. PER and TIM proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and exhibit a smooth increase in levels over the course of the day. Their RNA levels peak early in the evening and protein levels peak around daybreak. But their proteins levels are maintained at constantly low level until dusk, because during daylight also activates the \"doubletime\" (\"dbt\") gene. DBT protein induces post-translational modifications, that is phosphorylation and turnover of monomeric PER proteins. As PER is translated in the cytoplasm, it is actively phosphorylated by DBT (casein kinase 1\u03b5) and casein kinase 2 (synthesised by \"And\" and \"Tik\") as a prelude to premature degradation. The actual degradation is through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and is carried out by a ubiquitin ligase called Slimb (supernumery limbs). At the same time, TIM is itself phosphorylated by shaggy, whose activity declines after sunset. DBT gradually disappears, and withdrawal of DBT promotes PER molecules to get stabilized by physical association with TIM. Hence, maximum production of PER and TIM occurs at dusk. At the same time, CLK/CYC also directly activates \"vri\" and \"Pdp1\" (the gene for PAR domain protein 1). VRI accumulates first, 3-6 hour earlier, and start to repress \"Clk\"; but the incoming of PDP1 creates a competition by activating \"Clk\". PER/TIM dimer accumulate in the early night and translocate in an orchestrated fashion into the nucleus several hours later, and binds to CLK/CYC dimers. Bound PER completely stops the transcriptional activity of CLK and CYC.",

In \"Clock\" knockout mice, NPAS2 is upregulated to keep the rhythms intact. \"Npas2\"-mutant mice, which do not express functional NPAS2 protein, still maintain robust circadian rhythms in locomotion. However, like CLOCK-deficient mice in the CLOCK/BMAL1 TTFL, \"Npas2\"-mutant mice (in the NPAS2/BMAL1 TTFL) still have small defects in their circadian rhythms such as a shortened circadian period and an altered response to changes in the typical light-dark cycle.

Mice without functional alleles of both \"Clock\" and \"Npas2\" became arrhythmic once placed in constant darkness, suggesting that both genes have overlapping roles in maintaining circadian rhythms.

Bright light exposure on awakening to counteract the tendency for circadian rhythms to delay, similar to the treatment for delayed sleep phase disorder, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been found to be effective in some cases, as has melatonin administration in the subjective late afternoon or evening. Light therapy involves at least 20 minutes of exposure to 3000 to 10000 lux light intensity. Going outside on a bright sunny day can accomplish the same benefit as special light fixtures (light boxes). Bright light therapy combined with the use of melatonin as a chronobiotic and avoidance of light before bedtime may be the most effective treatment. Melatonin administration shifts circadian rhythms according to a phase response curve (PRC) that is essentially the inverse of the light PRC. When taken in the late afternoon or evening, it resets the clock earlier; when taken in the morning, it shifts the clock later. Therefore, successful entrainment depends on the appropriate timing of melatonin administration. The accuracy needed for successfully timing the administration of melatonin requires a period of trial and error, as does the dosage. In addition to natural fluctuations within the circadian rhythm, seasonal changes including temperature, hours of daylight, light intensity and diet are likely to affect the efficacy of melatonin and light therapies since these exogenous zeitgebers would compete for hormonal homoeostasis. Further to this there are unforeseen disruptions to contend with even when a stabilised cycle is achieved; such as travel, exercise, stress, alcohol or even the use of light emitting technology close to a subjective evening/night.",

Although it was known that the brain's circadian clock could influence physiological outputs such as sleep and wakefulness, metabolic rate, and body temperature, Eskin suggested that the circadian clock may play another role as a regulator for memory formation. He and his lab have shown that an aplysia's ability to form long-term memory is dependent on the time of day, namely that aplysia are able to form long-term memories during the day, but are unable to at night. This was done via regulation of several factors, including neurotransmitter release, MAPK signaling, and immediate early gene expression. Short-term memory, however, has not been shown to vary based on time of day. The mechanism by which this occurs is not currently understood, but Eskin and his lab have continued to study the circadian characteristics of glutamate uptake in synaptic plasticity in order to learn more about the mechanism by which memory formation is controlled by a circadian clock. Furthermore, such information will be useful for chronobiology as a whole in helping explain how a biological clock regulates its outputs to produce rhythm.",

American biologist Colin S. Pittendrigh provided an important experiment in 1954, which established that circadian rhythm is driven by a biological clock. The genetics was first understood in 1971, when Seymour Benzer and Ronald J. Konopka reported that mutation in specific genes changes or stops the circadian behaviour. They discovered the mutation called \"period\" (\"per\"). It was the first gene known to control behaviour of any kind. After a decade, Konopka, Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael W.

These zeitgebers do so by alerting individuals to changes in the likelihood of possible or threats in the environment.
