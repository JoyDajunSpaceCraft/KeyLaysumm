            "document": "RAB11FIP5 . Rab11FIP5 is one of the many proteins that have been shown to interact with the Rab11 protein. Rab GTPases, such as Rab11, are enzymes that are involved in vesicular trafficking. Rab11 specifically plays a key role in endocytic trafficking and recycling through guiding early endosomes to endosome recycling complexes. Rab11FIP5, like most other Rab11FIP proteins, interacts with Rab11 by serving as an adaptor protein. This leads to downstream changes with regards to which proteins can interact. This is a result of the various Rab11FIP proteins that each have different binding partners. This process allows for the coordination and organization of endosomal transport and ultimately gives Rab11 its versatile function in the cell. It is believed that Rab11 recruits specific Rab11FIP proteins to the surface of vesicles in order to determine how the vesicle will behave. Studies have shown that Rab11FIP5 localizes to the perinuclear endosomes where it aids in sorting vesicles into the slow recycling route. This process involves the transport of cargo proteins, like endocytosed receptors, to endosome recycling complexes and subsequently to the plasma membrane. This is in contrast to the fast constitutive recycling route which allows for the direct transport of cargo from the endosome to the plasma membrane. Rab11FIP5 aids in this sorting process by binding to kinesin II and forming a protein complex to regulate vesicular trafficking. Some of the proteins that are regulated through Rab11FIP5 mediated vesicle trafficking are microtubule proteins and the TfR receptor. This links Rab11FIP5 functionality to the cell cytoskeleton and the iron uptake of a cell, respectively. Rab11FIP5 has been shown to play a role in the nervous system because it functions in neurons. Studies have suggested that Rab11FIP5 is involved in regulating the localization of the postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptor. The AMPA receptor is an excitatory receptor that can be found on the plasma membranes of neurons. Studies have shown that mice with the Rab11FIP5 gene knocked out have severe long term neuronal depression. Without the presence of Rab11FIP5, it is hypothesized that the internalized AMPA receptors cannot be recycled back onto the plasma membrane because the receptors cannot be correctly trafficked to intracellular organelles responsible for recycling. Rab11FIP5 has also been implicated as a protein involved in the creation of tissue polarity during development. Rab11FIP5 has been shown to be involved in the vesicle trafficking and degradation of proteins used to coordinate embryonic development. This is conducted in a manner that helps maintain the ectoderm polarity in embryonic Drosophila. Rab11FIP5 is also suggested to be involved in aiding salivary epithelial cells to adjust to extracellular pH. V-ATPase, a proton pump protein, has been shown to be reliant on Rab11FIP5 mediated vesicle trafficking. When Rab11FIP5 is knocked down, salivary cells cannot correctly translocate V-ATPase to the plasma membrane in response to extracellular acidosis. While this pathway remains largely unknown, these results suggest a link between Rab11FIP5 function and the maintenance of the buffering capacity of saliva.",

Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.",

Before the discovery of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The proteolytic activities of this system were isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.",

Most proteins that are secretory, membrane-bound, or reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), golgi or endosomes use the co-translational translocation pathway. This process begins with the N-terminal signal peptide of the protein being recognized by a signal recognition particle (SRP) \"while the protein is still being synthesized on the ribosome\". The synthesis pauses while the ribosome-protein complex is transferred to an SRP receptor on the ER in eukaryotes, and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. There, the nascent protein is inserted into the translocon, a membrane-bound protein conducting channel composed of the Sec61 translocation complex in eukaryotes, and the homologous SecYEG complex in prokaryotes. In secretory proteins and type I transmembrane proteins, the signal sequence is immediately cleaved from the nascent polypeptide once it has been translocated into the membrane of the ER (eukaryotes) or plasma membrane (prokaryotes) by signal peptidase. The signal sequence of type II membrane proteins and some polytopic membrane proteins are not cleaved off and therefore are referred to as signal anchor sequences. Within the ER, the protein is first covered by a chaperone protein to protect it from the high concentration of other proteins in the ER, giving it time to fold correctly. Once folded, the protein is modified as needed (for example, by glycosylation), then transported to the Golgi for further processing and goes to its target organelles or is retained in the ER by various ER retention mechanisms.",

For example, in epithelial cells the PAR and Crumbs complexes are localized along the apical membrane and the Scribble complex along the lateral membrane. Together with a group of signaling molecules called Rho GTPases, these polarity complexes can regulate vesicle transport and also control the localization of cytoplasmic proteins primarily by regulating the phosphorylation of phospholipids called phosphoinositides.

Other glycosomes have been found to be attached to myofibrils and mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, sarcolemma, polyribosomes, or the Golgi apparatus.

These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000\u00a0daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other. Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer membrane, which then actively moves them across the membrane. Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes.

These enzymes include monoamine oxidase, rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A ligase.

Once the 2 classes of SNAREs bind to each other, they form a complex that recruits the general elements of the fusion apparatus, namely NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) and SNAPs (soluble NSF-attachment proteins), to the site of membrane fusion, thereby forming the 20S fusion complex. Alpha- and gamma-SNAP are found in a wide range of tissues and act synergistically in intra-Golgi transport. The sequence of the predicted 295-amino acid human protein encoded by NAPA shares 37%, 60%, and 67% identity with the sequences of yeast, Drosophila, and squid alpha-SNAP, respectively. Platelets contain some of the same proteins, including NSF, p115/TAP, alpha-SNAP (this protein), gamma-SNAP, and the t-SNAREs syntaxin-2 and syntaxin-4, that are used in many vesicular transport processes in other cell types. Platelet exocytosis uses a molecular mechanism similar to that used by other secretory cells, such as neurons, although the proteins used by the platelet and their modes of regulation may be quite different.",

This process is catalysed by the protein PDI (protein disulphide isomerase) that resides in the lumen of the ER. Free RTA in the ER lumen then partially unfolds and partially buries into the ER membrane, where it is thought to mimic a misfolded membrane-associated protein. Roles for the ER chaperones GRP94, EDEM and BiP have been proposed prior to the 'dislocation' of RTA from the ER lumen to the cytosol in a manner that utilizes components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. ERAD normally removes misfolded ER proteins to the cytosol for their destruction by cytosolic proteasomes. Dislocation of RTA requires ER membrane-integral E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, but RTA avoids the ubiquitination that usually occurs with ERAD substrates because of its low content of lysine residues, which are the usual attachment sites for ubiquitin. Thus, RTA avoids the usual fate of dislocated proteins (destruction that is mediated by targeting ubiquitinylated proteins to the cytosolic proteasomes). In the mammalian cell cytosol, RTA then undergoes triage by the cytosolic molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 and their co-chaperones, as well as by one subunit (RPT5) of the proteasome itself, that results in its folding to a catalytic conformation, which de-purinates ribosomes, thus halting protein synthesis.",

The obtained SUMO then becomes bound to an E1 enzyme (SUMO Activating Enzyme (SAE)) which is a heterodimer. It is then passed to an E2 which is a conjugating enzyme (Ubc9).

In the case of isopeptides used for conjugating one protein to another for the purpose of signal transduction, the literature is generally dominated by the very well-studied Ubiquitin protein and related proteins. While there are many related proteins to Ubiquitin, such as SUMO, Atg8, Atg12, and so on, they all tend to follow relatively the same protein ligation pathway. Therefore, the best example is to look at Ubiquitin, as while there can be certain differences, Ubiquitin is essentially the model followed in all these cases. The process essentially has three tiers, in the initial step, the activating protein generally denominated as E1 activates the Ubiquitin protein by adenylating it with ATP. Then the adenylated Ubiquitin is essentially activated and can be transferred to a conserved cysteine using a thioester bond which is between the carboxyl group of the c-terminal glycine of the ubiquitin and the sulfur of the E1 cysteine. The activating E1 enzyme then binds with and transfers the Ubiquitin to the next tier, the E2 enzyme which accepts the protein and once again forms a thioester with a conserved bond. The E2 acts to certain degree as an intermediary which then binds to E3 enzyme ligase for the final tier, which leads to the eventual transfer of the ubiquitin or ubiquitin related protein to a lysine site on the targeted protein, or more commonly for ubiquitin, onto ubiquitin itself to form chains of said protein. However, it should be noted that in final tier, there is also a divergence, in that depending on the type of E3 ligase, it may not actually be causing the conjugation. As there are the E3 ligases containing HECT domains, in which they continue this \u2018transfer chain\u2019 by accepting once again the ubiquitin via another conserved cysteine and then targeting it and transferring it to the desired target. Yet in case of RING finger domain containing that use coordination bonds with Zinc ions to stabilize their structures, they act more to direct the reaction. By that its meant that once the RING finger E3 ligase binds with the E2 containing the ubiquitin, it simply acts as a targeting device which directs the E2 to directly ligate the target protein at the lysine site. Though this case ubiquitin does represent other proteins related to it well, each protein obviously will have its own nuisances such as SUMO, which tends to be RING finger domain domainated ligases, where the E3 simply acts as the targeting device to direct the ligation by the E2, and not actually performing the reaction itself such as the Ubiquitin E3-HECT ligases. Thus while the internal mechanisms differ such as how proteins participate in the transfer chain, the general chemical aspects such as using thioesters and specific ligases for targeting remain the same.",

Using a yeast two-hybrid screening system of ORF3 against the porcine cDNA library indicated that the ORF3 protein interacts with the porcine pPirh2, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This E3 ubiquitin ligase normally interacts with p53 during the cell division cycle and prevents it from halting the cell division cycle at S-phase.

NINL is a ninein-like protein that is involved in microtubule organization and has calcium ion binding activity. TRAF2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 2, is part of some E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and is involved in ubiquitinating proteins so they can get degraded by the proteasome. ZBTB16, zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16, is also part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is most likely involved in substrate recognition. There is also an alternate form of CCDC130 where only 803 bases are transcribed instead of 1433 bases, but there is no additional information provided. ZNF165 and ZNF24 are both zinc finger proteins, which bind DNA and other proteins to regulate transcription. Below is a table of the interacting proteins for CCDC130 assembled by GeneCards. The interactions of CCDC130 with NINL, ZNF24, TRAF2, JUP, GATA5 have been verified by a two-hybrid screen according to STRING, so these interactions do occur. JUP is a plaque protein. GATA5 is a transcription factor that helps activate the promoter for lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. Interactions with CDA, DERA, CDC40, NAA25, DGCR14, NAA20, and PRPF19 have not been verified experimentally, but interactions between gene homologs have been documented in other species according to STRING so these interactions could potentially occur.

In a study done at the University of the District of Columbia to characterize CCDC130, they have found that it is induced through insulin signaling, is targeted by three different kinases (GSK3, CK1, and CK2), and is a mitochondrial protein.5 The study also shows that CCDC130 can potentially be used as a biomarker for certain types of cancer due to its differential expression in cancer cells.
