Gamete formation in single-celled haploid organisms such as yeast is called sporulation, resulting in many cellular changes that increase resistance to stress. Gamete formation in multicellular fungi occurs in the gametangia, an organ specialized for such a process, usually by meiosis. When opposite mating types meet, they are induced to leave the vegetative cycle and enter the mating cycle. In yeast, there are two mating types, a and \u03b1. In fungi, there can be two, four, or even up to 10,000 mating types, depending on the species. Mate recognition in the simplest eukaryotes is achieved through pheromone signaling, which induces shmoo formation (a projection of the cell) and begins the process of microtubule organization and migration. Pheromones used in mating type recognition are often peptides, but sometimes trisporic acid or other molecules, recognized by cellular receptors on the opposite cell. Notably, pheromone signaling is absent in higher fungi such as mushrooms.",

Sexual selection has been studied to occur more predominantly in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla. Neurospora crassa is a filamentous, hermaphroditic fungus that is widely studied as a model organism and belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. Once a haploid fungus within N. crassa has attracted or has been attracted to a mate of a different mating type, it will develop either a protoperithecium or conidium to sexually fertilize or both structures to self-fertilize. Protoperithecia formation occurs in environments of low nitrogen. The protoperithecium will act as the female gamete as the recipient of a nucleus while the conidium which will act as the male gamete donating a nucleus. Fertilization occurs once the conidium of a different mating type makes contact with the trichogyne, a structure of the protoperithecium. The two cells from both the protoperithecium and conidium fuse, yet their nuclei remain separate until ascus formation has occurred. The two nuclei then fuse to form a cell containing a diploid nucleus which then undergoes two rounds of meiosis and one mitotic division to ultimately form eight haploid nuclei, four of each mating type.",

The trophozoite is the heterotrophic feeding stage described previously, and the cyst is formed from the fusion of two trophozoites. The cysts are usually round, and between 30\u201334\u00a0mm in diameter. In 1908, N\u00e4gler was working on \"S. diploidea\" and after 2\u20133 weeks in culture he observed 2 equal size trophozoites encyst together in a double wall. N\u00e4gler stated that first the pairs of nuclei in each trophozoite fuse, and then the cells fuse together in the cyst. The amoeba that arises from the cyst is thought to have two haploid nuclei, making it a diploid, thus there is no true haploid life cycle stage. Many other studies have found these bicellular, double walled cysts in both \"S. diploidea\" and \"S. pedata\"; however, the fusion of nuclei has never been documented, as they become very difficult to detect during this process, therefore the exact process of sexual reproduction (including the presence of a haploid stage) are not currently known. The encystation process is likely to be used for sexual reproduction\".\" N\u00e4gler had also stated that when exposed to dry conditions for long periods of time, the trophozoites did not encyst, further supporting the hypothesis that the cysts are used for sexual reproduction, and not as protection from dessication. \"Sappinia\" species also undergo asexual reproduction, as described by N\u00e4gler in 1908. First the two nuclei divide, and two pairs of nuclei are formed in parallel configuration. Then the nuclei cross and become anti-parallel, so that each daughter cell receives half of each of the two nuclei. Cell division then occurs, and binucleate trophozoites are formed. Although the majority of cells are binucleate, many studies have observed cells with one or four nuclei, and some studies have also observed cells with three, six, and eight nuclei. According to Walochnik et al. (2010), N\u00e4gler observed that the rare, mononucleate cells \u201cmostly derived from copulation when one of the copulating amoebae degraded so that the final amoeba was a product of parthenogenesis, the nuclei of one and the same individual fusing, or, but very rarely, derived from cells in which the reduced gametic nuclei of the copulating amoebae fused\u201d. Uninucleate amoebae are found more often in older cultures, with fragmented nucleoli, and usually later degrade. The presence of more than two nuclei is due to nuclear division, without cell division occurring immediately after. In the case of very rare trinucleate cells found by Brown et al. (2007), it is due to incomplete nuclear division. When tetranucleate cells are found, the two pairs are not appressed to each other.",

The results of these experiments led directly to the \"one gene, one enzyme\" hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins. This concept launched molecular biology. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can only be formed when two cells of different mating type come together (see Figure). Like other Ascomycetes, \"N. crassa\" has two mating types that, in this case, are symbolized by \"A\" and \"a\". There is no evident morphological difference between the \"A\" and \"a\" mating type strains. Both can form abundant protoperithecia, the female reproductive structure (see Figure). Protoperithecia are formed most readily in the laboratory when growth occurs on solid (agar) synthetic medium with a relatively low source of nitrogen. Nitrogen starvation appears to be necessary for expression of genes involved in sexual development. The protoperithecium consists of an ascogonium, a coiled multicellular hypha that is enclosed in a knot-like aggregation of hyphae. A branched system of slender hyphae, called the trichogyne, extends from the tip of the ascogonium projecting beyond the sheathing hyphae into the air. The sexual cycle is initiated (i.e. fertilization occurs) when a cell, usually a conidium, of opposite mating type contacts a part of the trichogyne (see Figure). Such contact can be followed by cell fusion leading to one or more nuclei from the fertilizing cell migrating down the trichogyne into the ascogonium. Since both \"A\" and \"a\" strains have the same sexual structures, neither strain can be regarded as exclusively male or female. However, as a recipient, the protoperithecium of both the \"A\" and \"a\" strains can be thought of as the female structure, and the fertilizing conidium can be thought of as the male participant.",

Carotenes are further processed by carotene oxygenase, which is encoded in the tsp3 gene of the \"B. trispora\", to produce TSA. TSA is produced by both of the mating types: (+) and (-) strains, and it is copiously produced especially when compatible mycelia are grown together. As these two different sex types produce TSA, they sense sexually complimentary cells and form gametangia. Eventually, those gametangia merge and zygosporangia form. As these two different mating types meet each other, each mating type transfers the sex-specific precursor of the trisporoid TSA, and acts as a signal for the synthesis of the surface protein agglutinin. Agglutinin allows the two TSAs to recognize each other. It then causes rapid contact and efficient interactions between those two different mating types. Additionally, stimulating both of the mating types by TSA promotes synthesis of \u03b2-carotene. As \u03b2-carotene is produced, it becomes a precursor of trisporoid, which is a pheromone for \"B. trispora\". Production of \u03b2-carotene promotes a positive feedback process that further stimulates carotenogenesis and the production of trisporoid which serves as a \u03b2-carotene increasing substance. Furthermore, it act as a hormone stimulator of its biosynthesis. Thus, \"Blakeslea trispora\" requires certain concentrations of TSA to activate carotenogenesis and produce more carotenoids (about 0.5% of its dry weight) which can be accumulated in the zygospores of \"B. trispora\". Therefore, both TSA and trisporoid acts as sex hormones in \"Blakeslea trispora\", which triggers the sexual reproduction and controls intimate contact between heterothallic strains, further governing the formation of sex structures, zygospores. Carotenoids are absolutely necessary not only for the production of trisporic acid, but also for the process of zygote formation, as significant factors for the production of sporopollenin, a structural component of the zygospore cell wall. It is consequential to regulate this feedback-type synthesis with carotenoids and further synthesis of TSA. Therefore, the formation of the zygospores can be prevented by the inhibition of carotenogenesis in \"Blakeslea trispora\".",

Some fungi have two mating types, termed bipolar, and others including some Red worked on, have thousands of mating types due to a more complicated mating type determination system. These two extreme strategies are thought to be involved with manipulating the chance of out versus self-crossing as evolutionary strategies. He and Cardy studied the events preceding karyogamy, including the transition from monokaryotic to dikaryotic.

His research laid the foundation for the current knowledge body about somatic and sexual compatibility in fungi.

In the absence of light, cercosporin is inactive, but when light is present, the toxin is converted into its excited triplet state. Activated cercosporin reacts with oxygen molecules, generating active single oxygen radicals. Oxygen radicals react with plant cell lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, damaging and killing affected cells, and nutrients released during the cell rupture and death feed the \"Cercospora\" fungus. A study of mutant \"Cercospora\" lacking the gene responsible for cercosporin production demonstrates that, though unnecessary for infection, cercosporin increases the virulence of \"Cercospora\" fungi.",

Typical of ciliates, \"T. thermophila\" differentiates its genome into two functionally distinct types of nuclei, each specifically used during the two different stages of the life cycle. The diploid germline micronucleus is transcriptionally silent and only plays a role during sexual life stages. The germline nucleus contains 5 pairs of chromosomes which encode the heritable information passed down from one sexual generation to the next. During sexual conjugation, haploid micronuclear meiotic products from both parental cells fuse, leading to the creation of a new micro- and macronucleus in progeny cells. Sexual conjugation occurs when cells starved for at least 2hrs in a nutrient-depleted media encounter a cell of complementary mating type. After a brief period of co-stimulation (~1hr), starved cells begin to pair at their anterior ends to form a specialized region of membrane called the conjugation junction. It is at this junctional zone that several hundred fusion pores form, allowing for the mutual exchange of protein, RNA and eventually a meiotic product of their micronucleus. This whole process takes about 12 hours at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, but even longer than this at cooler temperatures. The sequence of events during conjugation is outlined in the accompanying figure.",

The earliest evidence of eukaryotes (complex cells with organelles) dates from 1.85 Ga, and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their metabolism. Later, around 1.7 Ga, multicellular organisms began to appear, with differentiated cells performing specialised functions. Sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of male and female reproductive cells (gametes) to create a zygote in a process called fertilization is, in contrast to asexual reproduction, the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority of macroscopic organisms, including almost all eukaryotes (which includes animals and plants).

Heterothallism is the most common mating system in Basidiomycota and in Agaricomycotina (the mushroom-forming Fungi) about 90% of the species are heterothallic. The tetrapolar type of mating system is ruled by two unlinked mating loci termed \"A\" and \"B\" (in Agaricomycotina) or \"b\" and \"a\" (in Ustilaginomycotina and Pucciniomycotina), both of which can be multiallelic. The combination of \"A\" and \"B\" (or \"b\" and \"a\") alleles, termed mating type, determine the specificity or sexual identity of the individual harboring them. Only individuals with different specificities are compatible with each other and therefore able to start the mating event. A successful mating interaction begins with nuclear exchange and nuclear migration resulting in the formation of dikaryotic hyphae (containing separate haploid nuclei from both initial parents). Dikaryotic hyphae, under the appropriate environmental conditions will give rise to the fruiting body which contains the basidia \u2013 specialized cells in which sexual recombination via karyogamy and meiosis occurs. This dikaryotic condition in Basidiomycota is often maintained by a specialized hyphal structure called a clamp connection. The formation of clamp connections is regulated by both mating loci.  Examples of tetrapolar organisms are the smuts \"Ustilago maydis\" and \"U. longissima\", and the mushrooms \"Coprinopsis cinerea\", \"Schizophyllum commune\", \"Pleurotus djamor\" and \"Laccaria bicolor\". It is believed that multi-allelic systems favor outcrossing in Basidiomycota.

It is marked by the development of many thin hyphae, known as secondary or necrotrophic hyphae, which develop off of the primary hyphae and the infection hypha. Unlike the much larger primary hyphae, these secondary hyphae move freely through the host in all directions, penetrating cell walls and membranes alike. In order to more easily ramify throughout the host tissue, the hyphae release enzymes which break down host-specific proteins. Some such enzymes include cutinase, proteases, pectin and pectate lyases. One enzyme, endopolygalacturonase, is a highly specialized cell wall-degrading enzyme which is critical for the growth of the mycelium. Endopolygalacturonase is normally produced by fruiting plants and induces ripening of fruit by degrading polygalacturonan present in the cell walls. C. lindemuthianum releases large amounts of this enzyme, which not only weakens the cell wall by removing the polygalacturonan, ng the area available for cell-wall degradation by other enzymes.  All of this cell degradation is not allowed to go to waste, however, as the breaking down of the cell wall releases many oligo and monosaccharides which are then free to be taken up by the fungus. This is a much broader availability of sugars than was available in the biotrophic phase, which consisted mostly of glucose and fructose derived from sucrose. Because of how rapidly the fungus is killing the host, it no longer releases any defense response prevention proteins, relying purely on the rapid death of the host and growth of the pathogen. Additionally, since the mycelium must rapidly spread during the necrotrophic stage in order to supply nutrients to the fungus, it will more easily thrive in younger bean plants, which have softer tissues than their older counterparts. While there is very little discoloration of the host cells before secondary hyphae development, discoloration becomes rapidly apparent about 100 hours post infection. Black spots begin to develop on the surface of the plant, and grows radially outward: the manifestation of anthracnose disease. These are the first visual symptoms of an infected plant, and usually occur along leaf veins on the underside of the leaf.

Microsclerotia are masses of hyphae that are produced in the dying part of the plant and are used to infect healthy plants. When a canola root is near the microsclerotia, the fungi will grow towards it. Root exudates cause the microsclerotia to germinate. Once the fungus has entered the root, it will produce hyphae to move through the plant. The fungi also use conidia to transport. Once the fungi reaches the xylem, it can quickly colonize the plant. This causes the plant to start slowly dying. This is due to fungal growth and plant defenses clogging the xylem, so the plant cannot take up nutrients in this area. Once there is enough dead plant tissue, the fungus will produce more microsclerotia. The process will then continue to repeat.

It survives the winter on lesions of previously infected fruit, plant debris, or simply in the soil. This fungus can survive up to a year in the soil. Conidia is released in the spring when the fungus is ready to infect its host, the eggplant. The conidia disperse by air or wind, or by rain-splash, and are able to infect a suitable host this way. Conidia infect an eggplant host by landing on the lower surface young leaves and entering the leaf through stomata or other natural openings of the plant or wounds on the plant. From infection, there appear to be visible lesions on the leaves. The germ tube of the fungus can enter both closed and open stomata. Multiple germ tubes from various conidia can enter the same stomata. This fungus has the best infection rates among young leaves and has a reduced infection rate of mature leaves. It is thought that the reduced infection rate of mature leaves is due to the saprophytic microflora on the leaves and the anti-fungal compounds produced by the mature leaf. This fungus produces secondary conidia within the same season; this furthers the disease cycle and allows the fungus to infect more plants. Mycelium rapidly develops.

The telia and aecia release wind borne resting or hibernating spores (called teliospores and aeciospores) capable of infecting susceptible pear leaves and Juniper respectively. Spores produced from the fungus-induced swellings on juniper stems can be infectious up to 6\u00a0km. The disease causes a yellow-orange spot that turns bright red on leaves of pear trees. The disease can be particularly damaging on pear, resulting in complete defoliation and crop loss if not treated.

The pelotons can range in size and in the loose or tight packaging of their hyphae. Pelotons of live fungal hyphae are eventually disintegrated, or lysed, and become brown or yellow clumps in the orchid cells. The disintegrated pelotons are an area of considerable interest in current research. The disintegrated pelotons first experience a collapse where orchid microtubules surround the pelotons, which may be the mechanism behind the peloton collapse by producing physiological and structural changes of the hyphae. The cortical cells of older roots tend to have more lysed pelotons than young pelotons. Although pelotons are lysed, new pelotons continue to be formed, which indicates a high amount of entering hyphal activity. Pelotons are separated from the orchid's cytoplasm by an interfacial matrix and the orchid's plasma membrane. The material that makes up the interfacial matrix can differ depending on the orchid mychorrizal stage of interaction. Orchid cells with degenerating pelotons lack starch grains, whereas the newly invaded orchid cells contain large starch grains, suggesting the hydrolysis of starch resulting from the fungal colonization.
