In human cells, the best-characterized iron-sensing mechanism is the result of post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA (the chemical instructions derived from DNA genes to make proteins). Sequences of mRNA called iron-responsive elements (IREs) are contained within the mRNA sequences that code for transferrin receptors and for ferritin. Iron-responsive element-binding protein (IRE-BP) binds to these mRNA sequences. On its own, the IRE-BP binds to the IREs of ferritin and transferrin receptor mRNA. But, when iron binds to the IRE-BP, the IRE-BP changes shape with the result that the IRE-BPs can no longer bind the ferritin mRNA. This liberates the mRNA to direct the cell to make more ferritin. In other words, when there is high iron in the cell, the iron itself causes the cell to produce more iron storage molecules. (The IRE-BP is an aconitase; for a schematic drawing of the shape change, see here).",

Frataxin assists iron-sulfur protein synthesis in the electron transport chain to ultimately generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy molecule necessary to carry out metabolic functions in cells. Frataxin also regulates iron transfer in the mitochondria for providing a proper amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to maintain normal processes.

It functions also as the cytoplasmic isoform of aconitase. Aconitases are iron-sulfur proteins that require a 4Fe-4S cluster for their enzymatic activity, in which they catalyze conversion of citrate to isocitrate. This structure was based on x-ray crystal diffraction. The resolution was 2.80 \u00c5. This protein was harvested from the species \"Oryctolagus cuniculus\", or more commonly known as a rabbit. This protein has a couple conformational changes associated with it to explain the alternative functions as either mRNA regulator or as an enzyme.

The core structure for the [FeS] cluster is a cube with alternating Fe and S vertices. These clusters exist in two oxidation states with a small structural change. Two families of [FeS] clusters are known: the ferredoxin (Fd) family and the high-potential iron\u2013suflur protein (HiPIP) family. Both HiPIP and Fd share the same resting state: [FeS], which have the same geometric and spectroscopic features. Differences arise when it comes to their active state: HiPIP forms by oxidation to [FeS], and Fd is formed by reduction to [FeS].",

In the ferrous state, iron acts as an electron donor, while in the ferric state it acts as an acceptor.

The biogenesis of iron sulfur clusters has been studied most extensively in the bacteria \"E. coli\" and \"A. vinelandii\" and yeast \"S. cerevisiae\". At least three different biosynthetic systems have been identified so far, namely nif, suf, and isc systems, which were first identified in bacteria. The nif system is responsible for the clusters in the enzyme nitrogenase. The suf and isc systems are more general. The yeast isc system is the best described. Several proteins constitute the biosynthetic machinery via the isc pathway. The process occurs in two major steps: (1) the Fe/S cluster is assembled on a scaffold protein followed by (2) transfer of the preformed cluster to the recipient proteins. The first step of this process occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic organisms or in the mitochondria of eukaryotic organisms. In the higher organisms the clusters are therefore transported out of the mitochondrion to be incorporated into the extramitochondrial enzymes. These organisms also possess a set of proteins involved in the Fe/S clusters transport and incorporation processes that are not homologous to proteins found in prokaryotic systems.",

In this pool, iron is thought to be bound to low-mass compounds such as peptides, carboxylates and phosphates, although some might be in a free, hydrated form (aqua ions). Alternatively, iron ions might be bound to specialized proteins known as metallochaperones. Specifically, poly-r(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) appear to mediate transfer of free iron to ferritin (for storage) and non-heme iron enzymes (for use in catalysis). The labile iron pool is potentially toxic due to iron's ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Iron from this pool can be taken up by mitochondria via mitoferrin to synthesize Fe-S clusters and heme groups.",
