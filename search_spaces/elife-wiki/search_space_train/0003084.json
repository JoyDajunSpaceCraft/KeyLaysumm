However, more recent analysis suggests that these disparities between specimens may not suggest more than one species, but rather sexual dimorphism within the same species. Two species have been previously classified, \"Pelanomodon moschops\" (\"P. moschops\"), identified by having a skull longer than 18\u00a0cm in length and relatively small cranial bosses and \"Pelanomodon rubidge\"i (\"P. rubidgei\"), identified by having a skull longer than 18\u00a0cm but with relatively large cranial bosses. \"P. moschops\" and \"P. rubidgei\" have been hypothesized to be of the same species by several paleontologists, due to the fact that few structural differences exist between the skulls of the two species. The most prominent distinction between these two skull types is the presence and size of the cranial bosses. \"P. moschops\" lacks the supraorbital ridge and postorbital bosses that are seen in \"P. rubidgei\", and although it maintains the nasal and prefrontal bosses, they are much smaller. Other than these seemingly superficial features, the species share all other cranial features. It is for this reason that it is hypothesized the differences are a result of sexual dimorphism within one species, \"P. moschops\".",

The teeth extended back from the tips of both jaws, and became smaller farther away from the jaw tips (unlike some relatives, where teeth were absent in the upper jaw tip and were relatively uniform in size). The teeth extended farther back into the jaw than in close relatives, as some were present below the front of the \"nasoantorbital fenestra\", the largest opening in the skull. Unlike related species, the skull and jaws were straight, not curved upwards. \"Pterodactylus\", like related pterosaurs, had a crest on its skull composed mainly of soft tissues. In adult \"Pterodactylus\", this crest extended between the back edge of the antorbital fenestra (the largest opening in the skull) and the back of the skull. In at least one specimen, the crest had a short bony base, also seen in related pterosaurs like \"Germanodactylus\". Solid crests have only been found on large, fully adult specimens of \"Pterodactylus\", indicating that this was a display structure that became larger and more well developed as individuals reached maturity. Bennett (2013) noted that other authors claimed that the soft tissue crest of \"Pterodactylus\" extended backward behind the skull; Bennett himself, however, didn't find any evidence for the crest extending past the back of the skull. Two specimens of \"P. antiquus\" (the holotype specimen BSP AS I 739 and the incomplete skull BMMS 7, the largest known skull of \"P. antiquus\") have a low bony crest on their skulls; in BMMS 7 it is 47.5\u00a0mm long (more or less 24% of the estimated total length of its skull) and has a maximum height of 0.9\u00a0mm above the orbit. Several specimens previously referred to \"P. antiquus\" preserved evidence of the soft tissue extensions of these crests, including an \"occipital lappet\", a flexible, tab-like structure extending from the back of the skull. However, most of these specimens have since been reclassified in the related species \"Aerodactylus scolopaciceps\". At least one specimen with these features is still considered to belong to \"Pterodactylus\". This is BSP 1929 I 18, which has an occipital lappet similar to \"Aerodactylus\".

The compound vertebrae of \"Antlerpeton\" distinguish it from lepospondyls and ally it with more primitive stem tetrapods. \"Antlerpeton\" shows characteristics of both early rhachitomous tetrapods and later schizomerous tetrapods. Rhachitomous tetrapods have two types of bones in each vertebral segment: the pleurocentrum and the intercentrum. The intercentrum is the larger of the two bones in rhachitomes, while the pleurocentra are present as two smaller bones in a dorsal position between the intercentra. Schizomerous tetrapods differ from rhachitomes in that their pleurocentra have descended to a more ventral position in the vertebral column. The pleurocentra enlarged in reptiliomorphs to become the main element of the vertebral centrum. While the compound vertebrae of \"Antlerpeton\" are similar to those of classic rhachitomes, the pleurocentra form a distinctive connection with the intercentra in front of and behind them. This pattern is called the anteropleural condition because the paired pleurocentra are associated with the anterior face of the intercentrum behind them. The anteropleural condition is seen in other forms like \"Whatcheeria\", which are generally considered to be advanced rhachitomes. However, it is also seen in lobe-finned fish like \"Lohsania\", suggesting that the feature is not unique to derived early tetrapods.",

            "document": "Catopsbaatar . The skull of \"Catopsbaatar\" was heavy-set, with a wide margin across the front. It was shorter along the midline than at the sides, because the nuchal crest at the back of the head curved inwards at the middle, creating an indention at the hind margin of the skull when viewed from above. The zygomatic arches were strongly expanded to the sides, with the skull width (across the arches) about 85 percent of the skull length. The front of the orbits (eye sockets) were further back than in other djadochtatheriids, resulting in a more elongated snout (65 percent of the skull length) and small orbits. The premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) extended less than two-thirds of the length of the snout in front of the eyes, shorter than that of \"Kryptobaatar\". The premaxilla consisted of parts of the face and the palate; djadochtatheriids had a premaxillary ridge on the boundary between the two (visible when viewing the skull from below). The palatal part of the premaxilla was concave, with many randomly arranged nutrient foramina (openings). The nasal bone\u2014which formed the upper part of the snout\u2014was relatively wide (becoming wider towards the back), and its front was covered with irregularly spaced vascular foramina. The suture between the nasal and frontal bones was less pointed forwards in the middle than were those of \"Catopsbaatar\"'s relatives.  The maxilla (the main part of the upper jaw) was extensive, and formed most of the side of the snout. It contained all the upper teeth, except the incisors. The infraorbital foramina (openings at the lower front of the maxilla) were slit-like in some specimens and rounded in others, and varied in number from one to three. One of the most characteristic features of the face of \"Catopsbaatar\" was the very large anterior zygomatic ridge on the sides of the upper jaw (a site for jaw-muscle attachment). It was much higher than in other djadochtatheriids except for \"Djadochtatherium\", from which it differed in that the ridge was semicircular rather than roughly trapezoidal (other genera have elliptical ridges). The front margin of the anterior zygomatic ridge was thickened, which produced a bulge on the side margin of the snout when viewed from the side and above. The lower part of the suture between the maxilla and the squamosal bone extended along the hind border of the anterior zygomatic ridge. The palatal processes of the maxilla formed most of the palate. The major palatine foramina had shallow grooves extending forward. The postpalatine torus (a bony protrusion on the palate) of \"Catopsbaatar\" was less prominent than was that of \"Tombaatar\". The frontal bone was large, and formed most of the cranial roof. The suture between the frontal and parietal bones formed a U-shaped part in the middle which pointed backwards\u2014similar to the condition in \"Kryptobaatar\" but less deep, with smaller U-shaped structures at the sides. This differed from \"Djadochtatherium\", which had a narrower V-shaped suture between the frontal and parietal bones. The intermediate zygomatic ridge on the squamosal bone (also for jaw-muscle attachment) was much smaller and lower than the anterior zygomatic ridge in front of it. \"Catopsbaatar\" differed from other djadochtatheriids in that the intermediate ridge contacted the anterior ridge with its front edge. The posterior zygomatic ridge at the lower back of the squamosal bone was the weakest of the three ridges, and only marked by a depression. The postorbital processes behind the orbit on the parietal bone were very long, and the parietal ridges extended from the hind margin of the postorbital processes towards each other (but without reaching). The nuchal crest was very prominent, and extended to the sides to form \"wings\". The occipital plate was almost vertical and slightly concave, and was obscured by the nuchal crest when the skull was viewed from above. Though incompletely preserved, it is assumed that the occipital plate sloped back and upwards from the occipital condyles (as in some relatives).

The type and referred specimens of \"Plesiosuchus\" were discovered by John Clavell Mansel-Pleydell in the 1860s alongside the remains of several other large-bodied marine reptiles along the coast of Dorset. Mansel-Pleydell gave these remains to the British Museum (now in the Natural History Museum) in 1866. Part of the holotype of \"P. manselii\" (NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103a) was first described by John Hulke in 1869. He referred it to \"Steneosaurus rostro-minor\" Geoffroy (1825), alongside \"Dakosaurus maximus\" and other specimens. Initially, the skull (NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103) was believed to be pliosaurian; it was the preparator Mr Davies that suggested a crocodylian nature for the skull. In 1870, Hulke described the skull, which is preserved in two sections: the rostrum and the occiput. Hulke suggested that \"this head and the lower jaw both belonged to one individual\" as both the same dimensions and were discovered in close proximity in a reef exposed at low water in Kimmeridge Bay. Some material was destroyed due to pyrite decay while the isolated bone fragment referred to as the \"upper maxilla\" has never been figured and cannot be located. Richard Owen erected the genus \"Plesiosuchus\" for \"S. manselii\" in 1884 as he considered it to be more similar morphologically to extant crocodylians than to \"Steneosaurus\". Woodward (1885) referred the species to the genus \"Dakosaurus\". Lydekker (1888) synonymized \"P. manselii\" with \"Dakosaurus maximus\" while Fraas (1902) regarded the two species to be synonymous or closely related. Phylogenetic analyses of Young & Andrade (2009), Cau & Fanti (2011) and Young \"et al.\" (2011) support the hypothesis that the two are separate species of \"Dakosaurus\". Young \"et al.\" (2012) resurrected the genus name \"Plesiosuchus\" as their phylogenetic analysis found a paraphyletic \"Dakosaurus\" and suggested more basal position for \"P. manselii\" within Geosaurini than previously thought. The holotype of \"Plesiosuchus\" includes, NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103, a broken and incomplete skull with a mandible and isolated postcranial remains (NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103a). The incomplete skull includes the snout and the occiput, lacking the occipital condyle, with fragments of the supratemporal arches and isolated right articular. NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103a includes the right mandibular ramus, some isolated teeth, a humerus, and numerous ribs and vertebrae that are partially or completely imbedded in matrix. Two further specimens may belong to the holotype: NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40104 - an occipital condyle, and NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40105 \u2013 carpal and tarsal bones. Both specimens were donated to the University of Toronto through Professor Ramsay Wright in 1900. From examining the register in the NHMUK Earth Sciences Department, it is possible both specimens were part of NHMUK PV OR40103, although neither specimen could be located at the Royal Ontario Museum. The holotype of \"Plesiosuchus\" represents a large individual. Although it is uncertain whether the holotype (and referred specimens) belong to adults or subadults as none of the vertebrae are well enough preserved to determine the nature of the neurocentral sutures, its total body length is estimated to be . It was collected from the late Kimmeridgian (\"Aulacostephanus autissiodorensis\" Sub-Boreal ammonite Zone) Lower Kimmeridge Clay Formation of Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset. The specimen NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103b, a short series of cervicodorsal vertebrae preserved in matrix, is also a thalattosuchian due to its possession of several apomorphies of the group. However, it does not belong to the same individual as the holotype as the vertebrae are much smaller than those of NHMUK\u00a0PV\u00a0OR40103a, and the matrix is of a different composition. It is unclear whether it belongs to \"Plesiosuchus\" or another metriorhynchid, and therefore it is considered to be Thalattosuchia indeterminate.",

By 1965, this species had been renamed \"Tarbosaurus bataar\". Despite the renaming, many phylogenetic analyses have found \"Tarbosaurus bataar\" to be the sister taxon of \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", and it has often been considered an Asian species of \"Tyrannosaurus\". A recent redescription of the skull of \"Tarbosaurus bataar\" has shown that it was much narrower than that of \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" and that during a bite, the distribution of stress in the skull would have been very different, closer to that of \"Alioramus\", another Asian tyrannosaur. A related cladistic analysis found that \"Alioramus\", not \"Tyrannosaurus\", was the sister taxon of \"Tarbosaurus\", which, if true, would suggest that \"Tarbosaurus\" and \"Tyrannosaurus\" should remain separate. The discovery and description of \"Qianzhousaurus\" would later disprove this and revealed that \"Alioramus\" belonged to the clade Alioramini. The discovery of the tyrannosaurid \"Lythronax\" further indicates that \"Tarbosaurus\" and \"Tyrannosaurus\" are closely related, forming a clade with fellow Asian tyrannosaurid \"Zhuchengtyrannus\", with \"Lythronax\" being their sister taxon. A further study from 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al., also indicates \"Tyrannosaurus\" may have been an immigrant from Asia, as well as a possible descendant of \"Tarbosaurus\". The study further indicates the possibility that \"Tyrannosaurus\" may have driven other tyrannosaurids that were native to North America extinct through competition. Other finds in 2006 indicate giant tyrannosaurs may have been present in North America as early as 75 million years ago.

The prefrontal, nasal, frontal and postfrontal on each side of the skull are fused to each other in large individuals (ie, the bones remain unmelted with their counterpart on the sagittal line). The roof of the skull has a curved anterior conical bone horn, almost equal in height to the rest of the skull in large individuals. Fragments of shells show that the base of the horn occupies the frontal width and the largest of the transverse width of the pachyostotic cream roof. The surface of the horn is decorated with tangential roughnesses and grooves, characteristics which have been identified as osteological correlations of cornified sheaths. 21 The parietal has a very narrow supratemporelle fossa which is separated from its counterpart by a broad flat surface, devoid of a sagittal crest. The quadrate has a dorsal end in the form of a hook, as occurs in other allokotosaurians. The crowns of the Vomerine are more lanceolate than those of the marginal dentition.

The pachycephalosaurs \"Dracorex\" and \"Stygimoloch\" may be specimens of \"Pachycephalosaurus\" in which the dome and horns are not well-developed, either because the animal was a juvenile or a female. This consideration was supported at the 2007 annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Jack Horner of Montana State University presented evidence, from analysis of the skull of the single existing \"Dracorex\" specimen, that this dinosaur may well be a juvenile form of \"Stygimoloch\". In addition, he presented data that indicates that both \"Stygimoloch\" and \"Dracorex\" may be juvenile forms of \"Pachycephalosaurus\". Horner and M.B. Goodwin published their findings in 2009, showing that the spike/node and skull dome bones of all three 'species' exhibit extreme plasticity, and that both \"Dracorex\" and \"Stygimoloch\" are known only from juvenile specimens while \"Pachycephalosaurus\" is known only from adult specimens. These observations, in addition to the fact that all three forms lived in the same time and place, lead them to conclude that \"Dracorex\" and \"Stygimoloch\" were simply juvenile \"Pachycephalosaurus\", which lost spikes and grew domes as they aged. The discovery of baby skulls assigned to \"Pachycephalosaurus\" that were described in 2016 from two different bone beds in the Hell Creek Formation have been presented as further evidence for this hypothesis. The fossils, as described by David Evans and Mark Goodwin \"et al\" are identical to all three supposed genera in the placement of the rugose knobs on their skulls, and thus the unique features of \"Stygimoloch\" and Dracorex are instead morphologically consistent features on a \"Pachycephalosaurus\" growth curve. This and further studies of the different, more mature skulls, \"suggested\" that the knobs present in the skull developed very early in the dinosaur's life while the iconic, domed head developed later. A 2010 study by Nick Longrich and colleagues also supported the hypothesis that all flat-skulled pachycephalosaurs were juveniles, suggesting that flat-skulled forms like \"Goyocephale\" and \"Homalocephale\" represent juveniles of dome-skulled adults.",

An incredibly well-preserved microraptorian nicknamed \"Dave\" (specimen NGMC 91), was first described in a paper published in the journal \"Nature\" by Ji Qiang and colleagues in 2001. They declined to name the specimen because, although the specimen is completely articulated, almost all of the bones shattered when the fossil slabs were split, so that only the silhouettes of these bones are clear in most of the part and counterpart. This obscured diagnostic skeletal features, which made the specimen's genus uncertain. They noted that it was similar in some respects to \"Sinornithosaurus millenii\", and they suggested that the differences between the two could have been due to age. Ji, along with another team of scientists, further emphasized this similarity in a 2002 paper, in which they formally referred the specimen to \"Sinornithosaurus\", though they considered the exact species questionable.

With a very high sample size, the diversity of \"Psittacosaurus\" can be analysed more completely than that of most dinosaur genera, resulting in the recognition of more species.

In addition, most dinosaurs are known solely from bones and can only be evaluated from a morphological standpoint, whereas extant species often have very similar skeletal morphology but differ in other ways which would not normally be preserved in the fossil record, such as behaviour, or colouration. Therefore, actual species diversity may be much higher than currently recognised in this and other dinosaur genera.

The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above, and are usually covered in pits and ridges. The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels, which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood (early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land, and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem). Many temnospondyls also have canal-like grooves in their skulls called sensory sulci. The sulci, which usually run around the nostrils and eye sockets, are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water. As semiaquatic animals, all known temnospondyls have small limbs with no more than four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot.

They estimated the skull to have been long, similar to \"Giganotosaurus\", but perhaps exceeding that of the \"Tyrannosaurus\" \"Sue\", with a 1.53\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) long skull. They also pointed out that carcharodontosaurs appear to have had the proportionally largest skulls, but that \"Tyrannosaurus\" appears to have had longer hind limbs. In a 1995 interview for a \"Science News\" article entitled \"New Beast Usurps \"T. Rex\" as King Carnivore\", Sereno noted that these newly discovered theropods from South America and Africa competed with \"Tyrannosaurus\" as the largest predators, and would help in the understanding of Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas, which had otherwise been very \"North America-centric\". In the same issue of \"Science\" in which \"Carcharodontosaurus\" was described, the Canadian palaeontologist Philip J. Currie cautioned that it was yet to be determined which of the two animals were larger, and that the size of an animal is less interesting to palaeontologists than, for example, adaptations, relationships, and distribution. He also found it remarkable that the two animals were found within a year of each other, and were closely related, in spite of being found on different continents.  In a 1997 \"Science News\" interview, Coria estimated \"Giganotosaurus\" to have been 13.7 (45\u00a0ft) to 14.3 (47\u00a0ft) m long and weighing based on new material, larger than \"Carcharodontosaurus\". Sereno countered that it would be difficult to determine a size range for a species based on few, incomplete specimens, and both palaeontologists agreed that other aspects of these dinosaurs were more important than settling the \"size contest\". In 1998, Jorge O. Calvo and Coria referred a partial left dentary containing some teeth (MUCPv-95) to \"Giganotosaurus\". It had been collected by Calvo near Los Candeleros in 1988 (found in 1987), who described it briefly in 1989, while noting it may have belonged to a new theropod taxon. Calvo and Coria found the dentary to be identical to that of the holotype, though 8% larger at 62\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in).

The examination of specimens of \"T. minor\" with those of \"E. lerichei\" yielded many similarities between the two species, including the foramen aerum as well as other features such as a long nasal process between the premaxillae, dentary alvioli arranged in pairs, and a W-shaped basioccipital tuberosity. \"E. minor\" differs from \"E. lerichei\" on the basis of a noticeably wider nasal and prefrontals positioned anteriorly further up the skull than the lacrimals.",

In the 1970s many specimens of a previously unidentified dinosaur were found associated together in the same bed and locality: a pebbly stratum near a route to Cerro Condor. The specimens were first described by Jose Bonaparte in 1979. For the fossil he erected the genus \"Patagosaurus\", as well as its type species \"P. fariasi\". The generic name of \"Patagosaurus\" comes from the location of its find in Patagonia, and the fact that it is a reptile. The specific name honours Ricardo Farias, on whose land the initial discovery was made. The genus was originally known from an almost complete postcranial skeleton lacking a skull as the holotype, and many referred specimens however in 2003 it was found that a dentary was referable to the species, so more specimens are probably this taxon. Its skeleton was found near those of \"Piatnitzkysaurus\" and \"Volkheimeria\" in the Callovian to Oxfordian aged Patagonian deposits of the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Formation. \"Patagosaurus\" is almost completely known with many articulated specimens found covering almost all of the skeleton, including parts of the skull. Over twelve specimens have been referred to the species, although some of the material is probably from a unique taxon. Bonaparte (1986) assigned three specimens other than the holotype PVL 4170, PVL 4076, MACN CH 934, and MACN CH 933 to the genus. While the holotype includes a post cranial skeleton, the others are known from cranial material and a nearly complete juvenile skeleton and skull. MACN CH 933 is directly comparable with the type material of \"Patagosaurus\", which confirms its association with the genus. A specimen first referred to \"Patagosaurus\" in 2003, MPEF-PV 1670 (which includes just a lower jaw), is also very similar to MACN CH 934, and differences can be associated with age, so therefore, MPEF-PV 1670 presumably represents adult cranial material. However, the teeth of MACN CH 934 are very different from those of both lower jaws (MACN CH 933 and MPEF-PV 1670), so it can be identified as another sauropod from the same deposit as \"Patagosaurus\". Thus, the taxon only certainly includes PVL 4170, MACN CH 933, and MPEF-PV 1670.",

True sturgeons appear in the fossil record during the Upper Cretaceous. In that time, sturgeons have undergone remarkably little morphological change, indicating their evolution has been exceptionally slow and earning them informal status as living fossils. This is explained in part by the long generation interval, tolerance for wide ranges of temperature and salinity, lack of predators due to size and bony plated armor, or scutes, and the abundance of prey items in the benthic environment. Although their evolution has been remarkably slow, they are a highly evolved living fossil, and do not closely resemble their ancestral chondrosteans. They do however still share several primitive characteristics, such as heterocercal tail, reduced squamation, more fin rays than supporting bony elements, and unique jaw suspension. Despite the existence of a fossil record, full classification and phylogeny of the sturgeon species has been difficult to determine, in part due to the high individual and ontogenic variation, including geographical clines in certain features, such as rostrum shape, number of scutes and body length. A further confounding factor is the peculiar ability of sturgeons to produce reproductively viable hybrids, even between species assigned to different genera.

In more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs. The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. Thus, the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).",

They are placed, along with paddlefishes and numerous fossil groups, in the infraclass Chondrostei, which also contains the ancestors of all other bony fishes. The sturgeons themselves are not ancestral to modern bony fishes but are a highly specialized and successful offshoot of ancestral chondrosteans, retaining such ancestral features as a heterocercal tail, fin structure, jaw structure, and spiracle. They have replaced a bony skeleton with one of cartilage, and possess a few large bony plates instead of scales. Sturgeons are highly adapted for preying on bottom animals, which they detect with a row of sensitive barbels on the underside of their snouts. They protrude their very long and flexible \u201clips\u201d to suck up food. Sturgeons are confined to temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Of 25 extant species, only two live in California, the green sturgeon and the white sturgeon (\"A. transmontanus\"). (Moyle 2002)",

The fins of lobe-finned fishes differ from those of all other fish in that each is borne on a fleshy, lobelike, scaly stalk extending from the body. The scales of sarcopterygians are true scaloids, consisting of lamellar bone surrounded by layers of vascular bone, dentine-like cosmine, and external keratin. The morphology of tetrapodomorphs, fish that are similar-looking to tetrapods, give indications of the transition from water to terrestrial life (Clack 2009). Pectoral and pelvic fins have articulations resembling those of tetrapod limbs. These fins evolved into the legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates, amphibians. They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of actinopterygians (ray-finned fish). The braincase of sarcopterygians primitively has a hinge line, but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish. Many early sarcopterygians have a symmetrical tail. All sarcopterygians possess teeth covered with true enamel.",

They are segmented and appear as a series of disks stacked one on top of another.

The batfishes of the Ogcocephalidae family (not to be confused with Batfish of Ephippidae) are also capable of walking along the sea floor. \"Bathypterois grallator\", also known as a \"tripodfish\", stands on three fins on the bottom of the ocean and hunts for food. The African lungfish (P. annectens) can use its fins to \"walk\" along the bottom of its tank in a manner similar to the way amphibians and land vertebrates use their limbs on land. The theory of evolution suggests that life originated in the oceans and later moved onto land, and paleontologists have long been looking for transitional fossils between ocean-living and land-living animals. In 2006, a fossil \"Tiktaalik roseae\" was found which has many features of wrist, elbow, and neck that are beginning to look similar to those of tetrapods.
