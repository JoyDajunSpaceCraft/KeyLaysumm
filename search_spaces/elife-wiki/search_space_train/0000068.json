            "document": "Three prime untranslated region . In molecular genetics, the three prime untranslated region (3'-UTR) is the section of messenger RNA (mRNA) that immediately follows the translation termination codon. An mRNA molecule is transcribed from the DNA sequence and is later translated into protein. Several regions of the mRNA molecule are not translated into protein including the 5' cap, 5' untranslated region, 3' untranslated region, and the poly(A) tail. The 3'-UTR often contains regulatory regions that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. Regulatory regions within the 3'-untranslated region can influence polyadenylation, translation efficiency, localization, and stability of the mRNA. The 3'-UTR contains both binding sites for regulatory proteins as well as microRNAs (miRNAs). By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also has silencer regions which bind to repressor proteins and will inhibit the expression of the mRNA. Many 3'-UTRs also contain AU-rich elements (AREs). Proteins bind AREs to affect the stability or decay rate of transcripts in a localized manner or affect translation initiation. Furthermore, the 3'-UTR contains the sequence AAUAAA that directs addition of several hundred adenine residues called the poly(A) tail to the end of the mRNA transcript. Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds to this tail, contributing to regulation of mRNA translation, stability, and export. For example, poly (A) tail bound PABP interacts with proteins associated with the 5' end of the transcript, causing a circularization of the mRNA that promotes translation. The 3'-UTR can also contain sequences that attract proteins to associate the mRNA with the cytoskeleton, transport it to or from the cell nucleus, or perform other types of localization. In addition to sequences within the 3'-UTR, the physical characteristics of the region, including its length and secondary structure, contribute to translation regulation. These diverse mechanisms of gene regulation ensure that the correct genes are expressed in the correct cells at the appropriate times.",

Ruvkun's research revealed that the miRNA \"lin-4\", a 22 nucleotide regulatory RNA discovered in 1992 by Victor Ambros' lab, regulates its target mRNA \"lin-14\" by forming imperfect RNA duplexes to down-regulate translation. The first indication that the key regulatory element of the \"lin-14\" gene recognized by the \"lin-4\" gene product was in the \"lin-14\" 3\u2019 untranslated region came from the analysis of \"lin-14\" gain-of-function mutations which showed that they are deletions of conserved elements in the \"lin-14\" 3\u2019 untranslated region. Deletion of these elements relieves the normal late stage-specific repression of LIN-14 protein production, and \"lin-4\" is necessary for that repression by the normal \"lin-14\" 3' untranslated region. In a key breakthrough, the Ambros lab discovered that \"lin-4\" encodes a very small RNA product, defining the 22 nucleotide miRNAs. When Ambros and Ruvkun compared the sequence of the \"lin-4\" miRNA and the \"lin-14\" 3\u2019 untranslated region, they discovered that the \"lin-4\" RNA base pairs with conserved bulges and loops to the 3\u2019 untranslated region of the \"lin-14\" target mRNA, and that the \"lin-14\" gain of function mutations delete these \"lin-4\" complementary sites to relieve the normal repression of translation by \"lin-4\". In addition, they showed that the \"lin-14\" 3' untranslated region could confer this \"lin-4\"-dependent translational repression on unrelated mRNAs by creating chimeric mRNAs that were \"lin-4\"-responsive. In 1993, Ruvkun reported in the journal \"Cell (journal)\" on the regulation of \"lin-14\" by \"lin-4\". In the same issue of \"Cell\", Victor Ambros described the regulatory product of \"lin-4\" as a small RNA These papers revealed a new world of RNA regulation at an unprecedented small size scale, and the mechanism of that regulation.

Retrotransposons, such as LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), mobilize via a \u201ccopy and paste\u201d mechanism and are abundant in many eukaryotic species. Several L1 retrotransposons have remained active in mice and humans. L1s contain a small internal promoter within a 5\u2019 untranslated region to drive expression, two open reading frames (ORFs), and a 3\u2019 untranslated region containing sequences for polyadenylation. The two ORFs encode proteins necessary for autonomous retrotransposition; ORF1 encodes an RNA-binding protein while ORF2 encodes a protein containing endonuclease (EN) and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, which nick a site in DNA, then produce a copy via RT. These proteins exhibit an overwhelming specificity for binding to and acting on the transcript that encodes them, enabling near exclusive mobilization of the parental L1 RNA. Using the RT activity of the ORF2 protein, the transcribed L1 RNA is copied into DNA by a process termed target primed reverse transcription (TPRT), and integrated into the genome. Integration occurs with little bias for any particular genomic region, requiring a simple consensus sequence, 5\u2019TTTT\u2019A-3\u2019 (along with minor variations of this sequence).

The term was introduced by Robert Cedergren and colleagues who used a bioinformatic search tool to discover novel ribozymes and RNA motifs originally found in HIV. Ribonomics, like genomics or proteomics, is the large-scale, high-throughput approach to identifying subsets of RNAs by their association with proteins in cells. Since many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are linked with multiple processes, this technique offers a facile mechanism to study the relationship of various intracellular systems. Prokaryotes co-regulate genes common to cellular processes via a polycistronic operon. Since eukaryotic transcription produces mRNA encoding proteins in a monocistronic fashion, many gene products must be concomitantly expressed (see gene expression) and translated in a timed fashion. RBPs are thought to be the molecules which physically and biochemically organize these messages to different cellular locales where they may be translated, degraded or stored. The study of transcripts associated with RBPs is therefore thought to be important in eukaryotes as a mechanism for coordinated gene regulation. The likely biochemical processes which account for this regulation are the expedited/delayed degradation of RNA. In addition to the influence on RNA half-life, translation rates are also thought to be altered by RNA-protein interactions. The Drosphila ELAV family, the Puf family in yeast, and the human La, Ro, and FMR proteins are known examples of RBPs, showing the diverse species and processes with which post-transcriptional gene regulation is associated.",

Pseudogenes are generally functionless as they descend from processed RNAs independent of their evolutionary-context which includes introns and different regulatory elements which enable transcription and processing. These pseudogenes, though non-functional may in some cases still possess promoters, CpG islands, and other features which enable transcription; they thus can still be transcribed and may possess a role in the regulation of gene expression (like SINEs and other non-coding elements).

However, there are studies which suggest that retro-transposable elements such as short-interspersed nuclear elements are not only capable of copying themselves in alternate regions in the genome but are also able to do so for random genes too.

The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA is used as a template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'\u00a0direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.",

The ionizing radiation-induced stress response is very complex and involves many cellular processes. Dr. Chaudry is investigating the involvement of small non-coding micro-RNA in the response of human cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding single-stranded RNAs of ~22 nucleotides that function as negative gene regulators. miRNA negatively regulate their targets either by binding with perfect or nearly perfect complementarity to protein coding mRNA sequences to induce the RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) pathway. Most miRNAs do not cleave their mRNA targets as a mechanism of gene regulation. These miRNAs bind to imperfect complementary sites within the 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of their mRNA targets. In this case the target-gene repression occurs post-transcriptionally at the level of translation resulting in reduced protein levels but the mRNA levels remain unaffected. A single miRNA has the capability to bind to as many as 200 diverse gene targets ranging from transcription factors, secreted factors, receptors and transporters, thus potentially controlling the expression of about one-third of human mRNAs. Research has identified cell type specific modulation of several miRNA in gamma radiation and X-ray-treated human cells. Other studies from our laboratory showed that the expression of many miRNA markedly differ within the same cell line after exposure to either low or high doses of radiation. His work also identified radiation-induced modulation of miRNA in cells with altered DNA repair capability. These studies have provided evidence that miRNA are involved in the response to ionizing radiation exposure in human cells.",

The specific family of SINEs being examined was the Anamnia V-SINEs; this family of short interspersed nuclear elements is often found in the untranslated region of the 3\u2019 end of many genes and is present in vertebrate genomes. The study involved a computational analysis in which the genomic distribution and activity of the Anamnia V-SINEs in Dani rerio zebrafish was examined; furthermore, these V-SINEs potential to generate novel microRNA loci was analyzed. It was found that genes which were predicted to possess V-SINEs were targeted by microRNAs with significantly higher hybridization E-values (relative to other areas in the genome). The genes that had high hybridization E-values were genes particularly involved in metabolic and signaling pathways. Almost all miRNAs identified to have a strong ability to hybridize to putative V-SINE sequence motifs in genes have been identified (in mammals) to have regulatory roles. These results which establish a correlation between short-interspersed nuclear elements and different regulatory microRNAs strongly suggest that V-SINEs have a significant role in attenuating responses to different signals and stimuli related to metabolism, proliferation and differentiation. Many other studies must be undertaken to establish the validity and extent of short-interspersed nuclear element retrotransposons\u2019 role in regulatory gene-expression networks. In conclusion, though not much is known about the role and mechanism by which SINEs generate miRNA gene loci it is generally understood that SINEs have played a significant evolutionary role in the creation of \u201cRNA-genes\u201d, this is also touched upon above in SINEs & Pseudogenes.",

The human genome encodes approximately 25,000 genes but there are significantly more proteins produced. This is accomplished through RNA splicing. The exons of these 25,000 genes can be spliced in many different ways to create countless combinations of RNA transcripts and ultimately countless proteins. Normally, exons from the same pre-mRNA transcript are spliced together. However, occasionally gene products or pre-mRNA transcripts are spliced together so that exons from different transcripts are mixed together in a fusion product known as chimeric RNA.

Genes interact with each other either through their gene products (mRNA, proteins) which can regulate gene transcription, or through small RNA species that can directly regulate genes. These gene-gene interactions, together with genes' interactions with other substances in the cell, form the most basic interaction network: the gene regulatory networks. They perform information processing tasks within the cell, including the assembly and maintenance of other networks. Models of gene regulatory networks include random and probabilistic Boolean networks, asynchronous automata, and network motifs.",

            "document": "Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) . In addition to directly affecting chromatin structure, there are a number of ways in which SINEs can potentially regulate gene expression. For example, long non-coding RNA can directly interact with transcriptional repressors and activators, attenuating or modifying their function. This type of regulation can occur in different ways: the RNA transcript can directly bind to the transcription factor as a co-regulator; also, the RNA can regulate and modify the ability of co-regulators to associate with the transcription factor. For example, Evf-2, a certain long non-coding RNA, has been known to function as a co-activator for certain homeobox transcription factors which are critical to nervous system development and organization. Furthermore, RNA transcripts can interfere with the functionality of the transcriptional complex by interacting or associating with RNA polymerases during the transcription or loading processes. Moreover, non-coding RNAs like SINEs can bind or interact directly with the DNA duplex coding the gene and thus prevent its transcription.  Also, many non-coding RNAs are distributed near protein-coding genes, often in the reverse direction. This is especially true for short-interspersed nuclear elements as seen in Usmanova et al. These non-coding RNAs, which lie adjacent to or overlap gene-sets provide a mechanism by which transcription factors and machinery can be recruited to increase or repress the transcription of local genes. The particular example of SINEs potentially recruit the YY1 polycomb transcriptional repressor is discussed above. Alternatively, it also provides a mechanism by which local gene expression can be curtailed and regulated because the transcriptional complexes can hinder or prevent nearby genes from being transcribed. There is research to suggest that this phenomenon is particularly seen in the gene-regulation of pluripotent cells.",

These units are four types of nucleotides (A,T,G and C) and the sequence of nucleotides stores information in an alphabet called the genetic code. When a gene is read by a cell the DNA sequence is copied into a very similar molecule called RNA (this process is called transcription). Transcription is controlled by other DNA sequences (such as promoters), which show a cell where genes are, and control how often they are copied. The RNA copy made from a gene is then fed through a structure called a ribosome, which translates the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA into the correct sequence of amino acids and joins these amino acids together to make a complete protein chain. The new protein then folds up into its active form. The process of moving information from the language of RNA into the language of amino acids is called translation.",

[11] A-to-I RNA editing is catalyzed by a family of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) that specifically recognize adenosines within double-stranded regions of pre-mRNAs and deaminate them to inosine. Inosines are recognised as guanosine by the cells translational machinery. There are three members of the ADAR family ADARs 1-3, with ADAR1 and ADAR2 being the only enzymatically active members. ADAR3 is thought to have a regulatory role in the brain. ADAR1 and ADAR2 are widely expressed in tissues, while ADAR3 is restricted to the brain. The double-stranded regions of RNA are formed by base-pairing between residues in the close to region of the editing site, with residues usually in a neighboring intron, but can be an exonic sequence. The region that base pairs with the editing region is known as an Editing Complementary Sequence (ECS). ADARs bind interact directly with the dsRNA substrate via their double-stranded RNA binding domains. If an editing site occurs within a coding sequence, it can result in a codon change. This can lead to translation of a protein isoform due to a change in its primary protein structure. Therefore, editing can also alter protein function. A-to-I editing occurs in a non coding RNA sequences such as introns, untranslated regions (UTRs), LINEs, SINEs (especially Alu repeats). The function of A to I editing in these regions is thought to involve creation of splice sites and retention of RNAs in the nucleus amongst others.",
