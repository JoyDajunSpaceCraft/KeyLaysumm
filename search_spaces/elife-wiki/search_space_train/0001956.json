The model predicted the effect of altered circadian timing upon particular phenotypes in clock-mutant plants.

Phosphorus is a key molecular component of genetic reproduction. When phosphorus is present in inadequate levels, genetic processes such as cell division and plant growth are impaired. Hence, phosphorus deficient plants may mature at a slower rate than plants with adequate amounts of phosphorus. The stunted growth induced by phosphorus deficiency has been correlated with smaller leaf sizes and a lessened number of leaves. Phosphorus deficiency may also create an imbalance in the storage of carbohydrates. Photosynthesis, the main function of plant cells that produces energy from sunlight and water, usually remains at a normal rate under a phosphorus-deficient state. However phosphorus usage in functions within the cell usually slow. This imbalance of rates in phosphorus deficient plants leads to the buildup of excess carbohydrate within the plant.

Kinetic energy is the energy of an object as a result of its motion. The significance of ATP is in its ability to store potential energy within the phosphate bonds. The energy stored between these bonds can then be transferred to do work. For example, the transfer of energy from ATP to the protein myosin causes a conformational change when connecting to actin during muscle contraction. It takes multiple reactions between myosin and actin to effectively produce one muscle contraction, and, therefore, the availability of large amounts of ATP is required to produce each muscle contraction. For this reason, biological processes have evolved to produce efficient ways to replenishment the potential energy of ATP from ADP.  Breaking one of ATP\u2019s phosphorus bonds generates approximately 30.5 kilojoules per Mole of ATP (7.3 kcal).

At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This resulted in hydrogen representing a store of potential energy which can be released by nuclear fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) snow-avalanches, or when water evaporates from oceans and is deposited high above sea level (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena on Earth. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by green plants as \"chemical potential energy\", when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen.

In Edinburgh in the pre-genomics era, he collaborated with Chris Leaver and cloned several key enzymes of plant metabolism, including malate synthase, isocitrate lyase and PEP carboxykinase. He conceived an idea with Anthony Trewavas of creating transgenic plants expressing the calcium-sensitive luminous jellyfish protein, aequorin, to report calcium signalling in plants. Together they obtained funding, created the plants and showed that they could report rapid calcium signalling in response to cold, fungi, touch and wind. This work predated similar research using green fluorescent protein from the same jellyfish. In 1996 Smith and his PhD student Takeshi Takaha reported the discovery of cyclic glucans containing up to 200 glucose residues, which they named cycloamylose. Cycloamylose and related cycloglucans are now used extensively in food and biotechnology industries. Further research on starch metabolism with Alison Smith and Sam Zeeman at the John Innes Centre led to the discovery of a novel pathway of starch breakdown in leaves. Smith was also instrumental in defining pathways of energy metabolism involving peroxisomes, particularly fatty acid beta-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle.",

The gelatinization temperature of starch depends upon plant type and the amount of water present, pH, types and concentration of salt, sugar, fat and protein in the recipe, as well as starch derivatisation technology are used. Some types of unmodified native starches start swelling at 55 \u00b0C, other types at 85 \u00b0C. The gelatinization temperature of modified starch depends on, for example, the degree of cross-linking, acid treatment, or acetylation. Gel temperature can also be modified by genetic manipulation of starch synthase genes. Gelatinization temperature also depends on the amount of damaged starch granules; these will swell faster. Damaged starch can be produced, for example, during the wheat milling process, or when drying the starch cake in a starch plant. There is an inverse correlation between gelatinization temperature and glycemic index. High amylose starches require more energy to break up bonds to gelatinize into starch molecules.",

            "document": "Dextrin . Dextrins can be produced from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion in the human body and during malting and mashing, or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process, contributing to flavor, color and crispness. Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. The starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions, and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with \u03b1-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard Reaction.",
