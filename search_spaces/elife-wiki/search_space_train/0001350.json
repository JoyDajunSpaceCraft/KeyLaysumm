            "document": "Cold hardening . Plants in temperate and polar regions adapt to winter and sub zero temperatures by relocating nutrients from leaves and shoots to storage organs. Freezing temperatures induce dehydrative stress on plants, as water absorption in the root and water transport in the plant decreases. Water in and between cells in the plant freezes and expands, causing tissue damage. Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate cellular injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures. Non-acclimatized individuals can survive \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C, while a acclimatized individual in the same species can survive \u221230\u00b0. Plants that originated in the tropics, like tomato or maize, don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures. The plant starts the adaptation by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the signal to activate or repress expression of appropriate genes. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the stress, caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living cells. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature stress are shared with other abiotic stresses, like drought or salinity.When temperature drops, the membrane fluidity, RNA and DNA stability, and enzyme activity change. These, in turn, affect transcription, translation, intermediate metabolism, and photosynthesis, leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on \"arabidopsis\" show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the absolute temperature. The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of calcium influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. Calcium channels in the cell membrane detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in \"alfalfa\" and \"arabidopsis\". The response to the change in calcium elevation depends on the cell type and stress history. Shoot tissue will respond more than a root cells, and a cell that already is adapted to cold stress will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn't control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of reactive oxygen species and excitation of photosystem 2, which influences low-temp signal transduction mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation.",

Most samples of plants are commonly collected in the spring time for molecular determination of ApMV using ELISA. This is vital because concentration of ApMV is highly varied from season to season. ApMV is known to be a labile virus because its concentrations are negatively affected by high temperatures. In a study completed by Svoboda and Pol\u00e1k, they observed five symptomless apple trees infected with ApMV. These five symptomless trees were selected from a pool of 472 apple trees that were inoculated with ApMV in two different orchards. Samples of various plant tissue from young leaves, flower petal, dormant buds, and phloem were taken at different time of the vegetation period. In this study, ELISA was used to detect ApMV in the different samples from the five apple trees. The relative concentrations of the virus in the leaves and flower were highest in the earlier spring months such as March and April. This suggests that the virus propagates better when it is under colder weather conditions . Furthermore, during cooler months, the virus's relative concentration is highest in the leaf and flower, rather than the phloem and dormant bud. Once May and June occur, the relative concentrations of the disease severely decreases. This was evident by Svoboda and Pol\u00e1k's study because as the temperature rose from spring to summer, the ELISA test detected lower relative concentrations of ApMV. As a result of this heat sensitivity, symptoms of ApMV tend to be masked in the summer months versus the spring months.",

Plants perform best when grown in well-drained soil in a location that receives full sun. Different varieties prefer different soil types, ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay, but all prefer fertile ground with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. For optimal growth, there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in the soil, especially during the early head formation stage, and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves. Temperatures between prompt the best growth, and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting (flowering). Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures (a process called vernalization) only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period. The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about . Vernalization allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering. In certain climates, cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower, a practice that was common in the eastern US. Plants are generally started in protected locations early in the growing season before being transplanted outside, although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested. Seedlings typically emerge in about 4\u20136 days from seeds planted deep at a soil temperature between . Growers normally place plants apart. Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant (especially the amount of light) and increases the time taken to reach maturity. Some varieties of cabbage have been developed for ornamental use; these are generally called \"flowering cabbage\". They do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white, red, or pink. Early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity, while late varieties take about 120 days. Cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to the touch. They are harvested by cutting the stalk just below the bottom leaves with a blade. The outer leaves are trimmed, and any diseased, damaged, or necrotic leaves are removed. Delays in harvest can result in the head splitting as a result of expansion of the inner leaves and continued stem growth. Factors that contribute to reduced head weight include: growth in the compacted soils that result from no-till farming practices, drought, waterlogging, insect and disease incidence, and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds.",

In the history of agriculture, farmers observed a traditional distinction between \"winter cereals\", whose seeds require chilling (to trigger their subsequent emergence and growth), and \"spring cereals\", whose seeds can be sown in spring, and germinate, and then flower soon thereafter. Scientists in the early 19th century had discussed how some plants needed cold temperatures to flower. In 1857 an American agriculturist John Hancock Klippart, Secretary of the Ohio Board of Agriculture, reported the importance and effect of winter temperature on the germination of wheat. One of the most significant works was by a German plant physiologist Gustav Gassner who made a detailed discussion in his 1918 paper. Gassner was the first to systematically differentiate the specific requirements of winter plants from those of summer plants, and also that early swollen germinating seeds of winter cereals are sensitive to cold. In 1928 a Russian geneticist Trofim Lysenko published his works on the effects of cold on cereal seeds, and coined the term \"\u044f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\" (\"jarovization\") to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals (\"Jarovoe\" in Russian, originally from \"jar\" meaning fire or the god of spring). Lysenko himself translated the term into \"vernalization\" (from the Latin \"vernum\" meaning Spring). After Lysenko the term was used to explain the ability of flowering in some plants after a period of chilling due to physiological changes and external factors. The formal definition was given in 1960 by a French botanist P. Chouard, as \"the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a chilling treatment\".",

These light sensors tell the plant if it is day or night, how long the day is, how much light is available and from where the light comes. Shoots grow towards light and roots usually grow away from light. These responses are called phototropism and skototropism respectively. They are brought about by light sensitive pigments like phototropins and phytochromes and the plant hormone auxin. Many plants exhibit certain phenomena at specific times of the day; for example, certain flowers open only in the mornings. Plants keep track of the time of day with a circadian clock. This internal clock is set to solar time every day using sunlight, temperature and other cues, similar to the biological clocks of other organisms. The internal clock coupled with the ability to perceive light also allows plants to measure the time of the day and so find the season of the year. This is how many plants know when to flower.

As an invasive species, \"B.\u00a0elongata\" has spread north up to Norway, southwest into parts of France and Italy, and has even been introduced in large areas of Southern Africa, Southern Australia, and Southwest America. \"B.\u00a0elongata\" was first collected in the United States at Linnton, Oregon by Wilhelm Suksdorf in 1911. The collection occurred near a surrounding ballast where ships were often unloaded but its specific subspecies of \"B.\u00a0elongata\" was unknown. The next recording had occurred in Bingen, Washington in 1915. Thereafter in 1968, with no apparent evidence of the species spreading, \"Brassica elongata\" subsp. \"integrifolia\" was discovered by John Thomas Howell, an American botanist, while driving on the roadsides of US Highway 50 in the east-central regions of Nevada. Since then \"B.\u00a0elongata\" has become an identifiable common sight of the regional flora of the desert regions of Eureka and White Pine counties. \"Brassica elongata\" is a perennial plant. Its habitat is often located in semi-arid to arid climates in regions located in Europe, central Asia, North America, Africa, and Australia. The plant undergoes its flowering during June through July in the Northern Hemisphere.

Further, \"Bombus lapidarius\" is important in pollinating many other species, including \"Centaurea scabiosa\". A study found that though \"Apis mellifera\" was also involved in pollination of this species, \"B. lapidarius\" greatly outnumbers \"Apis\" and other bee species in number and importance in pollination.

It has been suggested that these differences in ability developed evolutionarily as different types of bees developed specific roles within the colony. How long a bee stays at a particular flower seems to be connected to behavior, as it appeared the bees assumed low pollen reward, despite increased pollen levels in experiments. However, the amount of pollen transferred in a visit from \"B. lapidarius\" was only affected by the amount of pollen in the flower that individual was at. Further, it appeared that variation in duration of visits to different flowers was related to differences in foraging speed, not differences in how well the bee was able to remove nectar.  Bees will typically forage in patches, but show no clear directionality in their foraging. Further, pollinating bees will usually visit the nearest neighboring plants, thus gene flow between plants tends to be pretty limited.  Other experiments also indicated that body size is an important factor in how bumblebees pollinate. It would appear that size affects how often the bee will visit flowers as well as how well the bee could pollinate. Smaller bees seem to pollinate more effectively than larger bees.

The tolerance for extreme body temperatures in a given eurythermic organism is largely due to an increased temperature tolerance by the respective organism's homologous proteins. In particular, the proteins of a warm-adapted species may be inherently more eurythermal than a cold-adapted species, with warm-adapted species' proteins withstanding higher temperatures before beginning to denature, therefore avoiding possible cell death. Eurythermal species also have shown adaptations in protein synthesis rates compared to non-eurythermal similar species.

Generally the more hours of darkness each day, the shorter the overall flowering period but the lower the yield. Conversely, the fewer hours of darkness each day, the longer the overall flowering period and the higher the yield. Traditionally, most growers change their plants lighting cycle to 12 hours on and 12 hours off since this works as a happy medium to which most strains respond well. This change in photoperiod mimics the plant's natural outdoor cycle, with up to 18 hours of light per day in the summer and down to less than 12 hours of light in fall and winter. Some 'semi-autoflowering' strains that have been bred exclusively for outdoor use, particularly in outdoor climates such as that of the UK, will start flowering with as much as 16\u201317 hours of light per day. Usually they can start flowering in July and finish far earlier than other strains, particularly those that haven't been bred as outdoor strains. Semi-autoflowering strains can be harvested before the weather in northern latitudes becomes very wet and cold (generally October), whereas other strains are just finishing flowering, and may suffer from botrytis (grey mold) caused by wet weather. Alternatively growers may artificially induce the flowering period during the warmer months by blacking out the plants for 12 hours a day i.e. by covering the plants with black plastic for example, which excludes all light during this period so the plant can flower even during long days.",

Temperatures between prompt the best growth, and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting (flowering). Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures (a process called vernalization) only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period. The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about . Vernalization allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering. In certain climates, cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower, a practice that was common in the eastern US.

In the history of agriculture, farmers observed a traditional distinction between \"winter cereals\", whose seeds require chilling (to trigger their subsequent emergence and growth), and \"spring cereals\", whose seeds can be sown in spring, and germinate, and then flower soon thereafter. Scientists in the early 19th century had discussed how some plants needed cold temperatures to flower. In 1857 an American agriculturist John Hancock Klippart, Secretary of the Ohio Board of Agriculture, reported the importance and effect of winter temperature on the germination of wheat. One of the most significant works was by a German plant physiologist Gustav Gassner who made a detailed discussion in his 1918 paper. Gassner was the first to systematically differentiate the specific requirements of winter plants from those of summer plants, and also that early swollen germinating seeds of winter cereals are sensitive to cold. In 1928 a Russian geneticist Trofim Lysenko published his works on the effects of cold on cereal seeds, and coined the term \"\u044f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\" (\"jarovization\") to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals (\"Jarovoe\" in Russian, originally from \"jar\" meaning fire or the god of spring). Lysenko himself translated the term into \"vernalization\" (from the Latin \"vernum\" meaning Spring). After Lysenko the term was used to explain the ability of flowering in some plants after a period of chilling due to physiological changes and external factors. The formal definition was given in 1960 by a French botanist P. Chouard, as \"the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a chilling treatment\".",

The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes. Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.",

Freezing temperatures induce dehydrative stress on plants, as water absorption in the root and water transport in the plant decreases. Water in and between cells in the plant freezes and expands, causing tissue damage. Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate cellular injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures. Non-acclimatized individuals can survive \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C, while a acclimatized individual in the same species can survive \u221230\u00b0. Plants that originated in the tropics, like tomato or maize, don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures. The plant starts the adaptation by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the signal to activate or repress expression of appropriate genes. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the stress, caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living cells. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature stress are shared with other abiotic stresses, like drought or salinity.When temperature drops, the membrane fluidity, RNA and DNA stability, and enzyme activity change. These, in turn, affect transcription, translation, intermediate metabolism, and photosynthesis, leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on \"arabidopsis\" show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the absolute temperature. The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of calcium influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. Calcium channels in the cell membrane detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in \"alfalfa\" and \"arabidopsis\". The response to the change in calcium elevation depends on the cell type and stress history. Shoot tissue will respond more than a root cells, and a cell that already is adapted to cold stress will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn't control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of reactive oxygen species and excitation of photosystem 2, which influences low-temp signal transduction mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation.",

This is in direct contrast to plants that typically inhabit more tropical or montane regions, where plants may have purely tolerable range between only about 10\u00b0 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, such as the banyan tree. The tolerance for extreme body temperatures in a given eurythermic organism is largely due to an increased temperature tolerance by the respective organism's homologous proteins. In particular, the proteins of a warm-adapted species may be inherently more eurythermal than a cold-adapted species, with warm-adapted species' proteins withstanding higher temperatures before beginning to denature, therefore avoiding possible cell death. Eurythermal species also have shown adaptations in protein synthesis rates compared to non-eurythermal similar species.

Rudimentary comprehensions set precedent for later molecular evaluation and, eventually, a more complete view of how plants operate.  Modern epigenetic work depends heavily on bioinformatics to gather large quantities of data relating the function of elements such as intensive looks at DNA sequences or patterns in DNA modifications.

Forms of histone methylation cause repression of certain genes that are stably inherited through mitosis but that can also be erased during meiosis or with the progression of time. The induction of flowering by exposure to low winter temperatures in Arabidopsis thaliana shows this effect. Histone methylation participates in repression of expression of an inhibitor of flowering during cold. In annual, semelparous species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, this histone methylation is stably inherited through mitosis after return from cold to warm temperatures giving the plant the opportunity to flower continuously during spring and summer until it senesces. However, in perennial, iteroparous relatives the histone modification rapidly disappears when temperatures rise, allowing expression of the floral inhibitor to increase and limiting flowering to a short interval. Epigenetic histone modifications control a key adaptive trait in Arabidopsis thaliana, and their pattern changes rapidly during evolution associated with reproductive strategy. Another study tested several epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana - lines with similar genomes but varying levels of DNA methylation - for their drought sensitivity and their sensitivity to nutritional stress. It was found that there was a significant amount of heritable variation in the lines in regards to traits important for survival of drought and nutrient stress. This study proved that variation in DNA methylation can result in heritable variation of ecologically important plant traits, such as root allocation, drought tolerance, and nutrient plasticity.
