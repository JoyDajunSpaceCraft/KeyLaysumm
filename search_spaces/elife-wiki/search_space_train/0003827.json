Whary, \"et al.\" examined Helicobacter rodentium infection and the resulting ulcerative typhlocolitis, sepsis, and morbidity. Using ASF mice, they showed a decrease in disease progression due to colonization resistance in the lower bowel from the impacts of normal anaerobic flora. In another summary, Fox examined the relationship between microbiome of the gut and the onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with the infection of \"H. bilis. H. bilis\" is noted to elicit heterologous immune response to lower gut flora, in both activating pro-inflammatory cytokine and dendritic cell activity and probiotic anti-inflammatory activity due to the presentation of commensal antigens. ASF Lactobacilli and Bacteroides help moderate bowel inflammation in a balanced manner in pathogen infection studies. Beyond the study of bacterial pathogen, microflora community, intestinal immune system interactions and diseases, ASF has been used in experiments examining the transmission of retrovirus. In the paper by Kane, \"et al.\", they found the mouse mammary tumor virus is transmitted most efficiently through bacteria colonized mucosal surfaces. The retrovirus evolved to rely on the interaction with microbiota and toll-like receptor to evade immune pathways. ASF is not a comprehensive representation of the over 400 diverse bacteria species that normally occupy the mice GI tract. Even in SPF mice, there are many Helicobacter and Filamentous species not included in ASF1. Not to mention the many bacteria that could not be cultured under laboratory settings due to inadequate environment and symbiosis needs.

There is some indication of relationships between milk microbiota and other human milk components, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), maternal cells, and nutrient profiles. Specific bacterial genera have been shown to be associated with variation in levels of milk macronutrients such as lactose, proteins, and fats. HMOs selectively facilitate growth of particular beneficial bacteria, notably \"Bifidobacterium\" species. Furthermore, as bifidobacterial genomes are uniquely equipped to metabolize HMOs, which are otherwise indigestible by enzymes of the infant gut, some have suggested a coevolutionary dynamic between HMOs and certain bacteria common in both the milk and infant gastrointestinal microbiomes. Furthermore, relative to other mammalian milks, primate milk, particularly human milk, appears to be unique with respect to the complexity and diversity of its oligosaccharide repertoire. Human milk is typified by greater overall HMO diversity and predominance of oligosaccharides known to promote growth of \"Bifidobacterium\" in the infant gut. Milk microbiota are thought to play an essential role in programming the infant immune system, and tend to reduce the risk of adverse infant health outcomes. Differences in milk oligosaccharides between humans and non-human primates could be indicative of variation in pathogen exposure associated with increased sociality and group sizes. Together, these observations may indicate that milk microbial communities have coevolved with their human host, supported by the expectation that microbes which promote host health facilitate their own transmission and proliferation.",

Gut flora can also regulate the production of antibodies by the immune system. One function of this regulation is to cause B cells to class switch to IgA. In most cases B cells need activation from T helper cells to induce class switching; however, in another pathway, gut flora cause NF-kB signaling by intestinal epithelial cells which results in further signaling molecules being secreted. These signaling molecules interact with B cells to induce class switching to IgA. IgA is an important type of antibody that is used in mucosal environments like the gut. It has been shown that IgA can help diversify the gut community and helps in getting rid of bacteria that cause inflammatory responses.

In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria that \"resonate\" with the environmental circadian rhythm. [6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

One such study, which collected 16 years of behavioral data on wild baboons, highlights the effects that sociality has on infant survival. A positive relationship is established between infant survival to one year and a composite sociality index, a measure of sociality based on proximity and social grooming. Evidence has also been provided for the effect of sociality on adult survival in wild baboons. Direct correlations between measures of social connectedness (which focuses on social grooming) and median survival time for both female and male baboons were modeled.  Social bonds established by grooming may provide an adaptive advantage in the form of conflict resolution and protection from aggression. In wild savannah baboons, social affiliations are shown to augment fitness by increasing tolerance from more dominant group members and increasing the chance of obtaining aid from conspecifics during instances of within-group contest interactions. In the yellow baboon, adult females form relationships with their kin, who offer support during times of violent conflict within social groups. In Barbary macaques\",\" social grooming results in the formation of crucial relationships among partners.

HMOs selectively facilitate growth of particular beneficial bacteria, notably \"Bifidobacterium\" species. Furthermore, as bifidobacterial genomes are uniquely equipped to metabolize HMOs, which are otherwise indigestible by enzymes of the infant gut, some have suggested a coevolutionary dynamic between HMOs and certain bacteria common in both the milk and infant gastrointestinal microbiomes. Furthermore, relative to other mammalian milks, primate milk, particularly human milk, appears to be unique with respect to the complexity and diversity of its oligosaccharide repertoire. Human milk is typified by greater overall HMO diversity and predominance of oligosaccharides known to promote growth of \"Bifidobacterium\" in the infant gut. Milk microbiota are thought to play an essential role in programming the infant immune system, and tend to reduce the risk of adverse infant health outcomes. Differences in milk oligosaccharides between humans and non-human primates could be indicative of variation in pathogen exposure associated with increased sociality and group sizes.

A systematic review of 15 human randomized controlled trials from July 2016 found that certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria from the \"Bifidobacterium\" and \"Lactobacillus\" genera (\"B. longum\", \"B. breve\", \"B. infantis\", \"L. helveticus\", \"L. rhamnosus\", \"L. plantarum\", and \"L. casei\"), when taken by mouth in daily doses of 10\u201310\u00a0colony forming units (CFU) for 1\u20132\u00a0months, possess treatment efficacy (i.e., improves behavioral outcomes) in certain central nervous system disorders\u00a0\u2013 including anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder, and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder\u00a0\u2013 and improves certain aspects of memory. However, changes in the composition of gut microbiota has also been found to be correlated with harmful effects on health. In an article published by Musso et al., it was found that the gut microbiota of obese invidividuals had more Firmicutes and less Bacteroidetes than healthy individuals. Furthermore, a study done by Gordon et al., confirmed that it was the composition of the microbiota that causes obesity rather than the other way around. This was done by transplanting the gut microbiota from diet-induced obese(DIO) mice or lean control mice into lean germ-free mice that do not have a microbiome. They found that the mice transplanted with DIO mouse gut microbiota had significantly higher total body fat than the mice transplanted with lean mouse microbiota when fed with the same diet.",

Lozupone earned a Bachelor of Science from Villanova University in 1997 and went on to obtain a master's degree from Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado in 1999. She went on to complete her doctoral work at the University of Colorado Boulder studying under Rob Knight, who is the founder of the American Gut Project. Little was known about the overall microbiome, the group of organisms sharing in the human body space, of the gut and the symbiotic relationship between host and bacteria, as most prior work had been done on fecal matter.  Her thesis delineated the UniFrac algorithm which has allowed researchers to plot the relationships between microbial communities in the human gut, how they interact, and how they might be related to specific diseases. Lozupone's work, detailed in a 2012 paper which appeared in \"Nature\" entitled \"Diversity, Stability and Resilience of the Human Gut Microbiota\", was noted for its attempt to analyze what is the \"normal\" bacterial state in the human gut. By approaching the gut as an ecosystem, scientists are then able to factor in the effects of lifestyle, diet, health status which might change the bacterial makeup present in the gastrointestinal tract.",

            "document": "Bacterial circadian rhythm . In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria that \"resonate\" with the environmental circadian rhythm. [6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

In particular, grooming in yellow baboons (\"Papio cynocephalus\") has been studied extensively, with numerous studies showing an increase in fitness as a result of social bonds formed through social grooming behavior. One such study, which collected 16 years of behavioral data on wild baboons, highlights the effects that sociality has on infant survival. A positive relationship is established between infant survival to one year and a composite sociality index, a measure of sociality based on proximity and social grooming. Evidence has also been provided for the effect of sociality on adult survival in wild baboons. Direct correlations between measures of social connectedness (which focuses on social grooming) and median survival time for both female and male baboons were modeled.  Social bonds established by grooming may provide an adaptive advantage in the form of conflict resolution and protection from aggression. In wild savannah baboons, social affiliations are shown to augment fitness by increasing tolerance from more dominant group members and increasing the chance of obtaining aid from conspecifics during instances of within-group contest interactions. In the yellow baboon, adult females form relationships with their kin, who offer support during times of violent conflict within social groups. In Barbary macaques\",\" social grooming results in the formation of crucial relationships among partners. These social relationships serve to aid cooperation and facilitate protection against combative groups composed of other males, which can oftentimes cause physical harm. Furthermore, social relationships have also been proven to decrease risk of infanticide in several primates.",

From around 2005 on, the scientific community has thoroughly developed the concept of human microbiome and begun the systematic study to establish the relationship between the microbiome and human physiology in health and disease. We begin to understand that gut microbiota helps modulating host immunity at a systemic level. However, gut microbiome does not affect skin immunity significantly, instead, skin immunity is modulated by skin microflora according to the results obtained by Naik et al. Analyzing immunologic changes of germ-free (GF) mice with reconstituted gut microbiota showed a recovery of Il-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels up to those observed in the gastrointestinal tract of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice but gut microbiome restoration did not affect skin immunity. Comparing GF and SPF mice showed a decrease in the skin production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A. To evaluate the functional consequences of the absence of skin microbiota Leishmania major was introduced intradermally and the lesions were evaluated. L. major lesions in GF mice were significantly smaller and less severe than in SPF mice, however, the number of parasites after infection was significantly higher in GF mice. These results cearly indicate that GF mice have an impaired capacity of response in front of infections compared to SPF mice. Finally, mono-association of GF mice with \"S. epidermidis\" clearly restored immunity function which in the case of skin is mediated by IL-1 which is key for the restoration of IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Thus skin commensals exert their effect by enhancing IL-1 signaling and amplifying responses according to local inflammatory milieu. As IL-1 has been implicated in the etiology and pathology of psoriasis and other cutaneous disorders, it is likely that skin commensals are important drivers and amplifiers of skin pathologies.",

It is omnivorous, eating carrion, fungi, animal feces, algae, lichen, and vegetation (living or decaying). These slugs prefer to eat on cloudy days or at night when temperatures are above 10 degrees Celsius. Mucus-production necessitates moist habitats, such as among leaf-litter, mosses, or fallen trees. Consequently, the black slug becomes most active after rainfall. A 1976 study compared black slug assimilation rates to that of similar slugs in the UK. The study determined the black slug feeds at similar rates to other European slugs (in terms of biomass), suggesting the black slug is an equally important decomposer/consumer in forest systems. The study theorized these high assimilation rates might result from abundant enzymes in slug digestive systems: amylase, invertase, cellulase, xylanase, and chitinase. The last might be especially indicative of how these slugs can consume large quantities of fungi such as \"Armillaria mellea\". Microbiota within black slug digestive systems produce these enzymes\u2014such as the bacteria that produce cellulose\u2014enabling the slugs to break down lignocellulose. A recent study further explored \"Arion ater\"\u2019s gut microbiome and discovered the black slug to have far more bacteria within its gut than did neighboring, northern European insects, including members of the orders \"Coleoptera, Isoptera, Orthoptera\", and \"Diptera\". This study learned the black slug\u2019s gut microbiome to be functional at a wide range of temperatures and pH levels, and its results suggest that the mycobacterial culture may be uniform throughout the black slug\u2019s gut and that \"Gammaproteobacteria\" composes most of this culture. This study contrasted its results to studies of North American black slugs that presented higher levels of cellulolytic activity at a narrower pH range. In summary, \"Arion ater\" can digest diverse food material such as cellulose because gut bacteria produce digestive enzymes.",
