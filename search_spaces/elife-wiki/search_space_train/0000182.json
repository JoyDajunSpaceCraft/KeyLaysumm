The other type, haloperoxidases, takes bromine from seawater along with hydrogen peroxide and converts them into organobromine compounds. These unique vanadium complexes, as well as others are found in some terrestrial beings such as mushrooms. Additionally, these compounds may provide very useful for humans as they have been found to help people with diabetes by improving glucose control. The Pecoraro group has taken these interesting applications of vanadium and started research to more fully understand them. In particular, the haloperoxidases have been a main focus on research. First, the group synthesized vanadium complexes to mock the vanadium haloperoxidases in order to gain an understanding of the mechanism. Not only did their system efficiently catalyze the reaction, but they were also able to collect valuable kinetic data and come up with a proposed catalytic cycle as seen below. The information showed that an acid/base was necessary for catalysis to occur. With this information in hand, efforts are underway to understand how these complexes are activated naturally to allow halide oxidation. Also, they are working to understand the structures of the inactive forms of these vanadium based haloperoxidases.

His research at NCI centered on working out how the body metabolizes environmental carcinogens, such as one of the most common in our environment, benzopyrene, which occurs in tobacco smoke, auto exhaust, and other smoke-producing sources. His laboratory identified the genes for the many cytochrome P-450 enzymes that detoxify various environmental carcinogens. These enzymes break down hazardous chemicals into molecules that can be safely excreted by the kidney. He developed the foundation for a genetic profile that could screen individuals for susceptibility to certain carcinogens, foods, and drugs. Gelboin pioneered early research on how chemicals, drugs, and carcinogens are metabolized by enzymes in small lipid vesicles (microsomes) in the liver. He demonstrated that microsomal enzymes convert certain carcinogens to a form that tightly bound to DNA, and he then showed that those enzymes were of the cytochrome P-450 class. That finding revealed how pro-carcinogens can be converted in the body to substances that damage DNA and that can lead to mutations or cancer. He developed monoclonal antibodies to the cytochrome P-450 enzymes and, not only used them for research in his laboratory, but distributed them worldwide to allow other laboratories and pharmaceutical companies to use them in their development of new drugs. His work served as the foundation for the concept of in vitro activation of procarcinogens to substances that damage DNA, which was the basis for a widely used test of chemicals for their cancer-producing potential (the Ames test). His laboratory was the first to introduce high-performance liquid chromatography to the study of metabolism (chemical conversions in the body) of certain hazardous chemicals to which people may be exposed.His work had a huge impact on the fields of chemical carcinogenesis, drug and carcinogen metabolism, and on studies of the cytochrome P-450 drug and carcinogen metabolizing enzymes.  During his career at NIH, Gelboin received numerous awards, including four NIH Merit awards, a technology transfer award, an honorary D.Sc. degree, a Nakasone Lecture Award and a Claude Bernard Award. He presented many keynote lectures, organized research conferences, participated in the work of several committees that evaluated research proposals, and edited several books on chemical carcinogenesis. One of his publications, a paper on development of a widely used assay for a key enzyme in the metabolism of carcinogens, became an Institute for Scientific Exchange Citation Classic. He held eight patents related to his research.

            "document": "Microbial drug delivery . Microbial drug delivery is an emerging form of drug administration characterized by the use of commensal microbes that have been genetically modified to produce medications for chronic diseases in humans. Only proteinaceous drugs can be produced by microbes, as DNA encodes for protein. Research into microbial drug delivery refers to this route of administration as topical, since the microbes release the drug directly to the surface of affected tissues, namely the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium. Microbial drug delivery is not currently used as a standard route of drug administration due to its experimental nature. During clinical trials, it has been used to treat forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The most prominently studied vehicles of microbial drug administration are the bacterial species, \"Lactococcus lactis\" and \"Bacteroides ovatus.\"",

Microbes are important in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model organisms and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases and as such are the target of hygiene measures. Most microorganisms can reproduce rapidly, and bacteria are also able to freely exchange genes through conjugation, transformation and transduction, even between widely divergent species.",

Originally working in cooperation with Dr. David Stahl, Rittmann introduced the powerful tools of molecular biology to environmental engineering, helping create the exciting field known today as Environmental Biotechnology, in which the goal is to manage microbial communities so that they provide services to society. The tools of molecular microbial ecology directly interrogate the genetic information in microorganisms. They make it possible to determine what types of microorganisms are present in the complex communities of environmental biotechnologies, what reactions those microorganisms can carry out, what reactions they are carrying out, and how they interact with each other and their environment. Now working hand-in-glove with Center colleague Dr. Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown, Rittmann is using molecular microbial ecology to understand and manage microbial communities in a wide range of microbiological processes used for removing pollution from water, generating renewable resources, and improving human health.",

Lozupone earned a Bachelor of Science from Villanova University in 1997 and went on to obtain a master's degree from Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado in 1999. She went on to complete her doctoral work at the University of Colorado Boulder studying under Rob Knight, who is the founder of the American Gut Project. Little was known about the overall microbiome, the group of organisms sharing in the human body space, of the gut and the symbiotic relationship between host and bacteria, as most prior work had been done on fecal matter.  Her thesis delineated the UniFrac algorithm which has allowed researchers to plot the relationships between microbial communities in the human gut, how they interact, and how they might be related to specific diseases. Lozupone's work, detailed in a 2012 paper which appeared in \"Nature\" entitled \"Diversity, Stability and Resilience of the Human Gut Microbiota\", was noted for its attempt to analyze what is the \"normal\" bacterial state in the human gut. By approaching the gut as an ecosystem, scientists are then able to factor in the effects of lifestyle, diet, health status which might change the bacterial makeup present in the gastrointestinal tract.",

The history of probiotics can be traced to the first use of cheese and fermented products, that were well known to the Greeks and Romans who recommended their consumption. The fermentation of dairy foods represents one of the oldest techniques for food preservation. The original modern hypothesis of the positive role played by certain bacteria was first introduced by Russian scientist and Nobel laureate \u00c9lie Metchnikoff, who in 1907 suggested that it would be possible to modify the gut flora and to replace harmful microbes with useful microbes. Metchnikoff, at that time a professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, proposed the hypothesis that the aging process results from the activity of putrefactive (proteolytic) microbes producing toxic substances in the large bowel. Proteolytic bacteria such as clostridia, which are part of the normal gut flora, produce toxic substances including phenols, indols, and ammonia from the digestion of proteins. According to Metchnikoff, these compounds were responsible for what he called \"intestinal autointoxication\", which would cause the physical changes associated with old age.",
