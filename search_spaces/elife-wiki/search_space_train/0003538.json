This enzyme is required for the complete reaction of at least five different multi-enzyme complexes. Additionally, DLD is a flavoenzyme oxidoreductase that contains a reactive disulfide bridge and a FAD cofactor that are directly involved in catalysis. The enzyme associates into tightly bound homodimers required for its enzymatic activity. The protein encoded by the DLD gene comes together with another protein to form a dimer in the central metabolic pathway. Several amino acids within the catalytic pocket have been identified as important to DLD function, including R281 and N473. Although the overall fold of the human enzyme is similar to that of yeast, the human structure is different in that it has two loops that extend from the general protein structure and into the FAD binding sites. When bound the NAD+ molecule, required for catalysis, is not close to the FAD moiety. However, when NADH is bound instead, it is stacked directly op top of the FAD central structure. The current hE3 structures show directly that the disease-causing mutations occur at three locations in the human enzyme: the dimer interface, the active site, and the FAD and NAD(+)-binding sites.",

Kinetic experiments reveal rates of how fast intermediate steps in catalysis occur and the most extensive set of studies on Kinesin-5 kinetics has been on the human protein. X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and real-time infrared spectroscopy have been used to measure the structure of Kinesin-5 in the different catalytic intermediate states. Changes in the secondary structure, or conformational switching, is required to convert and amplify biochemical changes in the catalytic active site into larger movements necessary for cellular motion. For example, the first step of ATP hydrolysis, which is the attack of the terminal phosphate of ATP by a water molecule, had not been observed by x-ray crystallography in any kinesin protein, until recently in Kinesin-5. This crystal structure showed that there was not one, but rather two, water molecules and they are in close association with each other. A two-water catalytic model was proposed and confirmed by an alternate method to track Kinesin-5 catalysis in real-time and in a kinesin protein in a different subfamily.

One method that may be used to try and combat this immunologic response in dogs with food allergies is the use of hydrolyzed proteins in the diet. Whole proteins are composed of single amino acids organized into a chain, which then interact in order to fold the protein into its final three-dimensional structure. Hydrolyzed proteins are whole proteins that have been broken down into smaller polypeptides through a process called protein hydrolysis. One method of protein hydrolysis involves the use of enzymes specific to proteins called proteases. Proteases act by cleaving or cutting whole proteins at specific amino acids within their structure in order to form multiple small polypeptides from a single whole protein. Different proteases are specific to different amino acids, and as such multiple proteases may be used in order to cut a protein at several different locations. The theory behind the use of these small peptides in food as an alternative to whole proteins is that their small size will prevent them from stimulating the immune system of the gut, thereby reducing and/or preventing an allergic reaction. When hydrolyzed proteins are used in hypoallergenic canine diets it is with the hopes of avoiding an immunologic reaction both in dogs that have consumed the whole protein previously and in dogs whose intestinal tract has never seen the whole protein before but has been known to react to other protein types.",

This work was carried out as a response to realizing that water molecules are visible in the electron density maps produced by X-ray crystallography. The water molecules are interacting with the protein and tend to cluster at the protein's polar regions. This led to the idea of immersing the purified protein crystal in other solvents (e.g. ethanol, isopropanol, etc.) to determine where these molecules cluster on the protein. The solvents can be chosen based on what they approximate, that is, what molecule this protein may interact with (e.g. ethanol can probe for interactions with the amino acid serine, isopropanol a probe for threonine, etc.). It is vital that the protein crystal maintains its tertiary structure in each solvent. This process is repeated for multiple solvents and then this data can be used to try to determine potential active sites on the protein.

The enzyme is categorised as an endoglucanase, which internally cleaves \u03b2-1,4 -glycosydic bonds in cellulose chains facilitating further degradation of the polymer. Different species in the same family as T. Maritima make cellulases with different structures. Cellulases produced by the species Coprinopsis Cinerea consists of seven protein strands in the shape of an enclosed tunnel called a beta/alpha barrel. These enzymes hydrolyse the substrate carboxymethyl cellulose. Binding of the substrate in the active site induces a change in conformation which allows degradation of the molecule.",

A deficiency in this enzyme results in the build-up of non-hydrolyzed mucopolysaccharides in the patient. This disease can be extremely debilitating for the patient or can result in hydrops fetalis prior to birth. In addition, mental retardation, short stature, coarse facial features, spinal abnormalities, and enlargement of liver and spleen are observed in surviving patients. This disease has been modeled in a strain of mice as well as a family of dogs. More recently researchers have discovered a feline family that exhibits deficiencies in \u03b2-glucuronidase activity. The source of this reduction of activity has been identified as an E351K mutation (Glu351 is mutated to a lysine residue). Glu351 is conserved in mammalian species, which suggests an important function for this residue. Examination of the human X-ray crystal structure suggests that this residue (Glu352 in the human enzyme), which is buried deep within the TIM barrel domain, may be important for stabilization of the tertiary structure of the enzyme. In the crystal structure, it appears that Arg216, a member of the jelly roll domain of the protein, forms a salt bridge with Glu352; therefore, Glu352 is likely involved in stabilizing the interaction between two different three-dimensional domains of the enzyme.",

The first of these reactions takes place when the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 hydrolyses ATP and forms a high-energy thioester linkage between a cysteine residue in its active site and the C-terminus of ubiquitin. The resulting activated ubiquitin is then passed to E2, which is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Another group of enzymes, more specifically ubiquitin protein ligases called E3, bind to the misfolded protein. Next they align the protein and E2, thus facilitating the attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues of the misfolded protein. Following successive addition of ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues of the previously attached ubiquitin, a polyubiquitin chain is formed. A polyubiquitinated protein is produced and this is recognized by specific subunits in the 19S capping complexes of the 26S proteasome. Hereafter, the polypeptide chain is fed into the central chamber of the 20S core region that contains the proteolytically active sites. Ubiquitin is cleaved before terminal digestion by deubiquitinating enzymes. This third step is very closely associated with the second one, since ubiquitination takes place during the translocation event. However, the proteasomal degradation takes place in the cytoplasm.",

This work was carried out as a response to realizing that water molecules are visible in the electron density maps produced by X-ray crystallography. The water molecules are interacting with the protein and tend to cluster at the protein's polar regions. This led to the idea of immersing the purified protein crystal in other solvents (e.g. ethanol, isopropanol, etc.) to determine where these molecules cluster on the protein. The solvents can be chosen based on what they approximate, that is, what molecule this protein may interact with (e.g. ethanol can probe for interactions with the amino acid serine, isopropanol a probe for threonine, etc.). It is vital that the protein crystal maintains its tertiary structure in each solvent. This process is repeated for multiple solvents and then this data can be used to try to determine potential active sites on the protein.

While some protein crystals have been observed in nature, protein crystallization is predominantly used for scientific or industrial purposes, most notably for study by X-ray crystallography. Like many other types of molecules, proteins can be prompted to form crystals when the solution in which they are dissolved becomes supersaturated. Under these conditions, individual protein molecules can pack in a repeating array, held together by noncovalent interactions. These crystals can then be used in structural biology to study the molecular structure of the protein, or for various industrial or biotechnological purposes.",

By developing a new mathematics algorithm to untangle the superimposed images obtained from the cryo-EM, he managed to reconstruct the 3D structure of ion channel at 17 \u00c5 resolution. This is the first one 3D structure of the ion channel. It was greeted with great excitement. Soon afterwards, the same way was applied to reconstruct the 3D structure of Ca-ATPase with the cooperation from David Stokes. They published their analysis of the structure of this protein in Nature in 1993. After backing to Japan, Toyoshima's later research continued to focus on the structure of Ca-ATPase. Through combining the x-ray crystallography and the crystallization method for EM, Toyoshima obtained large enough crystals of Ca-ATPase in the first state, the E1\u00b72Ca. Then he published it in 2000, which caused a lot of excitement at that time because it was world-first for the crystal structure of P-type ATPases at such a high revolution(2.6 \u00c5). Over the years that followed, he published a series of crystal structure of Ca-ATPase in succession. Until now, he has determined crystal structures of this ATPase in ten different states by x-ray crystallography, covering roughly the entire reaction cycle. He also extended his research to Na, K-ATPase and developed a methodology for electron crystallography of ultrathin 3D protein crystals. Nowadays, he still aims at the calcium ion pump just as the direction of the footprints which he stepped on this road of adventure in the past 27 years.",

Electron cryo-tomography studies have confirmed the approximately icosahedral geometry of the carboxysome, and have imaged protein molecules inside (presumed to be RuBisCO), arranged in a few concentric layers. The non-icosahedral faceted shapes of some carboxysomes can naturally be explained within the elastic theory of heterogeneous thin shells. The carboxysome has an outer shell composed of a few thousand protein subunits, which encapsulates a CO-producing enzyme (carbonic anhydrase) and a carbon-fixing enzyme (RuBisCO). Proteins known to form the shell have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The protein that constitutes the majority of the shell forms a cyclical hexamer and belongs to BMC protein family. These hexamers, BMC-H proteins, are the basic building blocks of the shell. In some crystal forms the hexamers assemble further in a side-by-side fashion to form a tightly packed molecular layer, which presumably is how the facets of the shell are assembled. Small pores perforate many different types of BMC-H hexamers, and may serve as the route for diffusion of small substrates (e.g. bicarbonate) into and out of the carboxysome. Positively charged amino acids in the pores presumably help promote the diffusion of the negatively charged substrates and products. Other minor structural components of the shell that have been characterized include pentameric proteins (BMC-P proteins), which have been proposed to occupy the vertices of the icosahedral shell. A third building block of the carboxysome shell is a protein composed of two BMC domains in tandem (BMC-T proteins). Structurally, many of these are known to form trimers which are pseudohexameric. Some members of the BMC-T protein family stack in a face-to-face fashion and form tiny cages. Based on crystal structures, these protein cages have relatively large gated pores on both sides, and it has been proposed that the opening and closing of the pore could be controlled in a manner similar to an air-lock. Such an air-lock, in contrast to BMC-H proteins with constitutively open pores, has been suggested to serve as a route for larger substrates (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) and products (3-phosphoglycerate) that must cross the shell.",

It is a metallo-oxo cluster comprising four manganese ions (in oxidation states ranging from +2 to +4) and one divalent calcium ion. When it oxidizes water, producing oxygen gas and protons, it sequentially delivers the four electrons from water to a tyrosine (D1-Y161) sidechain and then to P680 itself. The first structural model of the oxygen-evolving complex are solved by X-ray crystallography from frozen protein crystals with a resolution of 3.8\u00c5 in 2001. Over the next years the resolution of the model is gradually increased to 2.9\u00c5 . While obtaining these structures, in itself was a great feat, they do not show the oxygen-evolving complex in full detail. In 2011 the OEC of PSII was resolved to a level of 1.9\u00c5 revealing five oxygen atoms serving as oxo bridges linking the five metal atoms and four water molecules bound to the Mn4CaO5 cluster; more than 1,300 water molecules were found in each photosystem II monomer, some forming extensive hydrogen-bonding networks that may serve as channels for protons, water or oxygen molecules. At this stage, it is suggested that the structures obtained by X-ray crystallography are biased, since there is evidence that the manganese atoms are reduced by the high-intensity X-rays used, altering the observed OEC structure. This incentivized researchers to take their crystals to a different X-ray facilities, called X-ray Free Electron Lasers, such as SLAC in the USA. In 2014 the structure observed in 2011 was confirmed. Knowing the structure of Photosystem II did not suffice to reveal how it works exactly. So now the race has started to solve the structure of Photosystem II at different stages in the mechanistic cycle (discussed below). Currently structures of the S1 state and the S3 state's have been published almost simultaneously from two different groups, showing the addition of an oxygen molecule designated O6 between Mn1 and Mn4, suggesting that this may be the site on the oxygen evolving complex, where oxygen is produced.",

Their backbones are characterized by amide linkages formed by the polymerization between amino and carboxylic acid groups attached to the alpha carbon of each of the twenty amino acids. These amino acid sequences are translated from cellular mRNAs by ribosomes in the cytoplasm of the cell. The ribosomes have enzymatic activity which directs the condensation reaction forming the amide linkage between each successive amino acid. This happens during a biological process known as translation. In this enzymatic mechanism a covalently bonded tRNA shuttle acts as the leaving group for the condensation reaction. The newly liberated tRNA can \"pick up\" another peptide and continuously participate in this reaction. The sequence of the amino acids in the polypeptide backbone is known as the primary structure of the protein. This primary structure leads to folding of the protein into the secondary structure, formed by hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygens and amine hydrogens in the backbone. Further interactions between residues of the individual amino acids form the protein's tertiary structure. For this reason, the primary structure of the amino acids in the polypeptide backbone is the map of the final structure of a protein, and it therefore indicates its biological function.",

Much of the innovation within NMR spectroscopy has been within the field of protein NMR spectroscopy, an important technique in structural biology. A common goal of these investigations is to obtain high resolution 3-dimensional structures of the protein, similar to what can be achieved by X-ray crystallography. In contrast to X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy is usually limited to proteins smaller than 35 kDa, although larger structures have been solved. NMR spectroscopy is often the only way to obtain high resolution information on partially or wholly intrinsically unstructured proteins. It is now a common tool for the determination of Conformation Activity Relationships where the structure before and after interaction with, for example, a drug candidate is compared to its known biochemical activity. Proteins are orders of magnitude larger than the small organic molecules discussed earlier in this article, but the basic NMR techniques and some NMR theory also applies. Because of the much higher number of atoms present in a protein molecule in comparison with a small organic compound, the basic 1D spectra become crowded with overlapping signals to an extent where direct spectral analysis becomes untenable. Therefore, multidimensional (2, 3 or 4D) experiments have been devised to deal with this problem. To facilitate these experiments, it is desirable to isotopically label the protein with C and N because the predominant naturally occurring isotope C is not NMR-active and the nuclear quadrupole moment of the predominant naturally occurring N isotope prevents high resolution information from being obtained from this nitrogen isotope. The most important method used for structure determination of proteins utilizes NOE experiments to measure distances between atoms within the molecule. Subsequently, the distances obtained are used to generate a 3D structure of the molecule by solving a distance geometry problem. NMR can also be used to obtain information on the dynamics and conformational flexibility of different regions of a protein.",

The central ~300 amino acids make up a catalytic core, in which all the residues necessary for catalysis are located, along with a non-covalently bound iron atom. The iron is held in place by two histidine residues and one glutamate residue, making it a non-heme, non-iron-sulfur iron-containing enzyme. The amino terminal ~150 amino acids make up a regulatory domain, thought to control access of substrates to the active site.

It has been suggested that this domain might be an intrinsically unstructured protein, which has no clearly defined tertiary structure, but so far no evidence has been presented supporting this claim. It has however been shown that the domain has a low occurrence of secondary structures, which doesn't weaken suspicions of it having a disordered overall structure. As for the tetramerization and catalytic domains their structure was found with rat tyrosine hydroxylase using X-ray crystallography.

It is also useful because enzymes can be purposefully manipulated by changing certain amino acids. If an amino acid is changed that is in close proximity to the active site, the kinetic parameters may change drastically, or the enzyme might behave in a different way. Another application of site directed mutagenesis is exchanging an amino acid residue far from the active site with a lysine residue or cysteine residue. These amino acids make it easier to covalently bond the enzyme to a solid surface, which allows for enzyme re-use and use of enzymes in continuous processes.
