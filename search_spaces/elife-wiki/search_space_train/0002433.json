KNM-ER 1802 is a lower-jaw fossil that is thought to be of a \"Homo rudolfensis\".

Roberts visits the Zhoukoudian caves, in which Peking Man, the supposed \"Homo erectus\" ancestor of the Chinese, was discovered. Roberts notes that some Chinese anthropologists and palaeontologists have shown modern Chinese physical characteristics in the fossil skulls, such as broad cheek bones, cranial skull shape and shovel-shaped incisors that are absent in almost all other humans. She also notes that the stone tools found in China seem more primitive than those elsewhere, and infers that they were made exclusively by \"Homo erectus\". However, she argues that the skull evidence is only subtle. She interviews an American palaeontologist, who presents his hypothesis that the ancient Chinese humans used bamboo instead of stone, explaining the absence of sophisticated stone tools, despite the absence of archaeological evidence to support this hypothesis. Finally, Roberts interviews Chinese geneticist Jin Li, who ran a study of more than 10,000 individuals scattered throughout China from 160 ethnic groups.

Researchers were curious to know if present day humans originated from Africa, or if they somehow, through anagenesis, were able to evolve from a single archaic species that lived in Afro-Eurasia. Milford H. Wolpoff is paleoanthropologist whose work done when studying human fossil records explored anagenesis as a hypothesis for hominin evolution. When looking at anagenesis in hominids, M. H. Wolpoff describes in terms of the \u2018single-species hypothesis,\u2019 which is characterized by thinking of the impact that culture has on a species as an adaptive system, and as an explanation to what conditions humans tend live in based on the environmental conditions, or ecological niche. When judging the effect culture has as this adaptive system, scientists must first look the modern Homo sapiens. Wolpoff contended that the ecological niche of past, extinct hominidae is distinct within the line of origin. Examining early Pliocene and late Miocenes findings helps to determine the corresponding importance of anagenesis vs. cladogenesis during the period of morphological differences. These findings propose that branches of the human and chimpanzee once diverged from each other. The hominin fossils go as far as 5 to 7 million years ago (Mya). Diversity on a species-level is able to be achieved through anagenesis. With collected data, only one or two early hominin were found to be relatively close to the Plio-Pleistocene range. Once more research was done, specifically with the fossils of \"A. anamensis\" and \"A. afarensis\", researchers were able to justify that these two hominin species were linked ancestrally.

Kimbel and other researchers, they viewed the history of early hominin fossils and concluded that actual macroevolution change via anagenesis was scarce.",

The genus \"Homo\" has been taken to originate some two millions ago since the discovery of stone tools in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, in the 1960s. \"Homo habilis\" (Leakey \"et al.\", 1964) would be the first \"human\" species (member of genus \"Homo\") by definition, its type specimen being the OH 7 fossils. However, the discovery of more fossils of this type has opened up the debate on the delineation of \"H. habilis\" from \"Australopithecus\". Especially, the  LD 350-1 jawbone fossil discovered in 2013, dated to 2.8 Mya, has been argued as being transitional between the two. Fossil KNM-ER 1470 (discovered in 1972, designated \"Pithecanthropus rudolfensis\" by Alekseyev 1978) is now seen as either a third early species of \"Homo\" (alongside \"H. habilis\" and \"H. erectus\") at about 2 million years ago, or alternatively as transitional between \"Australopithecus\" and \"Homo\".",

On September 13, 2013, two recreational cavers, Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker, discovered a previously unknown, remote chamber within the well known Rising Star cave system. Discovering the floor of this chamber (now known as the Dinaledi Chamber or UW-101) littered with human-like bones, the pair reported their finds to a colleague, who in turn brought them to the attention of Berger. Recognizing their importance, and unable to access the chamber himself due to his size, Berger organized an expedition over social media that brought six qualified researchers in from around the world to commence an excavation of the remains in November 2013. An early career workshop was organized in May 2014 that brought together 54 local and international scientists to describe and study the more than 1550 fossils recovered. In September 2015, the team announced \"Homo naledi\" as a new hominin species, citing its unique mosaic of more ancestral and human-like traits. Other fossil bearing localities in the system were given the site numbers 102 to 104, though research regarding them has not yet been published.",

The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the finger bone showed it to be genetically distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans. The nuclear genome from this specimen suggested that Denisovans shared a common origin with Neanderthals, that they ranged from Siberia to Southeast Asia, and that they lived among and interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans, with about 3% to 5% of the DNA of Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians and around 6% in Papuans deriving from Denisovans.",

Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like \"H. habilis\". The brain later grew in size, and \"H. erectus\" eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the Acheulean. Possibly the first hunters, \"H. erectus\" mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of Afro-Eurasia and perhaps later giving rise to \"Homo floresiensis\". Although some recent writers suggest that \"Homo georgicus\" was the first and most primitive hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider \"H. georgicus\" to be an early and primitive member of the \"H. erectus\" species. The fossil record shows \"Homo sapiens\" living in Southern and Eastern Africa at least 200,000 to 150,000 years ago.
