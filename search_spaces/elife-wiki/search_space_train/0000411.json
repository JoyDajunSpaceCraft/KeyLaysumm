In 1961, Osamu Shimomura extracted green fluorescent protein (GFP) and another bioluminescent protein, called aequorin, from the large and abundant hydromedusa \"Aequorea victoria\", while studying photoproteins that cause bioluminescence in this species. Three decades later, Douglas Prasher sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP. Martin Chalfie figured out how to use GFP as a fluorescent marker of genes inserted into other cells or organisms. Roger Tsien later chemically manipulated GFP to produce other fluorescent colors to use as markers. In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfie and Tsien won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work with GFP. Man-made GFP became commonly used as a fluorescent tag to show which cells or tissues express specific genes. The genetic engineering technique fuses the gene of interest to the GFP gene. The fused DNA is then put into a cell, to generate either a cell line or (via IVF techniques) an entire animal bearing the gene. In the cell or animal, the artificial gene turns on in the same tissues and the same time as the normal gene, making GFP instead of the normal protein. Illuminating the animal or cell reveals what tissues express that protein\u2014or at what stage of development. The fluorescence shows where the gene is expressed.",

In recent gene therapy trials, the lentiviral vectors used to insert therapeutic DNA showed no tendency to disrupt gene function or promote oncogenic development. Because of these advances, it is now considered safe to use such integrating vectors for gene therapy. An advantage is that the lentiviral vectors integrate the DNA permanently, whereas other, non-integrating, viruses' effect is transient. For those viruses such as gammaretroviruses that tend to integrate their DNA in genetically unfavorable locations, the severity of any ensuing mutation depends entirely on the location within the host's genome wherein the viral DNA is inserted. If the DNA is inserted into the middle of an essential gene, the effects on the cell will be drastic. Additionally, insertion into a gene's promoter region can have equally drastic effects. Likewise, if the viral DNA is inserted into a repressor, the promoter's corresponding gene may be over-expressed \u2013 leading to an overabundance of its product and altered cellular activity.

It is often used as a tool in basic research and is actively researched as a potential means for gene therapy.

This plasmid is inserted (usually by transfection) into a producer cell together with other plasmids (DNA constructs) that carry the viral genes required for formation of infectious virions. In these producer cells, the viral proteins expressed by these packaging constructs bind the sequences on the DNA/RNA (depending on the type of viral vector) to be transferred and insert it into viral particles. For safety, none of the plasmids used contains all the sequences required for virus formation, so that simultaneous transfection of multiple plasmids is required to get infectious virions. Moreover, only the plasmid carrying the sequences to be transferred contains signals that allow the genetic materials to be packaged in virions, so that none of the genes encoding viral proteins are packaged. Viruses collected from these cells are then applied to the cells to be altered. The initial stages of these infections mimic infection with natural viruses and lead to expression of the genes transferred and (in the case of lentivirus/retrovirus vectors) insertion of the DNA to be transferred into the cellular genome. However, since the transferred genetic material does not encode any of the viral genes, these infections do not generate new viruses (the viruses are \"replication-deficient\").",

DNA and histone are covered with chemical tags known as the epigenome, which shapes the physical structure of the genome. It tightly wraps inactive genes on the DNA sequence making those genes unreadable while loosely wrapping active genes making them more expressive. The more tightly wrapped the gene, the less it will be expressed in the organism. These epigenetic tags react to stimuli presented from the outside world. It adjusts specific genes in the genome to respond to humans' rapidly changing environments.  The idea of epigenetics and gene expression has been a theory applied to the origins of homosexuality in humans. One team of researchers examined the effects of epi-marks buffering XX fetuses and XY fetuses from certain androgen exposure and used published data on fetal androgen signaling and gene regulation through non-genetic changes in DNA packaging to develop a new model for homosexuality. The researchers found that stronger than average epi-marks, epigenomes that are wrapped tightly around the DNA sequence, convert sexual preference in individuals without altering genitalia or sexual identity. This research gives support to the hypothesis that homosexuality stems from the under expression of certain genes on the DNA sequence involved with sexual preferences. This theory as well as other concepts involved with epi-marks, twin studies, and fetal androgen signaling will be explored here.",

In fact, when a transposon inserts itself in a gene, the gene's function will be disrupted. Because of that property, transposons have been manipulated for use in insertional mutagenesis. The development of microbial genome sequencing was a major advance for the use of transposon mutagenesis. The function affected by a transposon insertion could be linked to the disrupted gene by sequencing the genome to locate the transposon insertion site. Massively parallel sequencing allows simultaneous sequencing of transposon insertion sites in large mixtures of different mutants. Therefore, genome-wide analysis is feasible if transposons are positioned throughout the genome in a mutant collection.",

After his short time there, he accepted a faculty position at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Beachy began focusing on the Drosophila hedgehog gene, for which he\u2019s known for, in 1990. The gene\u2019s name originated because fly embryos look spikey if the hedgehog gene is faulty or mutated. The hedgehog gene\u2019s main function is to create protein signals in specific cells. These signals, in turn, allow for the formation of embryonic tissues. They do this by instructing neighboring cells to become a certain type of differentiated cell or to simply divide. In other words, this gene is responsible for the development of the appendages and body segments in Drosophila or fruit flies. Humans and other invertebrates have hedgehog genes that behave slightly different than the same gene in the fruit fly. In vertebrates, the hedgehog gene codes for the fingers and toes on the limbs. It also functions in organizing the brain and the spinal cord. Consequently, mutated hedgehog genes often cause birth defects. Also, if it is activated later in life, certain cancers can be triggered and begin to spread.",

QF, QF2 and QF2 are analogous to GAL4 and LexA, and their expression is usually under the control of cell-type specific promoter, such as \"nsyb\" (to target neurons) or \"tubulin\" (to target all cells). QUAS is analogous to UAS and LexAop, and is placed upstream of an effector gene, such as GFP. QS is analogous to GAL80, and may be driven by any promoter (e.g. \"tubulin-QS\"). Quinic acid is a unique feature of the Q-system, and it must be fed to the flies or maggots in order to alleviate the QS-induced repression. In some ways, quinic acid is analogous to temperature in the case of GAL80. In its basic form, two transgenic fly lines, one containing a QF transgene and the other one containing a QUAS transgene, are crossed together. Their progeny that had both a QF transgene and a QUAS transgene will be expressing a reporter gene in a subset of cells (e.g. \"nsyb-QF2, QUAS-GFP\" flies express GFP in all neurons). If a fly also expresses QS in some of the cells, the activity of QF will be repressed in these cells, but it may be restored of a fly is fed quinic acid (e.g. a \"nsyb-QF2, QUAS-GFP, tub-QS\" fly expresses no GFP when its diet doesn't contain quinic acid, and expresses GFP in its neurons when fed quinic acid). The use of QS repressor and quinic acid allows to fine-tune the temporal control of transgene expression.",

An international committee published recommendations for genetic symbols and nomenclature in 1957. The need to develop formal guidelines for human gene names and symbols was recognized in the 1960s and full guidelines were issued in 1979 (Edinburgh Human Genome Meeting). Several other genus-specific research communities (e.g., \"Drosophila\" fruit flies, \"Mus\" mice) have adopted nomenclature standards, as well, and have published them on the relevant model organism websites and in scientific journals, including the \"Trends in Genetics\" Genetic Nomenclature Guide. Scientists familiar with a particular gene family may work together to revise the nomenclature for the entire set of genes when new information becomes available. For many genes and their corresponding proteins, an assortment of alternate names is in use across the scientific literature and public biological databases, posing a challenge to effective organization and exchange of biological information. Standardization of nomenclature thus tries to achieve the benefits of vocabulary control and bibliographic control, although adherence is voluntary. The advent of the information age has brought gene ontology, which in some ways is a next step of gene nomenclature, because it aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species.",

In searching for the gene responsible for SCS, scientists at Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center began studying the TWIST gene because its effects on mice. The TWIST gene in mice, functions in the development of the muscle and skeleton of the face, head, hands, and feet. Mice that were lacking both copies of the TWIST gene were spontaneously aborted prior to birth, and had serious deformities including abnormal limb and head defects and failure of the neural tube to properly close. However, mice with a single copy of the non-working TWIST gene survived. Further examination revealed that these mice had only minor skull, hand, and foot defects similar to those seen in SCS. The mouse TWIST gene is located on chromosome 12 in mice, which corresponds to the short arm of chromosome 7 in humans. With this information, scientists began to isolate and map the human TWIST gene on the short arm of human chromosome 7. They revealed that the human TWIST gene was in the same region that was absent in people with SCS. While looking for different mutations in the human TWIST gene, five different types of mutations were discovered in individuals with SCS. Since none of these mutations were seen in normal individuals who didn't have SCS, this provided enough evidence to conclude that the TWIST gene was the causative agent of SCS1. Researchers also studied the TWIST gene in \"Drosophila\" (fruit fly) in order to determine its function. They discovered that in the presence of two TWIST protein molecules combined together, the TWIST gene functions as a DNA transcription factor, meaning it binds to the DNA double-helix at specific locations in order to control which genes are \"turned on\" or activated. The majority of the identified mutations in the TWIST gene interfere with how the protein attaches to DNA, preventing the activation of other genes that would normally be turned on during fetal development.",

Yeast two hybrid allows the identification of pairwise PPIs (binary method) \"in vivo\", in which the two proteins are tested for biophysically direct interaction. The Y2H is based on the functional reconstitution of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and subsequent activation of a selective reporter such as His3. To test two proteins for interaction, two protein expression constructs are made: one protein (X) is fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DB) and a second protein (Y) is fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD). In the assay, yeast cells are transformed with these constructs. Transcription of reporter genes does not occur unless bait (DB-X) and prey (AD-Y) interact with each other and form a functional Gal4 transcription factor. Thus, the interaction between proteins can be inferred by the presence of the products resultant of the reporter gene expression. In cases in which the reporter gene expresses enzymes that allow the yeast to synthesize essential amino acids or nucleotides, yeast growth under selective media conditions indicates that the two proteins tested are interacting.",
