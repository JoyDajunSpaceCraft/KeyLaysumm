Another major accomplishment was the discovery of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), a key protein made up of six subunits that binds to cellular origins of DNA replication and coordinates the entire process of initiating a complete cycle of DNA replication throughout the entire cell genome. Soon after the discovery of ORC, Stillman\u2019s group identified other initiation proteins that together form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC), which makes chromosomes competent for the subsequent initiation of DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle. His group\u2019s recent studies have revealed the intricate details of the mechanism of the initiation of DNA replication and illuminated how this process is regulated throughout the cell cycle, including the mechanisms that prevent DNA replication from occurring more than once during each cell cycle. These studies include elucidation of the structure of ORC and its associated pre-RC proteins.",

Origin licensing is the preliminary step for normal replication initiation during late G1 and early S phase and involves the recruitment of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) to the replication origins. Licensing begins with the binding of the multi-subunit ATPase, the origin recognition complex (ORC), to the DNA at the replication origins. Once bound to chromatin the ORC recruits the AAA+ ATPase Cdc6 and the coiled-coil domain protein Cdt1. Cdt1 binding and the ATPase activity of ORC and Cdc6 facilitate the loading of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins 2-7 onto the chromatin. The MCM complex is the DNA helicase that opens the helix at the replication origin and unwinds the two strands as the replication forks travel along the DNA. Elevated CDK activity at the end of G1 triggers the firing of the origins and the dismantling of the pre-RCs. High CDK levels, which are maintained until the end of mitosis, inhibit or destroy pre-RC components and prevent the origin from relicensing. A new MCM complex cannot be loaded onto the origin until the pre-RC subunits are reactivated with the decline of CDK activity at the end of mitosis. Thus, CDKs serve a dual role in the regulation of eukaryotic DNA replication: elevated CDK activity initiates replication at the origins and prevents rereplication by inhibiting origin re-licensing. This ensures that no replication origin fires twice in the same cell cycle.",

The DNA segments carrying this genetic information are called genes. Likewise, other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information. Along with RNA and proteins, DNA is one of the three major macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. DNA consists of two long polymers of simple units called nucleotides, with backbones made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are, therefore, anti-parallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the genetic code, which specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA in a process called transcription. Within cells DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA.

Due to this, yeast can produce complex proteins that are identical or very similar to native products from plants or mammals. The first yeast expression platform was based on the baker\u2019s yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\". However since then a variety of yeast expression platforms have been studied and are widely used for various applications based on their different characteristics and capabilities. For instance some of them grow on a wide range of carbon sources and are not restricted to glucose, as it is the case with baker\u2019s yeast.

In bacteria, the protein RNase PH, which is involved in tRNA processing, forms a hexameric ring consisting of six identical RNase PH proteins. In the case of PNPase, which is a phosphorolytic RNA-degrading protein found in bacteria and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some eukaryotic organisms, two RNase PH domains, and both an S1 and KH RNA binding domain are part of a single protein, which forms a trimeric complex that adopts a structure almost identical to that of the exosome. Because of this high similarity in both protein domains and structure, these complexes are thought to be evolutionarily related and have a common ancestor. In bacteria, a separate RNase PH protein exists that is involved in transfer RNA processing, which has been shown to adopt a similar six-membered ring structure, but in this case consisting of 6 identical protein subunits.

Furthermore, several additional proteins are found in the small and large subunits of eukaryotic ribosomes, which do not have prokaryotic homologs. The 40S subunit contains a 18S ribosomal RNA (abbreviated 18S rRNA), which is homologous to the prokaryotic 16S rRNA. The 60S subunit contains a 28S rRNA that is homologous to the prokaryotic 23S ribosomal RNA. In addition, it contains a 5.8S rRNA that corresponds to the 5' end of the 23S rRNA, and a short 5S rRNA. Both 18S and 28S have multiple insertions to the core rRNA fold of their prokaryotic counterparts, which are called expansion segments. For a detailed list of proteins, including archaeal and bacterial homologs please refer to the separate articles on the 40S and 60S subunits. Recent research suggests heterogeneity in the ribosomal composition, i.e., that the stoichiometry among core ribosomal proteins in wild-type yeast cells and embryonic stem cells depends both on the growth conditions and on the number of ribosomes bound per mRNA. Initial structures of eukaryotic ribosomes were determined by electron microscopy. First 3D structures were obtained at 30-40 \u00c5 resolution for yeast and mammalian ribosomes. Higher resolution structures of the yeast ribosome by cryo-electron microscopy allowed the identification of protein and RNA structural elements. More recently structures at sub-nanometer resolution were obtained for complexes of ribosomes and factors involved in translation. After the determination of the first bacterial and archaeal ribosome structures at atomic resolution in the 1990s, it took another decade until in 2011, high resolution structures of eukaryotic ribosome were obtained by X-ray crystallography, mainly because of the difficulties in obtaining crystals of sufficient quality. The complete structure of a eukaryotic 40S ribosomal structure in \"Tetrahymena thermophila\" was published and described, as well as much about the 40S subunit's interaction with eIF1 during translation initiation. The eukaryotic 60S subunit structure was also determined from \"T. thermophila\" in complex with eIF6. The complete structure of the eukaryotic 80S ribosome from the yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" was obtained by crystallography at 3.0 A resolution.

Origin licensing is the preliminary step for normal replication initiation during late G1 and early S phase and involves the recruitment of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) to the replication origins. Licensing begins with the binding of the multi-subunit ATPase, the origin recognition complex (ORC), to the DNA at the replication origins. Once bound to chromatin the ORC recruits the AAA+ ATPase Cdc6 and the coiled-coil domain protein Cdt1. Cdt1 binding and the ATPase activity of ORC and Cdc6 facilitate the loading of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins 2-7 onto the chromatin. The MCM complex is the DNA helicase that opens the helix at the replication origin and unwinds the two strands as the replication forks travel along the DNA. Elevated CDK activity at the end of G1 triggers the firing of the origins and the dismantling of the pre-RCs. High CDK levels, which are maintained until the end of mitosis, inhibit or destroy pre-RC components and prevent the origin from relicensing. A new MCM complex cannot be loaded onto the origin until the pre-RC subunits are reactivated with the decline of CDK activity at the end of mitosis. Thus, CDKs serve a dual role in the regulation of eukaryotic DNA replication: elevated CDK activity initiates replication at the origins and prevents rereplication by inhibiting origin re-licensing.

The Pol\u03b4 enzyme is responsible for synthesizing the lagging strand of DNA, and has also been implicated in some activities at the leading strand (Figure 1). The POLD1/p125 subunit encodes both DNA polymerizing and exonuclease domains, which provide the protein an important second function in proofreading to ensure replication accuracy during DNA synthesis, and in a number of types of replication-linked DNA repair following DNA damage. Germline mutations impairing activity of POLD1 have been implicated in several types of hereditary cancer, in some sporadic cancers, and in a developmental syndrome of premature aging, Mandibular hypoplasia, Deafness, and Progeroid features and Lipodystrophy (MDPL/MDP syndrome). Studies of POLD1 emphasize the importance of maintaining genomic stability to limit tumorigenesis. It is currently unclear whether the enhanced tumorigenesis associated with \"POLD1\" defects is the result of increased base substitutions or due to fork collapse and production of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Recent reviews have addressed important functions of POLD1 and Pol\u03b4.",

The \"S. cerevisiae\" ORC requires the five largest subunits, Orc1, Orc2, Orc3, Orc4, and Orc5, to recognize DNA, four of which (Orc1p, 2p, 4p, and 5p) remain in close contact with the origin. The Orc1 and Orc5 subunits are known to interact with ATP, but only the interaction between the Orc1 subunit and ATP are required for DNA binding. The \"S. cerevisiae\" Orc1 subunit also hydrolyzes ATP; however ATP hydrolysis is not required for DNA binding. Once the ORC is bound to the origin, the complex is retained in an ATP-bound state and the ATP hydrolysis is reserved for a downstream step in initiation.",

No atomic-resolution structures of the entire SWI/SNF complex have been obtained to date, due to the protein complex being highly dynamic and composed of many subunits. However, domains and several individual subunits from yeast and mammals have been described. In particular, the cryo-EM structure of the ATPase Snf2 in complex with a nucleosome shows that nucleosomal DNA is locally deformed at the site of binding. A model of the mammalian ATPase SMARCA4 shows similar features, based on the high degree of sequence homology with yeast Snf2. The interface between two subunits, BAF155 (SMARCC1) and BAF47 (SMARCB1) was also resolved, providing important insights into the mechanisms of the SWI/SNF complex assembly pathway.",

            "document": "Chemical biology . Protein misfolding has previously been studied using both computational approaches as well as \"in vivo\" biological assays in model organisms such as \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and \"C. elegans\". Computational models use a \"de novo\" process to calculate possible protein structures based on input parameters such as amino acid sequence, solvent effects, and mutations. This method has the shortcoming that the cell environment has been drastically simplified, which limits the factors that influence folding and stability. On the other hand, biological assays can be quite complicated to perform \"in vivo\" with high-throughput like efficiency and there always remains the question of how well lower organism systems approximate human systems. Dobson et al. propose combining these two approaches such that computational models based on the organism studies can begin to predict what factors will lead to protein misfolding. Several experiments have already been performed based on this strategy. In experiments on \"Drosophila\", different mutations of beta amyloid peptides were evaluated based on the survival rates of the flies as well as their motile ability. The findings from the study show that the more a protein aggregates, the more detrimental the neurological dysfunction. Further studies using transthyretin, a component of cerebrospinal fluid that binds to beta amyloid peptide deterring aggregation but can itself aggregate especially when mutated, indicate that aggregation prone proteins may not aggregate where they are secreted and rather are deposited in specific organs or tissues based on each mutation. Kelly et al. have shown that the more stable, both kinetically and thermodynamically, a misfolded protein is the more likely the cell is to secrete it from the endoplasmic reticulum rather than targeting the protein for degradation. In addition, the more stress that a cell feels from misfolded proteins the more probable new proteins will misfold. These experiments as well as others having begun to elucidate both the intrinsic and extrinsic causes of misfolding as well as how the cell recognizes if proteins have folded correctly.",

Pol \u03b1 (alpha), Pol \u03b4 (delta), and Pol \u03b5 (epsilon) are members of Family B Polymerases and are the main polymerases involved with nuclear DNA replication. Pol \u03b1 complex (pol \u03b1-DNA primase complex) consists of four subunits: the catalytic subunit POLA1, the regulatory subunit POLA2, and the small and the large primase subunits PRIM1 and PRIM2 respectively. Once primase has created the RNA primer, Pol \u03b1 starts replication elongating the primer with ~20 nucleotides. Due to its high processivity, Pol \u03b4 takes over the leading and lagging strand synthesis from Pol \u03b1. Pol \u03b4 is expressed by genes POLD1, creating the catalytic subunit, POLD2, POLD3, and POLD4 creating the other subunits that interact with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), which is a DNA clamp that allows Pol \u03b4 to possess processivity. Pol \u03b5 is encoded by the POLE1, the catalytic subunit, POLE2, and POLE3 gene. It has been reported that the function of Pol \u03b5 is to extend the leading strand during replication, while Pol \u03b4 primarily replicates the lagging strand; however, recent evidence suggested that Pol \u03b4 might have a role in replicating the leading strand of DNA as well. Pol \u03b5's C-terminus region is thought to be essential to cell vitality as well. The C-terminus region is thought to provide a checkpoint before entering anaphase, provide stability to the holoenzyme, and add proteins to the holoenzyme necessary for initiation of replication.",

The \"S. cerevisiae\" homolog of the \"E. coli\" protein (that is, the H2A subunit) was easily identifiable by bioinformatics when the yeast genome was sequenced, but the corresponding protein was found not to have enzymatic activity in isolation. Eventually, the yeast B and C subunits were isolated by co-purification and found to be required for enzymatic activity. However, the yeast B and C subunits have very low sequence identity to their homologs in other organisms, and the corresponding human proteins were conclusively identified only after mutations in all three were found to cause Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e8res syndrome.",

When Watson and Crick produced their double helix model of DNA, it was known that most of the specialized features of the many different life forms on Earth are made possible by proteins. Structurally, proteins are long chains of amino acid subunits. In some way, the genetic molecule, DNA, had to contain instructions for how to make the thousands of proteins found in cells. From the DNA double helix model, it was clear that there must be some correspondence between the linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules to the linear sequences of amino acids in proteins. The details of how sequences of DNA instruct cells to make specific proteins was worked out by molecular biologists during the period from 1953 to 1965. Francis Crick played an integral role in both the theory and analysis of the experiments that led to an improved understanding of the genetic code.",
