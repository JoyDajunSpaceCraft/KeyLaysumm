            "document": "Heat shock . The cellular response to heat shock damage, the heat shock response, includes the transcriptional up-regulation of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs) as part of the cell's internal repair mechanism. The effects of stressors such as temperature changes and toxins are counteracted by these HSPs, that upon activation respond to heat, cold and oxygen deprivation by activating several cascade pathways. HSPs are also present in cells under perfectly normal conditions, but an elevation in stress levels for the cell promotes an increase in their production levels by activating heat-shock genes at levels higher than normal. Some HSPs, called chaperones, also have increased production levels when the cell faces various stress factors. Chaperone's functions includes making sure that the cell\u2019s proteins are properly folded in the correct conformation and they ensure this by facilitating protein folding using their substrate binding domain. An example of chaperons are the HSP70 (heat shock protein) chaperones. For example, HSPs help new or misfolded proteins to fold into their correct three-dimensional conformations, which is essential for their function. They also shuttle proteins from one compartment to another inside the cell, and target old or terminally misfolded proteins to proteases for degradation. Heat shock proteins are also believed to play a role in the presentation of pieces of proteins (or peptides) on the cell surface to help the immune system recognize diseased cells. 5 major families of HSPs are recognized: the Hsp70 (DnaK) family, the chaperonins (GroEL and Hsp60), the Hsp90 family, the Hsp100 (Clp) family and the small HSP (sHSP) family. Other proteins such as, protein disulfide isomerase and calnexin/calreticulin, have chaperone functions and assist protein folding in the Endoplasmic Reticulum.",

This protein binds to chromatin prior to DNA damage and is phosphorylated by ATR after the damage. This protein recruits the RAD1-RAD9-HUS1 checkpoint protein complex onto chromatin after DNA damage, which may be required for its phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of this protein is required for the DNA-damage-induced cell cycle G2 arrest, and is thought to be a critical early event during checkpoint signaling in DNA-damaged cells.

Heat shock refers to cellular exposure to rapid stress changes such as temperature, toxins, oxidative stress, heavy metals, and pathogenic infections. Specifically temperature induced heat shock, even of a few degrees, has the potential to disrupt proper protein folding. As a result, proteins can fold incorrectly, or become entangled which can results in nonspecific aggregation. Other cellular damages induced by heat shock include cytoskeletal rearrangement, changes in organelle localization, decrease in ATP production, unsafe drop in cellular pH levels, decreased translation of proteins, and changes in RNA splicing. Introduction of heat shock to cells elicits the molecular response, the heat shock response (HSR), which repairs damages caused by stressors such as protein misfolding and protein aggregation.",

In addition to this regulation of transcription, observations of PML-NBs have strongly suggested that the protein complex plays a role in mediating DNA-damage responses.

The nuclear bodies localize to the site of DNA damage, where proteins associated with the repair of DNA and halting of the cell cycle then co-localize. The functional purpose of the interaction between PML-NBs and DNA repair mechanisms remains unclear, but it seems unlikely that they have a role in repairing the DNA directly, due to the co-localization of DNA repair proteins and PML-NBs some time after the DNA has been damaged. Rather, it is thought that PML-NBs may regulate responses to DNA damage by acting as a storage site for proteins involved in DNA repair, regulating the repair directly, or mediating between DNA repair and checkpoint responses. However, it is clear that PML-NBs play a role in mediating checkpoint responses, particularly in causing apoptosis.",

            "document": "Carcinogenesis . Cancers are known to exhibit genome instability or a mutator phenotype. The protein-coding DNA within the nucleus is about 1.5% of the total genomic DNA. Within this protein-coding DNA (called the exome), an average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein altering mutations, of which about 3 or 4 may be \"driver\" mutations, and the remaining ones may be \"passenger\" mutations. However, the average number of DNA sequence mutations in the entire genome (including non-protein-coding regions) within a breast cancer tissue sample is about 20,000. In an average melanoma tissue sample (where melanomas have a higher exome mutation frequency) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000. These high frequencies of mutations in the total nucleotide sequences within cancers suggest that often an early alteration in the field defect giving rise to a cancer (e.g. yellow area in the diagram in the preceding section) is a deficiency in DNA repair. Large field defects surrounding colon cancers (extending to about 10\u00a0cm on each side of a cancer) are found to frequently have epigenetic defects in 2 or 3 DNA repair proteins (ERCC1, XPF and/or PMS2) in the entire area of the field defect. When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damages accumulate in cells at a higher than normal level, and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation. Mutation rates strongly increase in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR). A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone translesion synthesis past some of those damages may give rise to mutations. In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to epimutations. These new mutations and/or epimutations may provide a proliferative advantage, generating a field defect. Although the mutations/epimutations in DNA repair genes do not, themselves, confer a selective advantage, they may be carried along as passengers in cells when the cell acquires an additional mutation/epimutation that does provide a proliferative advantage.",

The SDT domain of the MDC1 protein is phosphorylated by caseine kinase 2 (CK2) which allows it to bind another MRN complex, the MDC1 protein can sense the DNA damage by binding to the \u03b3H2AX flag through its BRCT domain and brings the bound MRN complex to the site of damaged DNA and it facilitates the recruitment and retention of another ATM kinase. The second ATM kinase phosphorylates the TQXF domain on MDC1 which allows it to recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8, which will ubiquitinate the histones near the DSB which initiates further ubiquitination of the chromatin around the site of damage by other factors of the DDR.

The ability of histone acetyltransferases to manipulate chromatin structure and lay an epigenetic framework makes them essential in cell maintenance and survival. The process of chromatin remodeling involves several enzymes, including HATs, that assist in the reformation of nucleosomes and are required for DNA damage repair systems to function. HATs have been implicated as accessories to disease progression, specifically in neurodegenerative disorders. For instance, Huntington's disease is a disease that affects motor skills and mental abilities. The only known mutation that has been implicated in the disease is in the N-terminal region of the protein huntingtin (htt). It has been reported that htt directly interacts with HATs and represses the catalytic activity of p300/CBP and PCAF \"in vitro\". HATs have also been associated with control of learning and memory functions. Studies have shown that mice without PCAF or CBP display evidence of neurodegeneration. Mice with PCAF deletion are incompetent with respect to learning, and those with CBP deletion seem to suffer from long-term memory loss. The misregulation of the equilibrium between acetylation and deacetylation has also been associated with the manifestation of certain cancers. If histone acetyltransferases are inhibited, then damaged DNA may not be repaired, eventually leading to cell death. Controlling the chromatin remodeling process within cancer cells may provide a novel drug target for cancer research. Attacking these enzymes within cancer cells could lead to increased apoptosis due to high accumulation of DNA damage. One such inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases is called garcinol. This compound is found within the rinds of the garcinia indica fruit, otherwise known as mangosteen. To explore the effects of garcinol on histone acetyltransferases, researchers used HeLa cells. The cells underwent irradiation, creating double-strand breaks within the DNA, and garcinol was introduced into the cells to see if it influenced the DNA damage response. If garcinol is successful at inhibiting the process of non-homologous end joining, a DNA repair mechanism that shows preference in fixing double-strand breaks, then it may serve as a radiosensitizer, a molecule that increases the sensitivity of cells to radiation damage. Increases in radiosensitivity may increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy.",

The cellular response to heat shock damage, the heat shock response, includes the transcriptional up-regulation of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs) as part of the cell's internal repair mechanism. The effects of stressors such as temperature changes and toxins are counteracted by these HSPs, that upon activation respond to heat, cold and oxygen deprivation by activating several cascade pathways. HSPs are also present in cells under perfectly normal conditions, but an elevation in stress levels for the cell promotes an increase in their production levels by activating heat-shock genes at levels higher than normal. Some HSPs, called chaperones, also have increased production levels when the cell faces various stress factors. Chaperone's functions includes making sure that the cell\u2019s proteins are properly folded in the correct conformation and they ensure this by facilitating protein folding using their substrate binding domain. An example of chaperons are the HSP70 (heat shock protein) chaperones. For example, HSPs help new or misfolded proteins to fold into their correct three-dimensional conformations, which is essential for their function. They also shuttle proteins from one compartment to another inside the cell, and target old or terminally misfolded proteins to proteases for degradation. Heat shock proteins are also believed to play a role in the presentation of pieces of proteins (or peptides) on the cell surface to help the immune system recognize diseased cells. 5 major families of HSPs are recognized: the Hsp70 (DnaK) family, the chaperonins (GroEL and Hsp60), the Hsp90 family, the Hsp100 (Clp) family and the small HSP (sHSP) family. Other proteins such as, protein disulfide isomerase and calnexin/calreticulin, have chaperone functions and assist protein folding in the Endoplasmic Reticulum.",

Traditionally, cancer has been viewed as a genetic disease that is driven by sequential acquisition of mutations, leading to the constitutive activation of proto-oncogenes and the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes. However, it has become increasingly evident that tumor development also involves epigenetic changes. These epigenetic changes include both genome-wide losses and regional gains of DNA methylation, as well as altered patterns of histone modification. The state of compaction of the chromatin fiber governs DNA accessibility and therefore has a crucial function establishing, maintaining, and propagating distinct patterns of gene expression. Perturbations of chromatin structure can cause inappropriate gene expression and genomic instability, resulting in cellular transformation and malignant outgrowth. Polycomb group proteins (PcG) function as transcriptional repressors that silence specific sets of genes through chromatin modification. Although they are primarily known for their role in maintaining cell identity during the establishment of the body plan, several mammalian PcG members are implicated in the control of cellular proliferation and neoplastic development.",

PcG proteins have been found to associate with such genes, serving to either directly or indirectly alter their levels of expression through epigenetic modifications. c-Myc is a canonical oncogene that has been shown to associate with members of the PcG proteins. Normally, c-Myc is highly expressed in immature cells but has almost no perceivable expression in mature/differentiated cells. Its roles in the cell cycle and apoptosis help cells maintain an immature state, and its expression wanes as cells begin to differentiate. Bmi-1 and Myc were found to be partners within the cell nucleus. Interestingly, Bmi-1 and c-Myc seem to function in tandem in multiple ways. Studies have found that together c-Myc and Bmi-1 possess the ability to alter tumor suppressor genes. Hypoactive c-Myc was shown to alter p16 via Bmi-1, while hyperactive c-Myc was capable of altering the p16 promoter itself [28]. Normally, p16 functions to prevent cells from progressing through the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle too quickly. Altering this function helps drive cells to proliferate uncontrollably making them more tumorigenic in nature. Hence, these data present a model in which c-Myc and Bmi-1 alter cellular apoptosis via cell cycle regulator genes. Conversely, another protein has been shown to alter Bmi-1 in such a way that negates its association with c-Myc and ultimately reduces its tumorigenic capacity. Researchers found that Akt phosphorylate Bmi-1 at Serine 316 (Ser316), thus inhibiting its chromatin-modifying function, suppressing its growth-promoting potential, promoting the derepression of the \"Ink4a-Arf\" locus, and decreasing cellular transformation activities with c-Myc.",

It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a methylase domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in methylation state of DNA in that region will subsequently result. Transcription rates of genes so-affected will be reduced. Many of the effector domains function to modulate either the DNA directly - e.g. via methylation, cleaving, or recombination of the target DNA sequence - or by modulating its transcription rate - e.g. inhibiting transcription via repressor domains that block transcriptional machinery, promoting transcription with activation domains that recruit transcriptional machinery to the site, or histone- or other epigenetic-modification domains that affect chromatin state and the ability of transcriptional machinery to access the affected genes. Epigenetic modification is a major theme in determining varying expression levels for genes, as explained by the idea that how tightly-wound the DNA strand is - from histones at the local level up to chromatin at the chromosomal level - can influence the accessibility of sequences of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing the rate at which it can be transcribed. If, instead of impacting the DNA strand directly, as described above, a designer zinc-finger protein instead affects epigenetic modification state for a target DNA region, modulation of gene expression could similarly be accomplished. In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression in vivo, Choo \"et al\" designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. This specific oncogene is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The oncogene typically enables leukemia cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of cancer. By including a nuclear localization signal with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo \"et al\" were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo. Leukemia cells became dependent on regular growth factors, bringing the cell cycle back under the control of normal regulation.",

Some miRNAs also undergo methylation-associated silencing in cancer cells. Let-7 and miR15/16 play important roles in down-regulating RAS and BCL2 oncogenes, and their silencing occurs in cancer cells. Decreased expression of miR-125b1, a miRNA that functions as a tumor suppressor, was observed in prostate, ovarian, breast and glial cell cancers. In vitro experiments have shown that miR-125b1 targets two genes, HER2/neu and ESR1, that are linked to breast cancer. DNA methylation, specifically hypermethylation, is one of the main ways that the miR-125b1 is epigenetically silenced. In patients with breast cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands located proximal to the transcription start site was observed. Loss of CTCF binding and an increase in repressive histone marks, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, correlates with DNA methylation and miR-125b1 silencing. Mechanistically, CTCF may function as a boundary element to stop the spread of DNA methylation. Results from experiments conducted by Soto-Reyes et al. indicate a negative effect of methylation on the function and expression of miR-125b1. Therefore, they concluded that DNA methylation has a part in silencing the gene. Furthermore, some miRNA's are epigenetically silenced early on in breast cancer, and therefore these miRNA's could potentially be useful as tumor markers. The epigenetic silencing of miRNA genes by aberrant DNA methylation is a frequent event in cancer cells; almost one third of miRNA promoters active in normal mammary cells were found hypermethylated in breast cancer cells - that is a several fold greater proportion than is usually observed for protein coding genes.  DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms).",

Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs.",

In \"Drosophila\", the Trithorax-group (trxG) and Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins act antagonistically and interact with chromosomal elements, termed Cellular Memory Modules (CMMs). Trithorax-group (trxG) proteins maintain the active state of gene expression while the Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins counteract this activation with a repressive function that is stable over many cell generations and can only be overcome by germline differentiation processes. Polycomb Gene complexes or PcG silencing consist of at least three kinds of multiprotein complex Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), PRC2 and PhoRC. These complexes work together to carry out their repressive effect. PcGs proteins are evolutionarily conserved and exist in at least two separate protein complexes; the PcG repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the PcG repressive complex 2\u20134 (PRC2/3/4). PRC2 catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3), while PRC1 mono- ubiquitinates histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub1).",

Firstly, they may alter gene expression and have been found to upregulate specific genes involved in pro-tumorigenic pathways including heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). They can also interfere with the function of tumour suppressor genes, such as Tumour protein p53, leading to higher rates of cell proliferation due to the loss of control of the cell cycle. Additionally, CAF have the ability to break down proteins in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes leading to disruption to the normal structure allowing cells to move away from their primary region. The group of proteins known as the matrix metalloproteinases are key to this process. CAF also direct the movement of neoplastic cells by using the Rho-dependent signaling pathway to create tracks for these cells in the matrix.",

As tissue gene expression is largely regulated by epigenetic interactions, certain tissue-specific cancers are difficult to target with epigenetic therapies. Additionally, genes that encode for elements that prevent one type of cancer in a cell, may have altered function in another and lead to another type of cancer. Trying to modify these proteins, such as EZH2, may give rise to other types of cancer. Selectivity is another hurdle in the development of therapies. Since many proteins are structurally similar, especially within the same protein family, Broad-spectrum inhibitors can't always be used since modifying the regulation of one protein may do the same to others in the family.",

            "document": "Proneural genes . Proneural proteins bind DNA as heterodimeric complexes that are formed by bHLH proteins or E proteins. Because heterodimerization is a prerequisite for DNA binding, factors that interfere with dimerization effectively act as passive repressors of proneural gene activity. Proneural proteins specifically bind DNA sequences that contain a core hexanucleotide motif, CANNTG, known as an E-box. The basic region and helix 1 of the bHLH domain form a long alpha-helix that is connected with the loop region to helix 2. Direct contacts between bHLH residues and DNA are responsible for the common ability of neural bHLH proteins to bind to the core E-boxsequence. The cells within a cluster that express a proneural gene (called a proneural cluster) can be thought of as cells of an equivalence group. Within a proneural cluster, the cells compete with each other, such that only a subset of cells is singled out to develop into neuronal precursors. This singling out process is mediated by cell-cell interactions interpreted through the action of neurogenic genes. In neuroectoderm, neurogenic genes are required to single out cells from within proneural clusters to form neuronal precursors, leaving the remaining cells of proneural clusters to develop into epidermal cells. Proneural genes may function in analogous fashions in vertebrates and invertebrates, specifically they were implicated in early neurogenesis. Although proneural proteins are responsible for trigger neurogenesis, different proteins are required for different neural and/or glial cell types. This implies that each of these proteins is capable of regulating both common target genes for neurogenesis and unique target genes for neuronal subtype characteristics. Proneural bHLH transcription factors, not only drive neurogenesis by activating the expression of a cascade of neuronal genes, but they inhibit the expression of glial genes. Neural bHLH genes have different functions depending on: the sensitivity to lateral inhibition, which determines if a cell becomes epidermal or neuronal, and whether the gene is expressed in the CNS before or after the terminal mitosis.",

Most epigenetic changes only occur within the course of one individual organism's lifetime; however, these epigenetic changes can be transmitted to the organism's offspring through a process called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.
