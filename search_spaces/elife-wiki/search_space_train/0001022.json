Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform certain routines repeatedly (called \"rituals\"), or have certain thoughts repeatedly (called \"obsessions\"). People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time. Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out. These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected. This often takes up more than an hour a day. Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense. The condition is associated with tics, anxiety disorder, and an increased risk of suicide. The cause is unknown. There appear to be some genetic components with both identical twins more often affected than both non-identical twins. Risk factors include a history of child abuse or other stress-inducing event. Some cases have been documented to occur following infections. The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out other drug related or medical causes. Rating scales such as the Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity. Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, tic disorders, and obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder. Treatment involves counselling, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and sometimes antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine. CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to what causes the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur. While clomipramine appears to work as well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects so is typically reserved as a second line treatment. Atypical antipsychotics may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects. Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades. Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life. Rates during a given year are about 1.2%, and it occurs worldwide. It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of 35, and half of people develop problems before 20. Males and females are affected about equally. In English, the phrase \"obsessive\u2013compulsive\" is often used in an informal manner unrelated to OCD to describe someone who is excessively meticulous, perfectionistic, absorbed, or otherwise fixated. OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings. A meta analytic review of symptom structures found a four factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable. The observed groups included a \"symmetry factor\", a \"forbidden thoughts factor\", a \"cleaning factor\", and a \"hoarding factor\". The \"symmetry factor\" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions. The \"forbidden thoughts factor\" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The \"cleaning factor\" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The \"hoarding factor\" only involved hoarding related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.",

For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of coping with the heightened levels of anxiety), but drug addiction among people with OCD may serve as a type of compulsive behavior and not just as a coping mechanism. Depression is also extremely prevalent among people with OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other anxiety disorder) may feel depressed because of an \"out of control\" type of feeling.",

She writes that she had a bad habit of using drugs. She was a consistent user until one evening she had a terrible experience. She decided that drugs were not for her and she felt that God had chosen another path for her. Once she stopped using drugs she developed \"extreme and intrusive neurotic thoughts.\" Colas' condition is not uncommon in college students. OCD affects 5 of every 1,000 students. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a biological anxiety disorder that causes a person to obsess over worries or fears and perform rituals in order to satisfy the worries. For many people Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder first surfaces during their college career. This is because individuals with the disorder may have had more control over their condition while living at home with a family. Symptoms may not have interfered with the person's life or the person may have merely been labeled a perfectionist. Stress and adjusting to a new environment does not cause OCD, it does however provide an opportunity for symptoms to emerge. Emily Colas writes of the difficulty she faced in college due to her disorder. She struggled socially, as she began dating. Colas had developed a fear of eating at restaurants because she worried she would be poisoned. Fears like this are common among people with OCD. There are many different steps a college student can take to deal with their disorder. University health centers are available on most campuses and help can be provided to those who think they may have OCD. Cognitive behavior therapy accompanied by medication is the most common treatment for the disorder. Cognitive behavior therapists work with OCD patients to overcome their fears by talking them through the process of facing their fears. This method of treatment has proven to be the most effective. Although this method is extremely effective, patients should also stay away from certain over-the-counter drugs and caffeine. Meditation is also a healthy choice because it has a calming effect. Colas' condition was not uncommon for college students and today there are several places for students to go to get help.",

The Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI) is a behavioral rating checklist created by Dr. Kenneth Gadow and Dr. Joyce Sprafkin that assesses a range of behaviors related to common emotional and behavior disorders identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, major depressive episode, mania, dysthymic disorder (now pervasive depressive disorder in DSM-5), schizophrenia, autistic spectrum disorder, anorexia, and bulimia. In addition, one or two key symptoms of each of the following disorders are also included: obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, panic attack, motor tics, vocal tics, and substance use. CASI combines the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) and the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI), letting it apply to both children and adolescents ages 5 to 18. The CASI is a self-report questionnaire completed by the child's caregiver or teacher to detect signs of psychiatric disorders in multiple settings. Compared to other widely used checklists for youths, the CASI maps more closely to DSM diagnoses, with scoring systems that map to the diagnostic criteria as well as providing a severity score. Other measures are more likely to have used statistical methods, such as factor analysis, to group symptoms that often occur together; if they have DSM-oriented scales, they are often later additions that only include some of the diagnostic criteria. It is not yet clear scientifically whether a statistical or DSM-oriented approach is more useful at a clinical level. The CASI provides a low burden way of gathering a lot of information quickly about common problems, helping the clinician and family decide where to focus attention during interviews and treatment.",

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a unique mental disorder that cannot be fully cured. It can be controlled and understood, and one possible way of better doing that might be through studying CCD in canines. Studying dogs that exhibit compulsive behaviors has led scientists to genetic breakthroughs in understanding more how biology and genetics factor into Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. By observing and studying how CCD manifests in the brain activity, behaviors, and genes of diagnosed canines, scientists have been able to use their newfound information to develop better diagnostic tests and more readily recognize symptoms and susceptible humans. The similar brain functions and behaviors of dogs with CCD and humans with OCD suggests they have a connection, not only in behavior and symptoms, but in reacting to treatments. Understanding Canine Compulsive Disorder in dogs has helped scientists to better understand and apply their learning to developing new and more effective ways to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in humans.",

A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.",

For example, problems in producing dopamine can result in Parkinson's disease, a disorder that affects a person's ability to move as they want to, resulting in stiffness, tremors or shaking, and other symptoms. Some studies suggest that having too little or too much dopamine or problems using dopamine in the thinking and feeling regions of the brain may play a role in disorders like schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Similarly, after some research suggested that drugs that block the recycling, or reuptake, of serotonin seemed to help some people diagnosed with depression, it was theorized that people with depression might have lower-than-normal serotonin levels. Though widely popularized, this theory was not borne out in subsequent research. Furthermore, problems with producing or using glutamate have been suggestively and tentatively linked to many mental disorders, including autism, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and depression. Generally, there are no scientifically established \"norms\" for appropriate levels or \"balances\" of different neurotransmitters. It is in most cases pragmatically impossible to even measure levels of neurotransmitters in a brain or body at any distinct moments in time. Neurotransmitters regulate each other's release, and weak consistent imbalances in this mutual regulation were linked to temperament in healthy people  . Strong imbalances or disruptions to neurotransmitter systems have been associated with many diseases and mental disorders. These include Parkinson's, depression, insomnia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety, memory loss, dramatic changes in weight and addictions. Chronic physical or emotional stress can be a contributor to neurotransmitter system changes. Genetics also plays a role in neurotransmitter activities. Apart from recreational use, medications that directly and indirectly interact one or more transmitter or its receptor are commonly prescribed for psychiatric and psychological issues.

While there seems to be a ubiquitous understanding that neurochemical functioning is responsible for mediating the symptoms of OCD, recent psychopharmacologic studies have found that the serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system plays a particularly critical role. In comparison to healthy controls, the long-term administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found to be more effective than noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of OCD. For example, Rapoport \"et al.\" demonstrated that clomipramine was more effective than desipramine in decreasing several types of repetitive behavior. Research has also shown that the administration of 5-HT antagonists often exacerbates symptoms of OCD. If this were to be true, one would expect mirtazapine (which among others is a 5-HT receptor antagonist) and atypical antipsychotics that also have antagonistic effects at this receptor to attenuate the effect of SSRIs. Clinical studies with these drugs, however, have shown the opposite. Mirtazapine, although not effective by itself, has been shown to hasten the effect of paroxetine (Pallanti \"et al.,\" 2004), and several studies have shown that atypical antipsychotics augment the effects of SSRIs in refractory OCD patients (Bloch \"et al.,\" 2006). While these findings do not provide an explicit cause, they do set the stage for the notion that psychiatric conditions can be dissected pharmacologically.

            "document": "Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder . Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform certain routines repeatedly (called \"rituals\"), or have certain thoughts repeatedly (called \"obsessions\"). People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time. Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out. These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected. This often takes up more than an hour a day. Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense. The condition is associated with tics, anxiety disorder, and an increased risk of suicide. The cause is unknown. There appear to be some genetic components with both identical twins more often affected than both non-identical twins. Risk factors include a history of child abuse or other stress-inducing event. Some cases have been documented to occur following infections. The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out other drug related or medical causes. Rating scales such as the Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity. Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, tic disorders, and obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder. Treatment involves counselling, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and sometimes antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine. CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to what causes the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur. While clomipramine appears to work as well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects so is typically reserved as a second line treatment. Atypical antipsychotics may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects. Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades. Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life. Rates during a given year are about 1.2%, and it occurs worldwide. It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of 35, and half of people develop problems before 20. Males and females are affected about equally. In English, the phrase \"obsessive\u2013compulsive\" is often used in an informal manner unrelated to OCD to describe someone who is excessively meticulous, perfectionistic, absorbed, or otherwise fixated. OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings. A meta analytic review of symptom structures found a four factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable. The observed groups included a \"symmetry factor\", a \"forbidden thoughts factor\", a \"cleaning factor\", and a \"hoarding factor\". The \"symmetry factor\" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions. The \"forbidden thoughts factor\" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The \"cleaning factor\" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The \"hoarding factor\" only involved hoarding related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.",

Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a biological anxiety disorder that causes a person to obsess over worries or fears and perform rituals in order to satisfy the worries.

This is because individuals with the disorder may have had more control over their condition while living at home with a family. Symptoms may not have interfered with the person's life or the person may have merely been labeled a perfectionist. Stress and adjusting to a new environment does not cause OCD, it does however provide an opportunity for symptoms to emerge. Emily Colas writes of the difficulty she faced in college due to her disorder. She struggled socially, as she began dating. Colas had developed a fear of eating at restaurants because she worried she would be poisoned. Fears like this are common among people with OCD. There are many different steps a college student can take to deal with their disorder. University health centers are available on most campuses and help can be provided to those who think they may have OCD. Cognitive behavior therapy accompanied by medication is the most common treatment for the disorder. Cognitive behavior therapists work with OCD patients to overcome their fears by talking them through the process of facing their fears. This method of treatment has proven to be the most effective. Although this method is extremely effective, patients should also stay away from certain over-the-counter drugs and caffeine. Meditation is also a healthy choice because it has a calming effect.

While there seems to be a ubiquitous understanding that neurochemical functioning is responsible for mediating the symptoms of OCD, recent psychopharmacologic studies have found that the serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system plays a particularly critical role. In comparison to healthy controls, the long-term administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found to be more effective than noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of OCD. For example, Rapoport \"et al.\" demonstrated that clomipramine was more effective than desipramine in decreasing several types of repetitive behavior. Research has also shown that the administration of 5-HT antagonists often exacerbates symptoms of OCD. If this were to be true, one would expect mirtazapine (which among others is a 5-HT receptor antagonist) and atypical antipsychotics that also have antagonistic effects at this receptor to attenuate the effect of SSRIs. Clinical studies with these drugs, however, have shown the opposite. Mirtazapine, although not effective by itself, has been shown to hasten the effect of paroxetine (Pallanti \"et al.,\" 2004), and several studies have shown that atypical antipsychotics augment the effects of SSRIs in refractory OCD patients (Bloch \"et al.,\" 2006). While these findings do not provide an explicit cause, they do set the stage for the notion that psychiatric conditions can be dissected pharmacologically. Thus, the efficacy in controlling obsessions and compulsions with SSRIs suggests that OCD has an underlying neurochemical etiology.",

As noted in current medical literature reviews, compulsive sexual behavior has been observed in humans;drug-induced compulsive sexual behavior has also been noted clinically in some individuals taking dopaminergic drugs. Moreover, some research suggests compulsive engagement in sexual behavior despite negative consequences in animal models.Since current diagnostic models use drug-related concepts as diagnostic criteria for addictions, these are ill-suited for modelling compulsive behaviors in a clinical setting. Consequently, diagnostic classification systems, such as the DSM, do not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis because there is currently \"insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders\". A 2014 systematic review on sexual addiction indicated that the \"lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\" There have been debates regarding the definition and existence of sexual addictions for decades, as the issue was covered in a 1994 journal article. The [[Mayo Clinic]] considers sexual addiction a form of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] and refer to it as \"sexual compulsivity\" (note that by definition, an addiction is a compulsion toward rewarding stimuli). A paper dating back to 1988 and a journal comment letter published in 2006 asserted that sex addiction is itself a myth, a by-product of cultural and other influences. The 1988 paper argued that the condition is instead a way of projecting [[social stigma]] onto patients.",

Cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves exposure and response prevention (ERP), is the psychosocial treatment of choice for obsessive\u2010compulsive disorder. Despite this, ERP is not widely used by mental health practitioners. ERP means a person would repeatedly approach or is \"exposed to\" the very thing/object that makes that individual anxious or uncomfortable. Afterwards, the individual would attempt to stop oneself from engaging in behaviors that are designed to lower that anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, in contrast to traditional psychotherapy or \"talk\" therapy, is shorter in duration and focuses not so much on early life experiences or unconscious processes, but rather on \"here and now\" problems, and on the education and coaching of clients as they learn new ways of thinking and behaving in order to solve those problems. OCD or anxiety-producing intrusive thoughts or images, are normally followed by compulsions, or by behaviors that the individual does on purpose to lower anxiety. This is displayed by the forming thoughts such as \"that thing is dirty or contaminated\". Thereafter, the compulsion would be to avoid touching that certain object or thing, and it can also lead to excessive washing if the individual has touched it. The role ERP has in this matter would be to purposely have the individual touch \"contaminated\" things on purpose and have exposure to it. During ERP, with repeated \"exposure trials\", the person then \"learns\" to let go of the fear through a process called desensitization. In hopes of exposing the individual repeatedly to feared thoughts, things or situations over and over, it would become less of a bother or fear and essentially the individual would get accustomed to it. As this process is initially a scary process to OCD patients, they are either exposed gradually or quickly, in order to be able to handle their obsessive-compulsive behaviors allowing them to feel control of it.",

A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders. Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional. The causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context. A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis. Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers, using various methods such as psychometric tests but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options. Other treatments include social interventions, peer support, and self-help. In a minority of cases there might be involuntary detention or treatment. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression. Common mental disorders include depression, which affects about 400 million, dementia which affects about 35 million, and schizophrenia, which affects about 21 million people globally. Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion.  The definition and classification of mental disorders are key issues for researchers as well as service providers and those who may be diagnosed. For a mental state to classify as a disorder, it generally needs to cause dysfunction. Most international clinical documents use the term mental \"disorder\", while \"illness\" is also common. It has been noted that using the term \"mental\" (i.e., of the mind) is not necessarily meant to imply separateness from brain or body.",
