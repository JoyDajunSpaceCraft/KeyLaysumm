Researchers were curious to know if present day humans originated from Africa, or if they somehow, through anagenesis, were able to evolve from a single archaic species that lived in Afro-Eurasia. Milford H. Wolpoff is paleoanthropologist whose work done when studying human fossil records explored anagenesis as a hypothesis for hominin evolution. When looking at anagenesis in hominids, M. H. Wolpoff describes in terms of the \u2018single-species hypothesis,\u2019 which is characterized by thinking of the impact that culture has on a species as an adaptive system, and as an explanation to what conditions humans tend live in based on the environmental conditions, or ecological niche. When judging the effect culture has as this adaptive system, scientists must first look the modern Homo sapiens. Wolpoff contended that the ecological niche of past, extinct hominidae is distinct within the line of origin. Examining early Pliocene and late Miocenes findings helps to determine the corresponding importance of anagenesis vs. cladogenesis during the period of morphological differences. These findings propose that branches of the human and chimpanzee once diverged from each other. The hominin fossils go as far as 5 to 7 million years ago (Mya). Diversity on a species-level is able to be achieved through anagenesis. With collected data, only one or two early hominin were found to be relatively close to the Plio-Pleistocene range. Once more research was done, specifically with the fossils of \"A. anamensis\" and \"A. afarensis\", researchers were able to justify that these two hominin species were linked ancestrally. However, looking at data collected by William H. Kimbel and other researchers, they viewed the history of early hominin fossils and concluded that actual macroevolution change via anagenesis was scarce.",

This date confirmed Keith\u2019s ascribed Upper Palaeolithic age for the fossil, while also reinforcing then-current views on the dating and modern human associations of the Aurignacian industry in north-western Europe. However research conducted in the late 2000s identified problems with the accuracy of many 14C dates from the Middle to Upper Paleolithic, especially dates which were obtained during the early stages of the technique. The initial dating of KC4 was further scrutinized when traces of modern glue, which was used to repair the bone shortly after being discovered, were found to have contaminated the surface of the fossil. Due to this contamination additional testing of the fossil was determined to be necessary to confirm the date of the fossil. The bone did not contain enough uncontaminated surface area to re-date. This lack of adequate sample size was addressed when the research utilized the research archives from the Torquay Museum to obtain samples of other animal bones which had been excavate at Kent\u2019s Cavern. These bones were obtained from strata with recorded depths both above and below the spot where the maxilla was found. The bone, which included cave beer and woolly rhino obtained from close proximity to the maxilla, were then radiocarbon dated. All sampled bones where established as having dates from between 50,000 and 26,000 years old. By applying this information into a Bayesian statistical-modelling method, researchers were able to obtain an age for the maxilla that was between 44,000 and 41,000 years old.",

            "document": "Fossils of the Burgess Shale . Analysis of the Burgess Shale fossils has been important to the interpretation of the Precambrian and Cambrian fossil records, and thus to scientific understanding of the nature of early evolution. English geologist and palaeontologist William Buckland (1784\u20131856) realised that a dramatic change in the fossil record occurred around the start of the Cambrian period, . The earliest Cambrian trilobite fossils are about 530\u00a0million\u00a0years old, but were already both diverse and widespread, suggesting that the group had a long, hidden history. The earliest fossils widely accepted as echinoderms appeared at about the same time Because Darwin's contemporaries had insufficient information to establish relative dates of Cambrian rocks, they had the impression that animals appeared instantaneously. Charles Darwin regarded the solitary existence of Cambrian trilobites and total absence of other intermediate fossils as the \"gravest\" problem to his theory of natural selection, and he devoted an entire chapter of \"The Origin of Species\" on the matter. He speculated that the phenomenon, now known as the Cambrian explosion, was a product of gaps in the sequence of fossil-bearing rocks and in contemporary knowledge of those rocks. While some geological evidence was presented to suggest that earlier fossils did exist, for a long time this evidence was widely rejected. Fossils from the Ediacaran period, immediately preceding the Cambrian, were first found in 1868, but scientists at that time assumed there was no Precambrian life and therefore dismissed them as products of physical processes. Between 1883 and 1909 Walcott discovered other Precambrian fossils, which were accepted at the time. However, in 1931 Albert Charles Seward dismissed all claims to have found Precambrian fossils. In 1946, Reg Sprigg noticed \"jellyfishes\" in rocks from Australia's Ediacara Hills. However, while these are now recognized as coming from the Ediacaran period, they were thought at the time to have been formed in the Cambrian. From 1872 onwards small shelly fossils, none more than a few millimeters in size, were found in very Early Cambrian rocks, and later also found in rocks dating to the end of the preceding Ediacaran period, but scientists only started in the 1960s to recognize that these were left by a wide range of animals, some of which are now recognized as molluscs. Darwin's view \u2013 that gaps in the fossil record accounted for the apparently sudden appearance of diverse life forms \u2013 still had scientific support over a century later. In the early 1970s Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. However, Preston Cloud held a different view about the origins of complex life, writing in 1948 and 1968 that the evolution of animals in the Early Cambrian was \"explosive\". This \"explosive\" view was supported by the hypothesis of punctuated equilibrium, which Eldredge and Gould developed in the early 1970s\u2014which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis \"punctuated\" by short periods of rapid change.",

Workmen quarrying the Feldhofer Grotte in the Neander Valley, near D\u00fcsseldorf in northern Germany, in 1856 unearthed human bones in the floor of the cave. A local schoolmaster Johann Carl Fuhlrott, who was interested in geology and paleontology, learned of the discovery and went to the site to collect the unusual bones. They consisted of the top portion of a skull, a clavicle and scapula, the right and left ulnae, a radius bone, the left hip bone, and the right and left femora. Fuhlrott was immediately struck by the fact that the bones appeared to be completely fossilized and the geological location of the bones in the cave, both suggesting that the bones were extremely old. Fuhlrott, recognizing the possible scientific significance of the find, brought the bones to Schaaffhausen in Bonn for analysis. Schaaffhausen was impressed by the primitive form of the skull and the evidence for their geological antiquity. Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen presented papers on the fossils and the geology of the Feldhofer Cave at a meeting of the Niederrheinische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Natur- und Heilkunde (Lower Rhine Society for Natural History and Medical Studies) in Bonn in 1857. Schaaffhausen published a paper on the Neanderthal fossils in the \"Archiv f\u00fcr Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin\" in 1858 and Fuhlrott published a paper in the \"Verhandlungen des Naturhistorischen Vereins der preussischen Rheinlande und Westphalens\" in 1859 describing the geology of the site and how the bones were discovered. Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen believed the Neanderthal fossils dated from the Glacial Period when extinct animals such as mammoths and the wooly rhinoceros still lived in Europe, which would make them among the oldest human remains known. This was before scientists believed humans lived during the Ice Age. Furthermore, Schaaffhausen noted that the Neanderthal skull differed from modern human skulls. He argued that the prominent bony ridges over the eyes and the general shape of the skull indicated that it belonged to a savage and barbarous race of human. Schaaffhausen concluded that the bones belonged to the original wild race of humans that lived in Europe before modern European peoples migrated into Europe in prehistoric times. The fossils generated considerable debate among anthropologists in Germany and abroad. The prominent German anthropologist Rudolf Virchow rejected Schaaffhausen's interpretation of the fossils, considering them the pathological remains of an ancient human. However, in 1864 William King, professor of geology at Queens College in Galway, Ireland, presented a paper where he argued the Neanderthal fossils belonged to an extinct species of early human that he named \"Homo neanderthalensis\". Schaaffhausen continued to write on the Neanderthal fossils over the next two decades, comparing the bones with newly discovered Ice Age human fossils from Belgium, the Cro-magnon fossils from France, and Stone Age human bones from tombs across Europe.",

In November 1971, near the end of the first field season, Johanson noticed a fossil of the upper end of a shinbone, which had been sliced slightly at the front. The lower end of a femur was found near it, and when he fitted them together, the angle of the knee joint clearly showed that this fossil, reference AL 129-1, was an upright walking hominin.

Rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers, with each layer younger than the one underneath it. If a fossil is found between two layers whose ages are known, the fossil's age is claimed to lie between the two known ages. Because rock sequences are not continuous, but may be broken up by faults or periods of erosion, it is very difficult to match up rock beds that are not directly adjacent. However, fossils of species that survived for a relatively short time can be used to match isolated rocks: this technique is called \"biostratigraphy\". For instance, the conodont \"Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus\" has a short range in the Middle Ordovician period. If rocks of unknown age have traces of \"E. pseudoplanus\", they have a mid-Ordovician age. Such index fossils must be distinctive, be globally distributed and occupy a short time range to be useful. Misleading results are produced if the index fossils are incorrectly dated. Stratigraphy and biostratigraphy can in general provide only relative dating (\"A\" was before \"B\"), which is often sufficient for studying evolution. However, this is difficult for some time periods, because of the problems involved in matching rocks of the same age across continents. Family-tree relationships also help to narrow down the date when lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X\u00a0million years ago and the calculated \"family tree\" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved earlier.",

Researchers were curious to know if present day humans originated from Africa, or if they somehow, through anagenesis, were able to evolve from a single archaic species that lived in Afro-Eurasia. Milford H. Wolpoff is paleoanthropologist whose work done when studying human fossil records explored anagenesis as a hypothesis for hominin evolution. When looking at anagenesis in hominids, M. H. Wolpoff describes in terms of the \u2018single-species hypothesis,\u2019 which is characterized by thinking of the impact that culture has on a species as an adaptive system, and as an explanation to what conditions humans tend live in based on the environmental conditions, or ecological niche. When judging the effect culture has as this adaptive system, scientists must first look the modern Homo sapiens. Wolpoff contended that the ecological niche of past, extinct hominidae is distinct within the line of origin. Examining early Pliocene and late Miocenes findings helps to determine the corresponding importance of anagenesis vs. cladogenesis during the period of morphological differences. These findings propose that branches of the human and chimpanzee once diverged from each other. The hominin fossils go as far as 5 to 7 million years ago (Mya). Diversity on a species-level is able to be achieved through anagenesis. With collected data, only one or two early hominin were found to be relatively close to the Plio-Pleistocene range. Once more research was done, specifically with the fossils of \"A. anamensis\" and \"A. afarensis\", researchers were able to justify that these two hominin species were linked ancestrally.

White of the University of California also challenged the findings, asking, \"How can practitioners in this field possibly expect to be able to accurately identify fossil species based upon a few teeth, jaws, and lower faces in light of what we know about the great variation found among different individuals in a single living species?\" Leakey replied, \"I would challenge Tim to find any primate in which you would see the same degrees of variation as those that we are seeing between our new fossils and KNM-ER 1802\". KNM-ER 1802 is a lower-jaw fossil that is thought to be of a \"Homo rudolfensis\".

The idea that, along with other life forms, modern-day humans evolved from an ancient, common ancestor was proposed by Robert Chambers in 1844 and taken up by Charles Darwin in 1871. Modern humans evolved from a lineage of upright-walking apes that has been traced back over to \"Sahelanthropus\". The first known stone tools were made about , apparently by \"Australopithecus garhi\", and were found near animal bones that bear scratches made by these tools. The earliest hominines had chimpanzee-sized brains, but there has been a fourfold increase in the last 3\u00a0Ma; a statistical analysis suggests that hominine brain sizes depend almost completely on the date of the fossils, while the species to which they are assigned has only slight influence. There is a long-running debate about whether modern humans evolved all over the world simultaneously from existing advanced hominines or are descendants of a single small population in Africa, which then migrated all over the world less than 200,000\u00a0years ago and replaced previous hominine species. There is also debate about whether anatomically modern humans had an intellectual, cultural and technological \"Great Leap Forward\" under 100,000\u00a0years ago and, if so, whether this was due to neurological changes that are not visible in fossils. Life on Earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since . Although they were disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is \"superior\" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.",
