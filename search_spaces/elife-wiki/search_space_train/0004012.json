A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-\u03baB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.",

            "document": "NF-\u03baB . In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB), which are proteins that contain multiple copies of a sequence called ankyrin repeats. By virtue of their ankyrin repeat domains, the I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of NF-\u03baB proteins and keep them sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. I\u03baBs are a family of related proteins that have an N-terminal regulatory domain, followed by six or more ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain near their C terminus. Although the I\u03baB family consists of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and Bcl-3, the best-studied and major I\u03baB protein is I\u03baB\u03b1. Due to the presence of ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal halves, p105 and p100 also function as I\u03baB proteins. The c-terminal half of p100, that is often referred to as I\u03baB\u03b4, also functions as an inhibitor. I\u03baB\u03b4 degradation in response to developmental stimuli, such as those transduced through LT\u03b2R, potentiate NF-\u03baB dimer activation in a NIK dependent non-canonical pathway. Activation of the NF-\u03baB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of I\u03baB proteins. This occurs primarily via activation of a kinase called the I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits and a \"master\" regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) or IKK gamma. When activated by signals, usually coming from the outside of the cell, the I\u03baB kinase phosphorylates two serine residues located in an I\u03baB regulatory domain. When phosphorylated on these serines (e.g., serines 32 and 36 in human I\u03baB\u03b1), the I\u03baB proteins are modified by a process called ubiquitination, which then leads them to be degraded by a cell structure called the proteasome.  With the degradation of I\u03baB, the NF-\u03baB complex is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can 'turn on' the expression of specific genes that have DNA-binding sites for NF-\u03baB nearby. The activation of these genes by NF-\u03baB then leads to the given physiological response, for example, an inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, or cellular proliferation. Translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus can be detected immunocytochemically and measured by laser scanning cytometry. NF-\u03baB turns on expression of its own repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. The newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 then re-inhibits NF-\u03baB and, thus, forms an auto feedback loop, which results in oscillating levels of NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, several viruses, including the AIDS virus HIV, have binding sites for NF-\u03baB that controls the expression of viral genes, which in turn contribute to viral replication or viral pathogenicity. In the case of HIV-1, activation of NF-\u03baB may, at least in part, be involved in activation of the virus from a latent, inactive state. YopP is a factor secreted by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, that prevents the ubiquitination of I\u03baB. This causes this pathogen to effectively inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and thus block the immune response of a human infected with Yersinia.",

The main goal of biochemical cascades in lymphocytes is the secretion of molecules that can suppress altered cells or eliminate pathogenic agents, through proliferation, differentiation and activation of these cells. Therefore, the antigenic receptors play a central role in signal transduction in lymphocytes, because when antigens interact with them lead to a cascade of signal events. These receptors, that recognize the antigen soluble (B cells) or linked to a molecule on Antigen Presenting Cells (T cells), don't have long cytoplasm tails, so they are anchored to signal proteins, which contain a long cytoplasmic tails with a motif that can be phosphorylated (ITAM \u2013 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and resulting in different signal pathways. The antigen receptor and signal protein form a stable complex, named BCR or TCR, in B or T cells, respectively. The family Src is essential for signal transduction in these cells, because it's responsible for phosphorylation of ITAMs. Therefore, Lyn and Lck, in lymphocytes B and T, respectively, phosphorylate ITAMs after the antigen recognition and the conformational change of the receptor, which leads to the binding of Syk/Zap-70 kinases to ITAM and its activation. Syk kinase is specific of lymphocytes B and Zap-70 is present in T cells. After activation of these enzymes, some adaptor proteins are phosphorylated, like BLNK (B cells) and LAT (T cells). These proteins after phosphorylation become activated and allow binding of others enzymes that continue the biochemical cascade. One example of a protein that binds to adaptor proteins and become activated is PLC that is very important in the lymphocyte signal pathways. PLC is responsible for PKC activation, via DAG and Ca, which leads to phosphorylation of CARMA1 molecule, and formation of CBM complex. This complex activates I\u03ba\u03ba kinase, which phosphorylates I-\u03baB, and then allows the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and transcription of genes encoding cytokines, for example. Others transcriptional factors like NFAT and AP1 complex are also important for transcription of cytokines. The differentiation of B cells to plasma cells is also an example of a signal mechanism in lymphocytes, induced by a cytokine receptor. In this case, some interleukins bind to a specific receptor, which leads to activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. Consequently, the BLIMP1 protein is translated and inhibits PAX5, allowing immunoglobulin genes transcription and activation of XBP1 (important for the secretory apparatus formation and enhancing of protein synthesis). Also, the coreceptors (CD28/CD19) play an important role because they can improve the antigen/receptor binding and initiate parallel cascade events, like activation o PI3 Kinase. PIP3 then is responsible for activation of several proteins, like vav (leads to activation of JNK pathway, which consequently leads to activation of c-Jun) and btk (can also activate PLC).",

If the cells, under normal circumstances, don\u2019t divide when their genetic information is damaged, but will enter mitosis if endogenous cyclin B is expressed in the nucleus, it is likely that the translocation of the cyclin B to the cytoplasm is a mechanism that prevents immature mitotic entry.

            "document": "Therapeutic index . Radiotherapy aims to minimize the size of tumors and kill cancer cells with high energy. The source of high energy arises from x-rays, gamma rays, charged particles and heavy particles. The therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy for cancer treatment is related to the maximum radiation dose by which death of cancer cells is locally controlled and the minimum radiation dose by which cells in normal tissues have low acute and late morbidity. Both of parameters have sigmoidal dose-response curves. Thus, a favorable outcome in dose-response curve is the response of tumor tissue is greater than that of normal tissue to the same dose, meaning that the treatment is effective to tumors and does not cause serious morbidity to normal tissue. Reversely, overlapping response of two tissues is highly likely to cause serious morbidity to normal tissue and ineffective treatment to tumors. The mechanism of radiation therapy is categorized into direct and indirect radiation. Both of direct and indirect radiations induce DNAs to have a mutation or chromosomal rearrangement during its repair process. Direct radiation creates a free DNA radical from radiation energy deposition that damages DNA. Indirect radiation occurs from radiolysis of water, creating a free hydroxyl radical, hydronium and electron. Then, hydroxyl radical transfers its radical to DNA. Or together with hydronium and electron, a free hydroxyl radical can damage base region of DNA. Cancer cells have imbalance of signals in cell cycle. G1 and G2/M arrest are found to be major checkpoints by irradiation in human cells. G1 arrest delays repair mechanism before synthesis of DNA in S phase and mitosis in M phase, suggesting key checkpoint to lead survival of cells. G2/M arrest occurs when cells need to repair after S phase before the mitotic entry. It was also known that S phase is the most resistant to radiation and M phase was the most sensitive to radiation. p53, a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in G1 and G2/M arrest, enabled the understanding of the cell cycle by radiation. For example, irradiation to myeloid leukemia cell leads to an increase in p53 and a decrease in the level of DNA synthesis. Patients with Ataxia telangiectasia delays have hypersensitivity to radiation due to the delay of accumulation of p53. In this case, cells are able to replicate without repair of their DNA, prone to incidence of cancer. Most cells are in G1 and S phase and irradiation at G2 phase showed increased radiosensitivity and thus G1 arrest has been on focus for therapeutic treatment. Irradiation to a tissue creates response to both irradiated and non-irridiated cells. It was found that even cells up to 50-75 cell diameter distant from irradiated cells have phenotype of enhanced genetic instability such as micronucleation. This suggests the effect of cell-to-cell communication such as paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Normal cells do not lose DNA repair mechanism whereas cancer cells often lose during radiotherapy. However, the nature of high energy radiation can override the ability of damaged normal cell to repair, leading to cause another risk for carcinogenesis. This suggests a significant risk associated with radiation therapy. Thus, it is desirable to improve the therapeutic ratio during radiotherapy. Employing IG-IMRT, protons and heavy ions are likely to minimize dose to normal tissues by altered fractionation. Molecular targeting to DNA repair pathway can lead to radiosensitization or radioprotection. Examples are direct and indirect inhibitors on DNA double-strand breaks. Direct inhibitors target proteins (PARP family) and kinases (ATM, DNA-PKCs) that are involved in DNA repair. Indirect inhibitors target proteins tumor cell signaling proteins such as EGFR and insulin growth factor.",

Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell. Cells and tissues can vary in competence, their ability to respond to external signals.",

In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB), which are proteins that contain multiple copies of a sequence called ankyrin repeats. By virtue of their ankyrin repeat domains, the I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of NF-\u03baB proteins and keep them sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. I\u03baBs are a family of related proteins that have an N-terminal regulatory domain, followed by six or more ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain near their C terminus. Although the I\u03baB family consists of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and Bcl-3, the best-studied and major I\u03baB protein is I\u03baB\u03b1. Due to the presence of ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal halves, p105 and p100 also function as I\u03baB proteins. The c-terminal half of p100, that is often referred to as I\u03baB\u03b4, also functions as an inhibitor. I\u03baB\u03b4 degradation in response to developmental stimuli, such as those transduced through LT\u03b2R, potentiate NF-\u03baB dimer activation in a NIK dependent non-canonical pathway. Activation of the NF-\u03baB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of I\u03baB proteins. This occurs primarily via activation of a kinase called the I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits and a \"master\" regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) or IKK gamma. When activated by signals, usually coming from the outside of the cell, the I\u03baB kinase phosphorylates two serine residues located in an I\u03baB regulatory domain. When phosphorylated on these serines (e.g., serines 32 and 36 in human I\u03baB\u03b1), the I\u03baB proteins are modified by a process called ubiquitination, which then leads them to be degraded by a cell structure called the proteasome.  With the degradation of I\u03baB, the NF-\u03baB complex is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can 'turn on' the expression of specific genes that have DNA-binding sites for NF-\u03baB nearby. The activation of these genes by NF-\u03baB then leads to the given physiological response, for example, an inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, or cellular proliferation. Translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus can be detected immunocytochemically and measured by laser scanning cytometry. NF-\u03baB turns on expression of its own repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. The newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 then re-inhibits NF-\u03baB and, thus, forms an auto feedback loop, which results in oscillating levels of NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, several viruses, including the AIDS virus HIV, have binding sites for NF-\u03baB that controls the expression of viral genes, which in turn contribute to viral replication or viral pathogenicity. In the case of HIV-1, activation of NF-\u03baB may, at least in part, be involved in activation of the virus from a latent, inactive state. YopP is a factor secreted by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, that prevents the ubiquitination of I\u03baB. This causes this pathogen to effectively inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and thus block the immune response of a human infected with Yersinia.",

Because NF-\u03baB controls many genes involved in inflammation, it is not surprising that NF-\u03baB is found to be chronically active in many inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, sepsis, gastritis, asthma, atherosclerosis and others. It is important to note though, that elevation of some NF-\u03baB activators, such as osteoprotegerin (OPG), are associated with elevated mortality, especially from cardiovascular diseases. Elevated NF-\u03baB has also been associated with schizophrenia. Recently, NF-\u03baB activation has been suggested as a possible molecular mechanism for the catabolic effects of cigarette smoke in skeletal muscle and sarcopenia. Research has shown that during inflammation the function of a cell depends on signals it activates in response to contact with adjacent cells and to combinations of hormones, especially cytokines that act on it through specific receptors. A cells\u2019 phenotype within a tissue develops through mutual stimulation of feedback signals that coordinate its function with other cells; this is especially evident during reprogramming of cell function when a tissue is exposed to inflammation, because cells alter their phenotype, and gradually express combinations of genes that prepare the tissue for regeneration after the cause of inflammation is removed. Particularly important are feedback responses that develop between tissue resident cells, and circulating cells of the immune system. Fidelity of feedback responses between diverse cell types and the immune system depends on the integrity of mechanisms that limit the range of genes activated by NF-\u03baB, allowing only expression of genes which contribute to an effective immune response and subsequently, a complete restoration of tissue function after resolution of inflammation. In cancer, mechanisms that regulate gene expression in response to inflammatory stimuli are altered to the point that a cell ceases to link its survival with the mechanisms that coordinate its phenotype and its function with the rest of the tissue. This is often evident in severely compromised regulation of NF-\u03baB activity, which allows cancer cells to express abnormal cohorts of NF-\u03baB target genes. This results in not only the cancer cells functioning abnormally: cells of surrounding tissue alter their function and cease to support the organism exclusively. Additionally, several types of cells in the microenvironment of cancer may change their phenotypes to support cancer growth. Inflammation, therefore, is a process that tests the fidelity of tissue components because the process that leads to tissue regeneration requires coordination of gene expression between diverse cell types.",

NBD is a peptide that acts by binding to regulatory subunit NEMO (IKK-\u03b3) thereby preventing it from binding subunits IKK-\u03b1 and IKK-\u03b2 and activating the IKK complex. In the absence of regulatory subunit IKK-\u03b3 the IKK complex is inactive, preventing the downstream signal transduction cascade leading to NF-\u03baB activation. Binding of IKK-\u03b3 to IKK-\u03b1 and IKK-\u03b2 subunits activates the IKK complex leading to phosphorylation of I\u03baB kinase, I\u03baB\u03b1, and release of NF-\u03baB dimers p105 and RELA to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of NF-\u03baB responsive genes. In the presence of the NBD peptide, the IKK complex remains inactive and I\u03baB\u03b1 sequesters NF-\u03baB dimers in the cytoplasm inhibiting transcription of NF-\u03baB responsive genes. While NF-\u03baB inhibitory drugs have previously been attractive to disease such as chronic inflammation and diabetes, specific cancers have been shown to have constitutive NF-\u03baB activity. Advanced B-cell lymphoma (ABC), a subtype of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been shown to have fundamental and upregulated NF-\u03baB activity. ABC lymphoma also has the lowest survival rate compared to DLBCL subtypes, Germinal Center B-cell-like and Undefined Type 3 lymphoma, highlighting the great clinical need to define targets for cancer therapy. Notably, the NBD peptide targets the inflammation induced NF-\u03baB activation pathway sparing the protective functions of basal NF-\u03baB activity allowing for greater therapeutic value and fewer undesired side effects.",

The airway epithelium together with alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells play a major role in the initial recognition of bacterial products getting into the lower airways with the air. Since some of these products are potent proinflammatory stimuli it is extremely important for the immune system to distinguish between pathogens and non-pathogenic commensals. This prevents the development of constant inflammation and forms tolerance against harmless microbiota.  This process becomes much more intriguing when taking into account that commensals often share their surface molecules with pathogens. Epithelial cells are equipped with very sensitive recognition tools - toll like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) which recognize a broad variety of microbial structural components. After recognition of pathogenic bacteria proinflammatory pathways are activated and cellular components of the adaptive and innate immunity are recruited to the infection site. One key regulator in this process is the NF-\u03baB which translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and activates pro-inflammatory genes in epithelial cells and macrophages. The DNA-binding protein complex recognizes a discrete nucleotide sequence (5\u2019-GGG ACT TTC T-3\u2019) in the upstream region of a variety of response genes.

In this pathway, activation of the NF-\u03baB inducing kinase (NIK) upon receptor ligation led to the phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal processing of the NF-\u03baB2 precursor protein p100 into mature p52 subunit in an IKK1/IKKa dependent manner. Then p52 dimerizes with RelB to appear as a nuclear RelB:p52 DNA binding activity and regulate a distinct class of genes. In contrast to the canonical signaling that relies upon NEMO-IKK2 mediated degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b5, the non-canonical signaling critically depends on NIK mediated processing of p100 into p52. Given their distinct regulations, these two pathways were thought to be independent of each other. However, recent analyses revealed that synthesis of the constituents of the non-canonical pathway, viz RelB and p52, is controlled by the canonical IKK2-I\u03baB-RelA:p50 signaling. Moreover, generation of the canonical and non-canonical dimers, viz RelA:p50 and RelB:p52, within the cellular milieu are also mechanistically interlinked.

            "document": "Biochemical cascade . The main goal of biochemical cascades in lymphocytes is the secretion of molecules that can suppress altered cells or eliminate pathogenic agents, through proliferation, differentiation and activation of these cells. Therefore, the antigenic receptors play a central role in signal transduction in lymphocytes, because when antigens interact with them lead to a cascade of signal events. These receptors, that recognize the antigen soluble (B cells) or linked to a molecule on Antigen Presenting Cells (T cells), don't have long cytoplasm tails, so they are anchored to signal proteins, which contain a long cytoplasmic tails with a motif that can be phosphorylated (ITAM \u2013 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and resulting in different signal pathways. The antigen receptor and signal protein form a stable complex, named BCR or TCR, in B or T cells, respectively. The family Src is essential for signal transduction in these cells, because it's responsible for phosphorylation of ITAMs. Therefore, Lyn and Lck, in lymphocytes B and T, respectively, phosphorylate ITAMs after the antigen recognition and the conformational change of the receptor, which leads to the binding of Syk/Zap-70 kinases to ITAM and its activation. Syk kinase is specific of lymphocytes B and Zap-70 is present in T cells. After activation of these enzymes, some adaptor proteins are phosphorylated, like BLNK (B cells) and LAT (T cells). These proteins after phosphorylation become activated and allow binding of others enzymes that continue the biochemical cascade. One example of a protein that binds to adaptor proteins and become activated is PLC that is very important in the lymphocyte signal pathways. PLC is responsible for PKC activation, via DAG and Ca, which leads to phosphorylation of CARMA1 molecule, and formation of CBM complex. This complex activates I\u03ba\u03ba kinase, which phosphorylates I-\u03baB, and then allows the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and transcription of genes encoding cytokines, for example. Others transcriptional factors like NFAT and AP1 complex are also important for transcription of cytokines. The differentiation of B cells to plasma cells is also an example of a signal mechanism in lymphocytes, induced by a cytokine receptor. In this case, some interleukins bind to a specific receptor, which leads to activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. Consequently, the BLIMP1 protein is translated and inhibits PAX5, allowing immunoglobulin genes transcription and activation of XBP1 (important for the secretory apparatus formation and enhancing of protein synthesis). Also, the coreceptors (CD28/CD19) play an important role because they can improve the antigen/receptor binding and initiate parallel cascade events, like activation o PI3 Kinase. PIP3 then is responsible for activation of several proteins, like vav (leads to activation of JNK pathway, which consequently leads to activation of c-Jun) and btk (can also activate PLC).",

These cells exhibit a potent phagocytic activity that ensures the proper function of the retina. Therefore, oxidative stress can potentially damage the RPE cells and cause vision impairment. Studies in human RPE cells have suggested that the presence of oxidative stress triggering molecules, such as HO causes the fragmentation of the DNA that in turn triggers apoptosis. These studies have proposed that PD1 acts as a signaling molecule and through its ligand-receptor interaction down-regulates the expression of genes, such as the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. The inhibition of NF-\u03baB results in the down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory gene COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) which is responsible for the release of prostaglandins, a potent pro-inflammatory mediator. In addition, PD1 has an important role in regulating the expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bax and Bad) that precedes the release of the cytochrome c complex from the mitochondria and the formation of the apoptosome. The presence of PD1 up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, while it inhibits the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad. Specifically, PD1 regulates this protein family by promoting the dephosphorylation of Bcl-x by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at residue Ser-62 which in turn heterodimerizes with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and inactivates it. Consequently, the activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins results in the inhibition of the caspase 3 enzyme, thus preventing apoptosis and promoting RPE cell survival.",

When detached from surfaces, cultured non-malignant PWR-1E and PC3 prostate cancer cells die by engaging suicidal apoptosis pathways, a reaction termed anoikis. This is accompanied by increased expression of BLT2 receptors, activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), increases in NOX-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS-induced activation of the pro-survival transcription factor, NF-\u03baB. Ectopic expression and stimulation of BLT2 receptors by 12(\"S\")-HETE or a synthetic BLT2 receptor agonist, CAY-10583, inhibits whereas Gene knockdown by mRNA interference or pharmacological inhibition by LY255283 enhances these cells' anoikis response to surface detachment. Unlike PC-3 cells, LNCaP and CWR22rv-1 human prostate cancer cell lines require exogenous androgen for their survival; this mimics the androgen dependency exhibited by most human prostate cancers in their early, untreated stages. Both cell lines overexpress BLT2 receptors compared to the PWR-1E non-malignant human prostate cell line. Treatment with the BLT2 receptor antagonist, Ly255283, caused both cell lines to become apoptotic; furthermore, BLT2 receptor knockdown using interference mRNA caused LNCaP but not PWR-1E cell apoptosis. The effect appears due to the loss of BLT2-induced NOX4 generation, consequential reactive oxygen species-induced NF-\u03baB-activation, and NF-\u03baB-stimulated expression of androgen receptors. 12-HETE also increases the survival of PC-3 cells by helping to maintain high levels of phosphorylated Rb retinoblastoma protein, an effect which reduces the ability of retinoblastoma protein to inhibit the synthesis of DNA and thereby cell division.

Through combination of DNA damage and nuclear localization of exogenous cyclin B, they were able to determine that cells would divide even with DNA damage if the cyclin B were forced to be expressed in the nucleus. This suggests that spatial localization of cyclin B may play a role as a checkpoint of mitosis. If the cells, under normal circumstances, don\u2019t divide when their genetic information is damaged, but will enter mitosis if endogenous cyclin B is expressed in the nucleus, it is likely that the translocation of the cyclin B to the cytoplasm is a mechanism that prevents immature mitotic entry. This hypothesis was further supported by Jin et al.\u2019s analysis of cells arrested in G2 due to DNA damage. In these cells, Jin et al. observed high levels of cyclin B-Cdc2 complex activity in the cytoplasm. This is supporting evidence for the previously mentioned theory because it shows that the Cdc2 can activate the cyclin without immediate translocation to the nucleus.

Initially Chk1 was thought to function as a tumor suppressor due to the regulatory role it serves amongst cells with DNA damage. However, there has been no evidence of homozygous loss of function mutants for Chk1 in human tumors. Instead, Chk1 has been shown to be overexpressed in a numerous tumors including breast, colon, liver, gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. There is a positive correlation with Chk1 expression and tumor grade and disease recurrence suggesting Chk1 may promote tumor growth. Chk1 is essential for cell survival and through high levels of expressions in tumors the function may be inducing tumor cell proliferation. Further, a study has demonstrated that targeting CHK1 reactivates the tumour suppressive activity of protein phosphtase 2A (PP2A) complex in cancer cells. Studies have shown complete loss of Chk1 suppresses chemically induce carcinogenesis however Chk1 haploinsufficiency results in tumor progression. Due to the possibility of Chk1 involvement in tumor promotion, the kinase and related signaling molecules may be potentially effective therapeutic targets. Cancer therapies utilize DNA damaging therapies such as chemotherapies and ionizing radiation to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest. Tumor cells with increased levels of Chk1 acquire survival advantages due to the ability to tolerate a higher level of DNA damage. Therefore, Chk1 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. In order to optimize chemotherapies, Chk1 must be inhibited to reduce the survival advantage. Chk1 gene can be effectively silenced by siRNA knockdown for further analysis based on an independent validation. By inhibiting Chk1, cancer cells lose the ability to repair damaged DNA which allows chemotherapeutic agents to work more effectively. Combining DNA damaging therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation treatment with Chk1 inhibition enhances targeted cell death and provides synthetic lethality. Many cancers rely on Chk1 mediated cell cycle arrest heavily especially if cancers are deficient in p53. Approximately 50% of cancers possess p53 mutations illustrating the dependence that many cancers may have on the Chk1 pathway. Inhibition of Chk1 allows selective targeting of p53 mutant cells as Chk1 levels are more likely to highly expressed in tumor cells with p53 deficiencies. Even though this method of inhibition is highly targeted, recent research has shown Chk1 also has a role in the normal cell cycle. Therefore, off-target effects and toxicity associated with combination therapies using CHk1 inhibitors must be considered during development of novel therapies.",

            "document": "Chemotherapy . Resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as p-glycoprotein, in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on p-glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of p-glycoprotein are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult. Another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification, a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.",

Some miRNAs also undergo methylation-associated silencing in cancer cells. Let-7 and miR15/16 play important roles in down-regulating RAS and BCL2 oncogenes, and their silencing occurs in cancer cells. Decreased expression of miR-125b1, a miRNA that functions as a tumor suppressor, was observed in prostate, ovarian, breast and glial cell cancers. In vitro experiments have shown that miR-125b1 targets two genes, HER2/neu and ESR1, that are linked to breast cancer. DNA methylation, specifically hypermethylation, is one of the main ways that the miR-125b1 is epigenetically silenced. In patients with breast cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands located proximal to the transcription start site was observed. Loss of CTCF binding and an increase in repressive histone marks, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, correlates with DNA methylation and miR-125b1 silencing. Mechanistically, CTCF may function as a boundary element to stop the spread of DNA methylation. Results from experiments conducted by Soto-Reyes et al. indicate a negative effect of methylation on the function and expression of miR-125b1. Therefore, they concluded that DNA methylation has a part in silencing the gene. Furthermore, some miRNA's are epigenetically silenced early on in breast cancer, and therefore these miRNA's could potentially be useful as tumor markers. The epigenetic silencing of miRNA genes by aberrant DNA methylation is a frequent event in cancer cells; almost one third of miRNA promoters active in normal mammary cells were found hypermethylated in breast cancer cells - that is a several fold greater proportion than is usually observed for protein coding genes.  DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms).",

Bacterially induced ROS causes oxidative inactivation of the catalytic cysteine residue of Ub 12 resulting in incomplete but transient loss of cullin-1 neddylation and consequent effects on NF-\u03baB and \u03b2-catenin signaling. Another commensal species, \"B. thetaiotaomicron\", attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by promoting nuclear export of NF-\u03baB subunit RelA, through a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3)-dependent pathway. PPAR-\u03b3 target transcriptionally active Rel A and induce early nuclear clearance limiting the duration of NF-\u03baB action.",

            "document": "Therapeutic index . Radiotherapy aims to minimize the size of tumors and kill cancer cells with high energy. The source of high energy arises from x-rays, gamma rays, charged particles and heavy particles. The therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy for cancer treatment is related to the maximum radiation dose by which death of cancer cells is locally controlled and the minimum radiation dose by which cells in normal tissues have low acute and late morbidity. Both of parameters have sigmoidal dose-response curves. Thus, a favorable outcome in dose-response curve is the response of tumor tissue is greater than that of normal tissue to the same dose, meaning that the treatment is effective to tumors and does not cause serious morbidity to normal tissue. Reversely, overlapping response of two tissues is highly likely to cause serious morbidity to normal tissue and ineffective treatment to tumors. The mechanism of radiation therapy is categorized into direct and indirect radiation. Both of direct and indirect radiations induce DNAs to have a mutation or chromosomal rearrangement during its repair process. Direct radiation creates a free DNA radical from radiation energy deposition that damages DNA. Indirect radiation occurs from radiolysis of water, creating a free hydroxyl radical, hydronium and electron. Then, hydroxyl radical transfers its radical to DNA. Or together with hydronium and electron, a free hydroxyl radical can damage base region of DNA. Cancer cells have imbalance of signals in cell cycle. G1 and G2/M arrest are found to be major checkpoints by irradiation in human cells. G1 arrest delays repair mechanism before synthesis of DNA in S phase and mitosis in M phase, suggesting key checkpoint to lead survival of cells. G2/M arrest occurs when cells need to repair after S phase before the mitotic entry. It was also known that S phase is the most resistant to radiation and M phase was the most sensitive to radiation. p53, a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in G1 and G2/M arrest, enabled the understanding of the cell cycle by radiation. For example, irradiation to myeloid leukemia cell leads to an increase in p53 and a decrease in the level of DNA synthesis. Patients with Ataxia telangiectasia delays have hypersensitivity to radiation due to the delay of accumulation of p53. In this case, cells are able to replicate without repair of their DNA, prone to incidence of cancer. Most cells are in G1 and S phase and irradiation at G2 phase showed increased radiosensitivity and thus G1 arrest has been on focus for therapeutic treatment. Irradiation to a tissue creates response to both irradiated and non-irridiated cells. It was found that even cells up to 50-75 cell diameter distant from irradiated cells have phenotype of enhanced genetic instability such as micronucleation. This suggests the effect of cell-to-cell communication such as paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Normal cells do not lose DNA repair mechanism whereas cancer cells often lose during radiotherapy. However, the nature of high energy radiation can override the ability of damaged normal cell to repair, leading to cause another risk for carcinogenesis. This suggests a significant risk associated with radiation therapy. Thus, it is desirable to improve the therapeutic ratio during radiotherapy. Employing IG-IMRT, protons and heavy ions are likely to minimize dose to normal tissues by altered fractionation. Molecular targeting to DNA repair pathway can lead to radiosensitization or radioprotection. Examples are direct and indirect inhibitors on DNA double-strand breaks. Direct inhibitors target proteins (PARP family) and kinases (ATM, DNA-PKCs) that are involved in DNA repair. Indirect inhibitors target proteins tumor cell signaling proteins such as EGFR and insulin growth factor.",

In tumor cells, NF-\u03baB is active (for example, in 41% of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma) either due to mutations in genes encoding the NF-\u03baB transcription factors themselves or in genes that control NF-\u03baB activity (such as I\u03baB genes); in addition, some tumor cells secrete factors that cause NF-\u03baB to become active. Blocking NF-\u03baB can cause tumor cells to stop proliferating, to die, or to become more sensitive to the action of anti-tumor agents. Thus, NF-\u03baB is the subject of much active research among pharmaceutical companies as a target for anti-cancer therapy.",

            "document": "TERF2 . Telomerase is an enzyme that works to create telomeric ends for DNA, and it is thought to play important roles in the development of cancer. Specifically, telomeric stability is known to be a common occurrence in cancer cells. Along with the telomerase, the shelterin complex, and TERF2 and TERF1 specifically, also have been noted to control the lengths of telomeres formed by these telomerases. Shelterin works to protect telomeres against unsuitable activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as noted in the function section above. TERF2 as part of the shelterin complex, has been known to block the ATM signaling pathways and prevent chromosome end fusion. In cancer cells, TERF2 phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) is a controlling factor in the major pro-oncogenic signaling pathways (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK) that affect telomeric stability. Additionally, when TERF2 was non-phosphorylated in melanoma cells, there was a cell induced DNA damage response, arresting growth and causing tumor reversion. Studies have found that in tumor cells, TERF2 levels are observed to be high, and this raised level of TERF2 contributes to oncogenesis in a variety of ways. This high level of TERF2 decreases the ability to recruit and activate natural killer cells in human tumor cells. One study used a dominant negative form of TERF2, to inhibit TERF2, and found that it could induce a reversion malignant phenotype in human melanoma cells. Therefore, over-expression of TERF2, and therefore blocking of TERF2, induced apoptosis and reduced tumourigenicity in certain cell lines. Additionally, upregulation of TERF2 may be the cause of the establishment and maintenance of short telomeres. These short telomeres increase chromosomal instability, and increase the chances of certain cancers progressing in the body, such as with leukemia. In gastric mucosa tissues, the expression of TERF2 proteins was significantly higher than normal, and this over-expression of TERF2, along with over-expression of TERF1, TIN2, TERT, and BRCA1 protein transposition, may cause a reduction in telomere length, further contributing to multistage carcinogenesis of gastric cancer.",

            "document": "Apoptosis . A recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460. The \"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein\" (XIAP) is overexpressed in cells of the H460 cell line. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator cytochrome c, therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of proapoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die. Defects in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells occur often at the level of control of transcription factors. As a particular example, defects in molecules that control transcription factor NF-\u03baB in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signals, to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belongs. This degree of independence from external survival signals, can enable cancer metastasis.",
