In this stage, an oogonium is fertilized by an antheridium. \"Pythium voultum\" is usually fertilized by one antheridium, but has been observed being fertilized by as many as four antheridia at a time, which is different from other \"Pythia spp.\" After fertilization, an oospore is produced. Oospores are resting structures that allow the pathogen to overwinter in the soil. Once the oospore is formed, the oospore will either begin to produce zoospores or begin to germinate and directly infect new plants itself. Because of this fact, the initial inoculum can be either considered the oospore itself or the zoospores that emerge from the oospore. Dissemination of these spores is reliant on water. Zoospores specifically use water to swim to the host. Once the infectious spores reach the host\u2019s root tissue, infection occurs. This infection is a systemic infection resulting in chlorosis, wilting, and ultimately plant death. Before plant death occurs, the infected plants produce structures called sporangia. Sporangia can then be disseminated by the wind, rain, or mechanical factors to reach new hosts. Once the sporangia reach a new, uninfected host, zoospores are released. These zoospores produced by the sporangia again use water and moisture to swim to openings or wounds in the bentgrass. This is different from the initial inoculum because these spores may enter through other plant structures than the root tissue. From this point, the infected plant will eventually die and the pathogen will again overwinter in the oospore structures. Infection of grass occurs in fall and spring. This is when soil temperatures and moisture levels are optimal for spores to infect the roots of plants.",

            "document": "Pecan scab . \"Fusicladium effusum\" over-winters in plant debris, such as shucks, leaf petioles and stems, as well as in lesions on the tree from the previous season. It survives as stromata, a tight mat of fungal material that lives within tissue. In the spring time, hyphae in the stromata germinate to produce solitary or loosely fasciculate conidiophores which produce conidia (asexual spores) in simple or branched chains. Conidia are dentical-like and have unthickened walls. Conidia are moved by wind and water to a susceptible host, but they cannot germinate and infect without several hours of sustained wet weather. Afternoon rain storms and wet conditions overnight provide ideal conditions for germination. Conidia germinate and form germ tubes which enter the host through stomata or through the cuticle, before forming intramatrical mycelia which moves through the plant and establishes the new infection. These mycelia give rise to further conidiophores and conidia, allowing for many infection cycles in each season.  \"Fusicladium effusum\" is thought to be an anamorph of Venturia fungus. This means that while it commonly reproduces asexually via conidia, it may also produce a teleomorph stage like other dothideomycetes in which pseudothecia carrying asci and sexual ascospores grow out of the hyphae. This allows for sexual reproduction and genetic recombination of the pathogen. The teleomorph stage, however, is very rare and literature on its characteristics are lacking.  The severity of infection depends in part on the timing of inoculation. A study by Gottwald and Bertrand in 1982 found that trees inoculated after late June, when the endocarp (shell) begins to form, suffered much less damage to nuts than those inoculated in May or early June during nuts set. Trees in the later category experienced the greatest disease severity around mid-season (mid-July through August), roughly 1.5 to 2 months after inoculation. A conducive environment for the propagation of pecan scab requires wet weather. For the spores to inoculate the host, there must be a period of wet weather in order for the infection to occur. The amount of rainfall isn't as important as the frequency of rainfall and length of time that the leaves and fruit stay wet. For example, the optimal time for a rain would be right before dusk because the plant will stay wet overnight thus increasing the period of time the pathogen has to infect the plant. The temperature isn't as critical of a factor in the environment. The pathogen thrives in adequate temperatures of spring and summer ranging from 20\u201330\u00b0 Celsius (68\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F). When there is a pecan orchard, cultural practices that increase the humidity levels also provide a good environment for the pathogen. These practices include close tree spacing, low limbs, and dense ground vegetation.",

Gymnosporangium sabinae (also Gymnosporangium fuscum and other names) (pear rust, European pear rust, or pear trellis rust) is a fungal heteroecious plant pathogen with \"Juniperus\" (Juniper trees and shrubs) as the primary (telial) host and only \"Pyrus\" (pear trees) as secondary (aecial) hosts. It is one of many types of rust fungi affecting plants. Like many rust diseases, \"G. sabinae\" requires two different hosts to complete its life cycle from year to year. Juniper is the winter host and pear is the most common summer host. Spores (called aeciospores) are produced from the fungal lantern-shaped growths which protrude from the blisters on the underside of the pear leaf which become airborne and infect junipers. This fungus overwinters in swellings or galls on infected twigs and branches of susceptible juniper plants. In the spring after a rain or heavy dew, the galls on the juniper produce tiny dark horn-like growths that become covered with an orange-brown gelatinous mass called telia. The corresponding stage on the pear trees is known as aecia. The telia and aecia release wind borne resting or hibernating spores (called teliospores and aeciospores) capable of infecting susceptible pear leaves and Juniper respectively. Spores produced from the fungus-induced swellings on juniper stems can be infectious up to 6\u00a0km. The disease causes a yellow-orange spot that turns bright red on leaves of pear trees. The disease can be particularly damaging on pear, resulting in complete defoliation and crop loss if not treated. The fungus feeds on the living cells of the host plant and is not capable of surviving on dead plant material, and so must either alternate with a different host or produce resting spores to pass the dormant season. Pear rust is a regulated disease in some countries.",

The major distinguishing feature is that sporangia and zoospores (swimming spores) are produced only rarely by \"P. u.\" var. \"ultimum\". Both species make oospores, which are thick-walled structures produced by sexual recombination. Both varieties are self-fertile (homothallic), which means that a single strain can mate with itself. In addition to oospores, \"P. u.\" var. \"ultimum\" also makes hyphal swellings which germinate in a manner resembling sporangia to form plant-infecting hyphae. One important ecological difference between the different types of spores is that sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, while the thick-walled oospores can persist for years within soil, surviving even winter freezes. Mycelia and oospores in soil can infect seeds or roots. This leads to wilting, reduced yield, and ultimately plant death. Common signs of a \"Pythium\" infection include stunting of the plants, brown coloration of root-tips, and wilting of the plant during the warm part of the day.

It survives the winter on lesions of previously infected fruit, plant debris, or simply in the soil. This fungus can survive up to a year in the soil. Conidia is released in the spring when the fungus is ready to infect its host, the eggplant. The conidia disperse by air or wind, or by rain-splash, and are able to infect a suitable host this way. Conidia infect an eggplant host by landing on the lower surface young leaves and entering the leaf through stomata or other natural openings of the plant or wounds on the plant. From infection, there appear to be visible lesions on the leaves. The germ tube of the fungus can enter both closed and open stomata. Multiple germ tubes from various conidia can enter the same stomata. This fungus has the best infection rates among young leaves and has a reduced infection rate of mature leaves. It is thought that the reduced infection rate of mature leaves is due to the saprophytic microflora on the leaves and the anti-fungal compounds produced by the mature leaf. This fungus produces secondary conidia within the same season; this furthers the disease cycle and allows the fungus to infect more plants. Mycelium rapidly develops.

In the United States this is a major pathogen of ornamentals, tobacco, and tomato. Black Shank is one of the most damaging and far reaching diseases of tobacco. In 1896, Black Shank was first described in Indonesia by Van Breda de Haan. Disease was observed near Georgia in 1915 and reached major tobacco growing areas of Kentucky and North Carolina in the 1930s and 1940s. In North Carolina black shank can be found in every county that grows flue-cured tobacco and currently causes statewide losses of 1 to 2.5 percent per year. This pathogen thrives in warm climates, so it is destructive on crops grown in these areas. During favorable conditions, new generations of spores can be produced every 72 hours, so if this disease is not managed well it can be very destructive. Susceptible cultivars in the right conditions can reach losses of 100 percent, because infected plants do not recover. Less than one propagule per gram of soil can lead to an epidemic.  This pathogen causes secondary cycles of disease by mode of zoospores. Zoospores interact with the host by sensing and moving toward the nutrient gradients near the root tip and wounds of the plant. Without this means of sensing entry points there would be no secondary cycles of disease. Zoospores, chlamydospores, and sporangia produce a germ tube that directly penetrates the epidermis of the plant. With out this penetration device the pathogen would not be able to infect the plant. The pathogen interferes with transport by infecting the roots. Typically hyphae can be seen in the pith and cause blackening and necrosis. Infection can proceed rapidly once the pathogen has made an entrance into the plant. Once established, further reproduction of both chlamydospores and sporangia will occur within host tissues, amplifying the spread of disease within the host plant and spreading out into nearby plants. Upon death of the host, the decomposing infected tissues will release the pathogen back into the soil, in the form of chlamydospores and zoospores.

Some commensal organisms, or organisms that occur in the body naturally and benefit from living in the host without causing it harm or conferring any significant benefit, also have the potential to become pathogens. This specific type of commensal/pathogen hybrid is called an opportunistic pathogen. Not all commensals are opportunistic pathogens. However, opportunistic pathogens are commensals by nature. They are not harmful for the body when the body's immune system is functioning normally, but if the host immune system becomes compromised, or loses its ability to function at its full or near-full potential, opportunistic pathogens switch from being a commensal organism to a pathogen. This is where the name opportunistic pathogen comes from: they are only pathogens when the opportunity to infect the host is there. An example of an opportunistic pathogen is Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a type of fungus/yeast found in the intestines and mucous membranes (like the vagina and throat) of healthy humans. It is also found on the skin of healthy humans. In healthy humans- meaning humans with functioning immune systems- Candida will not cause infections. It will simply co-exist with the host. However, if a person is in chemo therapy or has HIV/AIDS, which weakens the immune system (thus compromising it), Candida albicans will cause infections. It can cause infections as innocuous as yeast infections or thrush and it can cause infections as serious as systemic candidiasis which is fatal in about 50% of cases. Though the mechanisms Candida albicans uses to switch from being a commensal to a pathogen are largely unknown, the reasons for its strength as a pathogen are broadly known. Candida has plenty of phenotypic and genotypic plasticity which means it generates change quickly. As a result of constant diversification, candida has many opportunities to make advantageous mutations. Additionally, Candida can change morphology. It can convert from the yeast for to the filamentous form and vice versa, depending on which stage of infection it is in. In the beginning stages of infection, Candida is more likely to be in the filamentous form because this allows it to adhere to and infect cells more efficiently. Other adaptations of the commensal pathogen include the ability to grow at host temperature, create biofilms, resist reactive oxygen species (ROS) created as part of the human immune response to fight off infection, adapt to different pHs (relevant for being carried in the blood in different parts of the body) and adapt to low nutrient or low glucose environments like the liver Because Candida albicans is very good at adapting to the fluctuating environments of the humans body (i.e. its changing temperature, pH, oxygen reactivity and more) candida albicans is a good pathogen.",

This makes them susceptible to parasites, as the entire clonal population has the same resistance mechanisms.

Sexual reproduction mixes up resistance genes through crossing over and the random assortment of gametes in meiosis, meaning the members of a sexual population will all have subtly different combinations of resistance genes. This variation in resistance genes means no one parasite strain is able to sweep through the whole population. New Zealand mudsnails are commonly infected with trematode parasites, which are particularly abundant in shallow water, but scarce in deeper water. As predicted, sexual reproduction dominates in shallow water, due to its advantages in parasite resistance.

Through the loss of the genetic material that codes for a flagellum to form, \"Salmonella\" can evade a host's immune system. \"mgtC\" leader RNA from bacteria virulence gene (mgtCBR operon) decreases flagellin production during infection by directly base pairing with mRNAs of the \"fljB\" gene encoding flagellin and promotes degradation.

They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills.

The offspring of a population of sexually reproducing individuals will show a more varied selection of phenotypes and they will therefore be more likely to produce a strain that can survive a change in the ecology of the environment in which they live.

They developed a mathematical model to show that the fitness costs of sexual antagonism, even when rare, will usually overwhelm the benefits of sexually concordant selection. (Sexually concordant selection occurs when selection favors the same alleles in both sexes but differs in relative strength between them.) Through several advanced calculations, they concluded that even a small relative amount of sexual antagonism will overwhelm any benefit harvested from sexually concordant selection. Coming to the same conclusion as Hosken et al., they demonstrated mathematically that when sex-limited gene expression attempts to resolve sexual antagonism, it is likely to produce negative long-term fitness consequences. This result is seen in the experiment with beetles above, where the females demonstrate reduced fitness in response to males selected for larger mandibles. So, with mathematical support and a lack of support for strong fitness benefits as a result of sexually concordant selection, the paper concludes that sex-specific selection is more likely to incur costs than benefits to sexually reproducing species.",

This mode of reproduction is called \"asexual\", and it is still used by many species, particularly unicellular, but it is also very common in multicellular organisms, including many of those with sexual reproduction. In sexual reproduction, the genetic material of the offspring comes from two different individuals. As sexual reproduction developed by way of a long process of evolution, intermediates exist.

Some commensal organisms, or organisms that occur in the body naturally and benefit from living in the host without causing it harm or conferring any significant benefit, also have the potential to become pathogens. This specific type of commensal/pathogen hybrid is called an opportunistic pathogen. Not all commensals are opportunistic pathogens. However, opportunistic pathogens are commensals by nature. They are not harmful for the body when the body's immune system is functioning normally, but if the host immune system becomes compromised, or loses its ability to function at its full or near-full potential, opportunistic pathogens switch from being a commensal organism to a pathogen. This is where the name opportunistic pathogen comes from: they are only pathogens when the opportunity to infect the host is there. An example of an opportunistic pathogen is Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a type of fungus/yeast found in the intestines and mucous membranes (like the vagina and throat) of healthy humans. It is also found on the skin of healthy humans. In healthy humans- meaning humans with functioning immune systems- Candida will not cause infections. It will simply co-exist with the host. However, if a person is in chemo therapy or has HIV/AIDS, which weakens the immune system (thus compromising it), Candida albicans will cause infections. It can cause infections as innocuous as yeast infections or thrush and it can cause infections as serious as systemic candidiasis which is fatal in about 50% of cases. Though the mechanisms Candida albicans uses to switch from being a commensal to a pathogen are largely unknown, the reasons for its strength as a pathogen are broadly known. Candida has plenty of phenotypic and genotypic plasticity which means it generates change quickly. As a result of constant diversification, candida has many opportunities to make advantageous mutations. Additionally, Candida can change morphology. It can convert from the yeast for to the filamentous form and vice versa, depending on which stage of infection it is in. In the beginning stages of infection, Candida is more likely to be in the filamentous form because this allows it to adhere to and infect cells more efficiently. Other adaptations of the commensal pathogen include the ability to grow at host temperature, create biofilms, resist reactive oxygen species (ROS) created as part of the human immune response to fight off infection, adapt to different pHs (relevant for being carried in the blood in different parts of the body) and adapt to low nutrient or low glucose environments like the liver Because Candida albicans is very good at adapting to the fluctuating environments of the humans body (i.e. its changing temperature, pH, oxygen reactivity and more) candida albicans is a good pathogen.",

One paper, published in \"Evolution\", evaluates the hypothesis that sex-limited traits can arise in two ways. The alleles responsible for sexual dimorphism can be limited to expression in only one sex when they first appear, or the alleles could begin by being expressed in both sexes then become modified (repressed or promoted) in one sex by modifier genes or regulatory elements. The concept of this study was to examine female hybrids from species where males displayed different types of ornamental traits (elongated feathers, wattles, color patches). The assumption is that different hypotheses about male-specific expression will yield different results in female hybrids. The methods and materials of the experiment are discussed in detail in the paper, but the important result that emerged was that NO female hybrids expressed any of the ornamental traits found in the parent males. Two interpretations of these results are possible: the dimorphic alleles were initially only expressed in males, or the alleles were initially expressed in both and then were suppressed in females or became limited to males by regulatory regions that are \"completely dominant\" in hybrids. The most likely genomic explanation for initial expression in both species then modification is involvement of \"cis\"-dominance, where the factors that modify the gene are located next to the gene on the chromosome. (This is in contrast to \"trans\"-dominance, where mobile products that can affect distant genes are produced.) These factors can be in the form of promoter regions, which can be either be suppressed or activated by hormones. This experiment also demonstrates that these alleles come under regulatory control very quickly. This is because none of the ornamentation seen in males is seen in the \"very next \"generation. These conclusions make it likely that at least some male-specific (thus, sex-limited) genes cue their expression by hormone levels - the absence of estrogen or the presence of testosterone.",

These genes are highly polymorphic throughout populations, but will be more similar in smaller, more closely related populations. Breeding between more genetically distant individuals will decrease the chance of inheriting two alleles which are the same or similar, allowing a more diverse range of peptides to be presented. This therefore gives a decreased chance that any particular pathogen will not be recognised, and means that more antigenic proteins on any pathogen are likely to be recognised, giving a greater range of T-cell activation and therefore a greater response.

This hypothesis, known as the Bateman\u2019s Principle, is used to understand the evolutionary pressures put on males and females due to anisogamy. Although this assumption has criticism, it is a generally accepted model for sexual selection within anisogamous species. The selection for different traits depending on sex within the same species is known as sex-specific selection, and accounts for the differing phenotypes found between the sexes of the same species.

Natural vegetative reproduction is mostly a process found in herbaceous and woody perennial plants, and typically involves structural modifications of the stem or roots and in a few species leaves. Most plant species that employ vegetative reproduction do so as a means to perennialize the plants, allowing them to survive from one season to the next and often facilitating their expansion in size. A plant that persists in a location through vegetative reproduction of individuals constitutes a clonal colony; a single ramet, or apparent individual, of a clonal colony is genetically identical to all others in the same colony. The distance that a plant can move during vegetative reproduction is limited, though some plants can produce ramets from branching rhizomes or stolons that cover a wide area, often in only a few growing seasons. In a sense, this process is not one of reproduction but one of survival and expansion of biomass of the individual. When an individual organism increases in size via cell multiplication and remains intact, the process is called vegetative growth. However, in vegetative reproduction, the new plants that result are new individuals in almost every respect except genetic. A major disadvantage to vegetative reproduction, is the transmission of pathogens from parent to offspring; it is uncommon for pathogens to be transmitted from the plant to its seeds (in sexual reproduction or in apomixis), though there are occasions when it occurs.",

It survives as stromata, a tight mat of fungal material that lives within tissue. In the spring time, hyphae in the stromata germinate to produce solitary or loosely fasciculate conidiophores which produce conidia (asexual spores) in simple or branched chains. Conidia are dentical-like and have unthickened walls. Conidia are moved by wind and water to a susceptible host, but they cannot germinate and infect without several hours of sustained wet weather. Afternoon rain storms and wet conditions overnight provide ideal conditions for germination. Conidia germinate and form germ tubes which enter the host through stomata or through the cuticle, before forming intramatrical mycelia which moves through the plant and establishes the new infection. These mycelia give rise to further conidiophores and conidia, allowing for many infection cycles in each season.  \"Fusicladium effusum\" is thought to be an anamorph of Venturia fungus. This means that while it commonly reproduces asexually via conidia, it may also produce a teleomorph stage like other dothideomycetes in which pseudothecia carrying asci and sexual ascospores grow out of the hyphae. This allows for sexual reproduction and genetic recombination of the pathogen. The teleomorph stage, however, is very rare and literature on its characteristics are lacking.  The severity of infection depends in part on the timing of inoculation. A study by Gottwald and Bertrand in 1982 found that trees inoculated after late June, when the endocarp (shell) begins to form, suffered much less damage to nuts than those inoculated in May or early June during nuts set. Trees in the later category experienced the greatest disease severity around mid-season (mid-July through August), roughly 1.5 to 2 months after inoculation. A conducive environment for the propagation of pecan scab requires wet weather. For the spores to inoculate the host, there must be a period of wet weather in order for the infection to occur. The amount of rainfall isn't as important as the frequency of rainfall and length of time that the leaves and fruit stay wet. For example, the optimal time for a rain would be right before dusk because the plant will stay wet overnight thus increasing the period of time the pathogen has to infect the plant. The temperature isn't as critical of a factor in the environment. The pathogen thrives in adequate temperatures of spring and summer ranging from 20\u201330\u00b0 Celsius (68\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F). When there is a pecan orchard, cultural practices that increase the humidity levels also provide a good environment for the pathogen. These practices include close tree spacing, low limbs, and dense ground vegetation.",

            "document": "Functional molecular infection epidemiology . Functional Molecular Infection Epidemiology (FMIE) is an emerging area of medicine that entails the study of pathogen genes and genomes in the context of their functional association with the host niches (adhesion, invasion, adaptation) and the complex interactions they trigger within the host immune system (cell signaling, apoptosis) to culminate in varied outcomes of the infection. This can also be defined as the correlation of genetic variations in a pathogen or its respective host with a unique function that is important for disease severity, disease progression, or host susceptibility to a particular pathogen. Functional epidemiology implies not only descriptive host-pathogen genomic associations, but rather the interplay between pathogen and host genomic variations to functionally demonstrate the role of the genetic variations during infection.",

Three strains of the pathogen, P1, P2, and P3, were tested by methods following Koch\u2019s postulates to determine their role in the pathogenesis of these pineapple diseases. P1, a non-pigmented strain, has been identified as the main factor in the development of IFC, LP, and FCR due to its high occurrence of isolation from diseased pineapples. The other strains, both red pigmented are not as closely related to the symptoms of disease, determined by their low frequency of being present in diseased tissue. There are, however, times when P1 is not as pathogenic. In other laboratory studies, P1 was found to mutate to a less virulent form of the pathogen. The mutations also prevented successful production of conidial structures, which also lessens its ability to infect the host. Additionally, when P2 and P3 strains were in the same plant as P1, the level infection was lower, likely due to competition between the strains that reduced the virility of the infectious P1. This discovery suggests the possibility that P2 and P3 could be used as a biological control agent when other methods do not work.",

Because of the enormous variety of infectious microorganisms capable of causing disease, precise definitions for what constitutes a natural reservoir are numerous, various, and often conflicting. The reservoir concept applies only for pathogens capable of infecting more than one host population and only with respect to a defined target population \u2013 the population of organisms in which the pathogen causes disease. The reservoir is any population of organisms (or any environment) which harbors the pathogen and transmits it to the target population. Reservoirs may comprise one or more different species, may be the same or a different species as the target, and, in the broadest sense, may include vector species, which are otherwise distinct from natural reservoirs and should not be confused with them. Significantly, species considered reservoirs for a given pathogen may not experience symptoms of disease when infected by the pathogen.",
