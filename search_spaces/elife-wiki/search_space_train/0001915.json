Neuronatin begins the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into cells with a neural fate by increasing their calcium levels. Neuronatin expression in neural tissues throughout the brain contributes to development of the nervous system. It is also expressed in several tissues outside of the brain. For example, expression in skin cells controls the differentiation of keratinocytes. Neuronatin expression functions not only in development, but other processes throughout the body. It also plays a direct and indirect role in diabetes. Increased expression in pancreatic islet beta cells causes the beta form of the protein to build an aggregate structure. This causes the cells to undergo apoptosis, thus leading to diabetes mellitus. Its effects on glycogen metabolism through the dephosphorylation and activation of the enzyme glycogen synthase may also play an indirect role in contributing to the disease. A different type of malformation in the gene also has the potential to cause a variety of cancers. Contained within the promoter region of the gene are three CpG islands.

It is a type of cardiac arrhythmia. Ventricular fibrillation results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse. This is followed by death in the absence of treatment. Ventricular fibrillation is found initially in about 10% of people in cardiac arrest. Ventricular fibrillation can occur due to coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, electric shock, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing irregular unformed QRS complexes without any clear P waves. An important differential diagnosis is torsades de pointes. Treatment is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic. The medication epinephrine or amiodarone may be given if initial treatments are not effective. Rates of survival among those who are out of hospital when the arrhythmia is detected is about 17% while in hospital it is about 46%.  Ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body - because of this, it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause.

When the \u03b2AR is stimulated by catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, there is normally an increase in the contractility of the heart. However, in heart failure there are sustained and elevated levels of catecholamines which result in chronic desensitization of the \u03b2AR receptor. This leads to a decrease in the strength of heart contractions. Some research suggests that this chronic desensitization is due to the over activation of a kinase, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which phosphorylates and deactivates certain G protein coupled receptors . When the G protein coupled receptor is activated, the G subunit recruits GRK2 which then phosphorylates and desensitizes GPCRs like the \u03b2AR. Preventing the interaction of the \u03b2\u03b3 subunit with GRK2 has therefore been studied as a potential target for increasing heart contractile function. The developed molecule GRK2ct is a protein inhibitor which inhibits the signalling properties of G subunit but does not interfere with alpha subunit signalling. The over expression of GRK2ct has been shown to significantly rescue cardiac function in murine models of heart failure by blocking G subunit signalling.

Heart arrhythmia (also known as arrhythmia, dysrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat) is a group of conditions in which the heartbeat is irregular, too fast, or too slow. A heart rate that is too fast \u2013 above 100 beats per minute in adults \u2013 is called tachycardia and a heart rate that is too slow \u2013 below 60 beats per minute \u2013 is called bradycardia. Many types of arrhythmia have no symptoms. When symptoms are present these may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats. In more serious cases there may be lightheadedness, passing out, shortness of breath, or chest pain. While most types of arrhythmia are not serious, some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure. Others may result in cardiac arrest. There are four main types of arrhythmia: extra beats, supraventricular tachycardias, ventricular arrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias. Extra beats include premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions, and premature junctional contractions. Supraventricular tachycardias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Arrhythmias are due to problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart. Arrhythmias may occur in children; however, the normal range for the heart rate is different and depends on age. A number of tests can help with diagnosis including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter monitor. Most arrhythmias can be effectively treated. Treatments may include medications, medical procedures such as inserting a pacemaker, and surgery. Medications for a fast heart rate may include beta blockers or agents that attempt to restore a normal heart rhythm such as procainamide. This latter group may have more significant side effects especially if taken for a long period of time. Pacemakers are often used for slow heart rates. Those with an irregular heartbeat are often treated with blood thinners to reduce the risk of complications. Those who have severe symptoms from an arrhythmia may receive urgent treatment with a controlled electric shock in the form of cardioversion or defibrillation. Arrhythmia affects millions of people. In Europe and North America, as of 2014, atrial fibrillation affects about 2% to 3% of the population.

These impulses ultimately stimulate heart muscle to contract and thereby to eject blood from the ventricles into the arteries and the cardiac circulatory system; and they provide a system of intricately-timed and persistent signaling that controls the rhythmic beating of the heart muscle cells, especially the complex impulse-generation and muscle contractions in the atrial chambers.

In heart cells, calcium is important in generating electrical signals for heart muscle contraction, as well as generating force for this contraction. In consideration of these important properties of calcium, two conclusions can be drawn. First, with less calcium in the cell, there is a decrease in electrical signals for contraction, thus allowing time for the heart's natural pacemaker to rectify arrhythmic contractions. Secondly, lower calcium means a decrease in strength and rate of the contractions, which can be helpful in treatment of abnormally fast heart rates.",

As a result of underlying heart disease, this cardiac conductive tissue can become damaged from ischemia (a deprivation of oxygenated blood).

This can affect either side of the heart, and is described as a right or left BBB. Some BBB are permanent and involve a complete bundle blockage while others are dependent on the underlying activity of the heart. For example, certain situations of excessive or reduced heart rate (tachycardia or bradycardia, respectively) can cause a BBB known as a rate-dependent bundle branch block (RDBBB). This manifests in a similar fashion to a regular bundle branch block, but occurs only under conditions that affect contractile rate. Tachycardia-dependent bundle branch block (TDBBB) can affect either ventricle in the heart, and occurs when the heart's rate of contraction reaches an elevated level and becomes uncoupled from the heart's refractory period (the time it takes for a cardiac cell to \"reset\" for future contraction). Thus the cell is unable to contract by the time the next electrical stimuli is present, and a blocking of this signal occurs. This prolongation of the refractory period is related to a decreased sodium channel response in damaged tissue that shows an inactivation of sodium channels responsible for repolarization.",

In cardiovascular disease, Cx43 (connexin 43), a subunit of a connexon, is a general protein of the gap junction stimulating cardio myocyte muscle cells of intercalated discs facilitating synchronized beating of the heart. In the occurrence of cardiovascular disease the Cx43 subunit begins to show signs of oxidative stress, the ability of the heart to counteract the buildup of harmful toxins due to age or diet leading to reduced vascular functions. Additionally, reduced Cx43 expression in vascular tissue, which plays a part in ventricular remolding and healing of wounds after a myocardial infarction, are present in structural heart disease. However, the mechanisms of Cx43 in the heart are still poorly understood. Overall, these changes in Cx43 expression and oxidant stress can lead to abnormalities in the coordinated beating of the heart, predisposing it to cardiac arrhythmias.",

Gap junctions allow the action potential to be transferred from one cell to the next (they are said to \"electrically couple\" neighbouring cardiac cells). They are made from the connexin family of proteins, that form a pore through which ions (including Na, Ca and K) can pass. As potassium is highest within the cell, it is mainly potassium that passes through. This increased potassium in the neighbour cell causes the membrane potential to increase slightly, activating the sodium channels and initiating an action potential in this cell. (A brief chemical gradient driven efflux of Na+ through the connexon at peak depolarization causes the conduction of cell to cell depolarization, not potassium.) These connections allow for the rapid conduction of the action potential throughout the heart and are responsible for allowing all of the cells in the atria to contract together as well as all of the cells in the ventricles. Uncoordinated contraction of heart muscles is the basis for arrhythmia and heart failure.",

            "document": "Hein Wellens . Hein J. Wellens, MD was born November 13, 1935 in The Hague in the Netherlands. He studied medicine at the University of Leiden. Following two years of internal medicine he did three years of cardiology in the Wilhelmina Gasthuis Hospital of the University of Amsterdam under the guidance of Prof Dirk Durrer In the late sixties, at the University Hospital of Amsterdam, he started to investigate patients with cardiac arrhythmias by placing catheters into the heart allowing the recording of cardiac activation at different sites. By connecting these catheters to a pacing device, he showed that it was possible not only to initiate and terminate the clinically occurring cardiac arrhythmias but also to localize the site of origin of the arrhythmia and to discover its mechanism. By using this approach, called programmed electrical stimulation of the heart, Dr. Wellens not only unravelled mechanisms and localization of arrhythmias in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, but also of the other types of supra ventricular tachycardias.  In the early seventies, a major breakthrough came when he showed that programmed electrical stimulation of the heart could also be used to study the mechanism and localization of ventricular tachycardia, opening new ways for its treatment. In 1971 he published the first book on programmed stimulation of the heart in patients with tachycardias. In 1973 Dr. Wellens was appointed Professor of Cardiology at the University of Amsterdam. At that time it had become clear that this new approach allowed the investigation of the effect of drugs on the tachycardia mechanism and the development of new therapeutic strategies such as the termination of tachycardias by specially designed pacemakers, the surgical removal or isolation of the tachycardia substrate and ultimately cure from cardiac arrhythmias by catheter ablation. The work of Dr. Wellens has not only been the basis for the way arrhythmias are currently investigated and treated, but by carefully analyzing electrocardiographic recordings in relation to information from programmed stimulation of the heart, he opened new ways to use the electrocardiogram as a reliable (non-invasive) source to become informed about the site of origin and mechanism of a cardiac arrhythmia.  Dr. Wellens left Amsterdam in 1977 to become Professor and Chairman of the Department of Cardiology at the Academic Hospital of the new Maastricht University. There he created his school of arrhythmology, educating in the period 1977-2001 more than 130 cardiologists from all over the world. Many of them, after returning to their home country, became internationally known leaders in cardiology. Dr. Wellens, who also directed from 1993 to 2003 the Interuniversity Cardiological Institute of the Netherlands (ICIN), an Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in which the Dutch research activities in cardiovascular research are combined at the national level, wrote or co-authored over 670 peer-reviewed articles, 254 chapters in books, and was author or (co) editor of 21 books on cardiology. In his scientific career dr. Wellens made several important contributions that fundamentally changed the approach to investigate and treat cardiac disease. His teaching and writing skills allowed him to convince his colleagues worldwide to use these new approaches to the benefit of their patients.",

Others suggest that the main cause of arrhythmias is a difference in the electrical properties between the inside (endocardium) and outside (epicardium) of the heart (known as the repolarisation hypothesis). The pattern of electrical activity that an individual heart cell shows when it contracts (known as an action potential) differs between the epicardium and the endocardium. The action potential in cells from the epicardium shows a prominent notch after the initial spike due to a transient inward current. This notch is far less evident in cells from the endocardium, and the difference between the endocardium and epicardium are most clearly seen in the right ventricle. In those with Brugada syndrome, these differences are increased, creating a brief period within each cardiac cycle when current flows from the endocardium to the epicardium creating the characteristic ECG pattern. The differences in electrical properties between the epi- and endocardium are described as a 'transmural dispersion of repolarisation\" which if large enough can lead to electrical impulses becoming blocked in some regions but not others. Once again, this wavebreak can allow the waves of electricity which usually travel in only one direction to instead begin circling around a point as a re-entrant circuit, causing an arrhythmia.",

            "document": "Italian crested newt . The most basic aspect of the heart s the cardiovascular compartment\u2019s ability to facilitate and maintain circulation. The structures of the heart play a vital role in its ability to do this. Important structures include:the muscular wall that has the function to contract and therefore pump blood throughout the organism (this wall is both vascularised and innervated, and n newts, innervated mainly by the vagus nerve,) the inside endothelial layer called the endocardium, and the outside mesothelial layer called the epicardium. Contraction of the heart is due to the electrical stimuli (signals) that are received from the central nervous system in organisms. More specific to amphibian hearts, the capacity to regenerate is actually higher than many animals, humans included. This ability allows organisms to survive trauma to the heart. In newt hearts, this ability is not as impressive. When there is injury to the heart muscle, scar tissue will form and weaken the heart, making it more susceptible to later problems. However, some regeneration does occur. In later testing, it was discovered that when the trauma is to the base region of the heart, regenerative capacities are of a much stronger nature. The evidence of regeneration is seen in the production of DNA. This shows that new cells are being made to reconstruct the tissue that was lost or damaged during injury to the cardiac muscle. Furthermore, the presence of mitotic figures seen defines division and creation of new cells. These appear in the striated muscle of the heart. The bottom line of these phenomena is that newts are capable of cardiac regeneration, but it is very dependent on where the damage occurs, because of the differing capability of different regions of the heart in the creation of new cells and building of new tissue. In short, where the damage occurs is directly related to how much regeneration will occur.",

This is true in all areas of the world except Africa.  In addition, during a typical myocardial infarction or heart attack, an estimated one billion cardiac cells are lost. The scarring that results is then responsible for greatly increasing the risk of life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias. Therefore, the ability to naturally regenerate the heart would have an enormous impact of modern healthcare. However, while several animals can regenerate heart damage (e.g. the axolotl), mammalian cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) cannot proliferate (multiply) and heart damage causes scarring and fibrosis.",

Anyone can be affected with this because overall health does not play a role in the problem. Problems with the electrical pathway of the heart can cause very fast or even deadly arrhythmias. Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome is due to an extra pathway in the heart that is made up of electrical muscle tissue. This tissue allows the electrical impulse, which stimulates the heartbeat, to happen very rapidly. Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia is the most common type of ventricular tachycardia in otherwise healthy individuals. This defect is due to an electrical node in the right ventricle just before the pulmonary artery. When the node is stimulated, the patient will go into ventricular tachycardia, which does not allow the heart to fill with blood before beating again. Long QT syndrome is another complex problem in the heart and has been labeled as an independent factor in mortality. There are multiple methods of treatment for these including cardiac ablations, medication treatment, or lifestyle changes to have less stress and exercise.",
