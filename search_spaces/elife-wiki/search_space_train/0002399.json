Shortly thereafter, two studies reported that gain-of-function mutations in LRP5 caused high bone mass. Many bone density related diseases are caused by mutations in the LRP5 gene. There is controversy whether bone grows through Lrp5 through bone or the intestine. The majority of the current data supports the concept that bone mass is controlled by LRP5 through the osteocytes. Mice with the same Lrp5 gain-of-function mutations as also have high bone mass. The high bone mass is maintained when the mutation only occurs in limbs or in cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Bone mechanotransduction occurs through Lrp5 and is suppressed if Lrp5 is removed in only osteocytes. There are promising osteoporosis clinical trials targeting sclerostin, an osteocyte-specific protein which inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to Lrp5. An alternative model that has been verified in mice and in humans is that Lrp5 controls bone formation by inhibiting expression of TPH1, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin, a molecule that regulates bone formation, in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum and that excess plasma serotonin leads to inhibition in bone. Another study found that a different Tph1-inhibitor decreased serotonin levels in the blood and intestine, but did not affect bone mass or markers of bone formation.",

In this case, the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown. GDF6 and GDF3 genes provide the body with instructions for making proteins involved in regulating the growth and maturation of bone and cartilage. These proteins actively regulate cell growth in embryonic and adult tissue. GDF6 specifically is involved in the formation of vertebral bones, among others, and establishing boundaries between bones in skeletal development while GDF3 is involved with bone and cartilage growth. Mutations cause reductions in these functional proteins but, it is unclear exactly how a shortage in these proteins leads to incomplete separation of the vertebrae in people with Klippel\u2013Feil syndrome. However, when the GDF6 gene was knocked out in mice, the result was the fusion of bones. Only by identifying the link between the genetic cause and the phenotypic pathoanatomy of Klippel\u2013Feil syndrome will we be able to rationalize the heterogeneity of the syndrome.",

Taken with the data, that mice lacking the pln gene cannot maintain stable cartilage, it is apparent that perlecan is essential to the maturation and stability of cartilaginous structure. This is supported by a study showing that knockdown of perlecan production inhibits the final stages of chondrogenic differentiation in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts in culture. Bone development, i.e. mineralization of cartilaginous tissue, correlates with loss of perlecan and heparan sulfate at the chondro-osseous junction (COJ). In an effort to understand how heparan sulfate and perlecan direct mesenchymal stem cells into the osteogenic pathway, human mesenchymal stem cells were treated with heparanase and chondroitinase in culture. This led to increased mineralization and expression of osteocyte markers, supporting the data showing that loss of heparan sulfate at the COJ is a key factor in osteogenesis.

Research done using Zebrafish \"dackel (dak)\" have shown that in \"EXT2-/-\" Zebrafish, chondrocytes fail to undergo terminal differentiation and bone formation fails to progress from pre-osteoblasts stage to osteoblasts. Instead, abnormal lipid deposition and premature adipocyte differentiation takes place. The expression of \"xbp1\", master regulator of \"osterix\" gets reduced, suggesting that unfolded proteins responses may play a role in pathogenesis of multiple osteochondroma. The research concludes that heparan sulphates are required for terminal differentiation and formation of scaffold that is needed for bone development. At least one copy of \"EXT2\" gene is needed for proper bone development and to maintain the balance between bone and fat cell lineages. Due to homozygous loss of \"EXT2\" function, leads to imbalance between cartilage, bone, and fat cell lineages. These observations in null zebrafish points toward the musculoskeletal defects observed in patients with multiple osteochondroma. Due to the findings of bone-fat imbalance in Zebra fish model, future studies should address status of lipid composition in patients with multiple osteochondroma. Research conducted using sequencing methods has identified a novel frame shift mutation at the glycosyltransferase domain (c.1457insG) located at codon 486 of exon 6 of the \"EXT1\" gene, that causes multiple osteochondromas. This study was conducted in two multiple osteochondroma (MO) patients from the Chinese descent (same family) and the results were validated with four other members of the same MO family and 200 unrelated healthy subjects. The results of the mutations were validated using two different sequencing methods (Exome and Sanger). The results of immunohistochemistry and multiple sequence alignment supports the cause of MO being a mutation in \"EXT1\" gene. However, the exact molecular mechanism of multiple osteochondroma remains unclear. The \"EXT1\" gene encodes the endoplasmic reticulum-resident type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes polymerization of heparin sulfate chain at the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Heparin sulfate regulates signal transduction during chondrocyte differentiation, ossification, and apoptosis. Malfunction in heparin sulfate synthesis causes chondrocytes to rapidly differentiate. Based on these results future studies should elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the glycosyltransferase domain of the \"EXT1\" and its involvement in the development of multiple osteochondromas. Osteochondromas are associated with secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas, but the pathogenesis of the malignant bone tumor remains unknown. Research has demonstrated that chondrocytes with dysfunctional \"EXT1\" is present in solitary osteochondromas, but the \"EXT1\" is functional in sporadic (solitary) secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. Research indicates that osteochondromas creates a special niche in which wild type cells are mixed in with \"EXT\" functional cells. Then these \"EXT\" functional cells undergo other mutations, that give rise to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, indicating the involvement of an alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Future studies should address the contributing gene that causes the formation of peripheral chondrosarcoma. It should also illustrate what causes chondrocytes functional with \"EXT1\" and \"EXT2\" within the osteochondroma to become more susceptible to mutations leading to malignancy.",

This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior in a number of ways such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both \"ENG\" and \"ACVRL1\" mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.",

            "document": "Catenin . The primary mechanical role of catenins is connecting cadherins to actin filaments, specifically in these adhesion junctions of epithelial cells. Most studies investigating catenin actions focus on \u03b1-catenin and \u03b2-catenin. \u03b2-catenin is particularly interesting as it plays a dual role in the cell. First of all, by binding to cadherin receptor intracellular cytoplasmic tail domains, it can act as an integral component of a protein complex in adherens junctions that helps cells maintain epithelial layers. \u03b2-catenin acts by anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the junctions, and may possibly aid in contact inhibition signaling within the cell. For instance, when an epithelial layer is complete and the adherens junctions indicate that the cell is surrounded, \u03b2-catenin may play a role in telling the cell to stop proliferating, as there is no room for more cells in the area. Secondly, \u03b2-catenin participates in the Wnt signaling pathway as a downstream target. While the pathway is very detailed and not completely understood, in general, when Wnt is not present, GSK-3B (a member of the pathway) is able to phosphorylate \u03b2-catenin as a result of a complex formation that includes \u03b2-catenin, AXIN1, AXIN2, APC (a tumor suppressor gene product), CSNK1A1, and GSK3B. Following phosphorylation of the N-terminal Ser and Thr residues of \u03b2-catenin, BTRC promotes its ubiquitination, which causes it to be degraded by the TrCP/SKP complex. On the other hand, when Wnt is present, GSK-3B is displaced from the previously mentioned complex, causing \u03b2-catenin to not be phosphorylated, and thus not ubiquitinated. As a result, its levels in the cell are stabilized as it builds up in the cytoplasm. Eventually, some of this accumulated \u03b2-catenin will move into the nucleus with the help of Rac1. At this point, \u03b2-catenin becomes a coactivator for TCF and LEF to activate Wnt genes by displacing Groucho and HDAC transcription repressors. These gene products are important in determining cell fates during normal development and in maintaining homeostasis, or they can lead to de-regulated growth in disorders like cancer by responding to mutations in \u03b2-catenin, APC or Axin, each of which can lead to this de-regulated \u03b2-catenin level stabilization in cells.",

Hedgehog signaling in the intestinal epithelium represses the canonical Wnt signaling to restrict expression of Wnt target genes to stem or progenitor cells. It was thought that the Hedgehog signaling pathway does this via the induction of the secreted-type Wnt inhibitor. Katoh et al. searched for the GLI-binding site within the promoter region of Wnt inhibitor genes. GLI are transcription factors that activate the transcription of Hedgehog target genes. The GLI-binding site was identified within the 5\u2019-flanking promoter region of the human SFRP1 gene. The GLI-binding site was conserved among promoter regions of mammalian SFRP1 orthologs. These facts indicate that the SFRP1 gene was identified as the evolutionarily conserved target of the Hedgehog-GLI signaling pathway. SFRP1 was found to be expressed in mesenchymal cells. Hedgehog is secreted from differentiated epithelial cells to induce SFRP1 expression in mesenchymal cells, which keeps differentiated epithelial cells away from the effect of canonical Wnt signaling. Thus, SFRP1 is most likely the Hedgehog target to confine canonical Wnt signaling within stem or progenitor cells.

The activation of these pathways result in increased proliferation, invasion and migration of BCSCs. As a result, primary breast cancer tumors quickly form metastases in distant sites. Both the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) are key components of driving this metastasis process. As one may expect, BCSCs undergo both of these processes as they escape from the primary tumor site, enter the bloodstream and home to a new organ site to initiate tumor growth. Over the course of this process, there is an upregulation of growth factors, which in turn activate and deactivate mesenchymal and epithelial transcription factors. The combination of these factors provides the signaling cues needed by BCSCs to survive, grow and proliferate.

Dysregulation of the Notch and Hedgehog pathways, which regulate normal stem cell differentiation and self-renewal, is one such example.

In a small proportion of cases, basal cell carcinoma also develops as a result of basal cell nevus syndrome, or Gorlin Syndrome, which is also characterized by keratocystic odontogenic tumors of the jaw, palmar or plantar (sole of the foot) pits, calcification of the falx cerebri (in the center line of the brain) and rib abnormalities. The cause of this syndrome is a mutation in the PTCH1 tumor suppressor gene located in chromosome 9q22.3, which inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway. A mutation in the SMO gene, which is also on the hedgehog pathway, also causes basal-cell carcinoma. To diagnose basal cell carcinomas, a skin biopsy is performed for histopathologic analyses. The most common method is a shave biopsy under local anesthesia. Most nodular basal cell cancers can be diagnosed clinically; however, other variants can be very difficult to distinguish from benign lesions such as intradermal naevus, sebaceomas, fibrous papules, early acne scars, and hypertrophic scarring.",

TLR4 is capable of activating MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways, implicating possible direct role of cell-autonomous TLR4 signaling in regulation of carcinogenesis, in particular, through increased proliferation of tumor cells, apoptosis inhibition and metastasis. TLR4 signaling may also contribute to resistance to paclitaxel chemotherapy in ovary cancer and siRNA therapy in prostate cancer. 63% of breast cancer patients were reported to express TLR4 on tumor cells and the level of expression inversely correlated with the survival. Additionally, low MyD88 expression correlated with decreased metastasis to the lung and decreased CCL2 and CCL5 expression. TLR4 expression levels were the highest among TLRs in human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and TLR4 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation and decreased IL-6 and IL-8 levels. On the other hand, TLR4 signaling in immune and inflammatory cells of tumor microenvironment may lead to production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, etc.), immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, etc.) and angiogenic mediators (VEGF, EGF, TGF-\u03b2, etc.). These activities may result in further polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, conversion of fibroblasts into tumor-promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts, conversion of dendritic cells into tumor-associated DCs and activation of pro-tumorigenic functions of immature myeloid cells - Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC). TLR signaling has been linked to accumulation and function of MDSC at the site of tumor and it also allows mesenchymal stromal cells to counter NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. In HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells LPS increased TLR4 levels, cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy, and these phenomena could be reversed by TLR4 gene knockdown. Similarly, LPS stimulation of human liver cancer cell line H7402 resulted in TLR4 upregulation, NF-\u03baB activation, TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 production and increased proliferation that could be reversed by signal transducer and STAT3 inhibition.Besides the well known successful usage of Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) in the therapy of bladder cancer there are reports on the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer and cervical cancer with lyophilized streptococcal preparation OK-432 and utilization of TLR4/TLR2 ligands \u2013 derivatives of muramyl dipeptide.",

An in vitro study using a cell line of human prostate cancer blocked endogenous Tbx2 using Tbx2 dominant-negative retroviral vectors found reduced tumor cell proliferation. Further, the same study suggests targeting WNT3A because of its role in cell-signaling with Tbx2, by utilizing a WNT antagonist such as SFRP-2. Because somatic cells have low expression of Tbx2, a targeted Tbx2 gene treatment would leave healthy somatic cells unharmed, thereby providing a treatment with low toxicity and negative side effects.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are known to withstand cancer chemotherapy treatment and do not respond to any kind of therapy (in 2001) in advanced cases. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (imatinib) is effective in the treatment of patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors consist of a cluster of mesenchymal neoplasms that are formed from precursors to cells that make up the connective-tissue in the gastrointestinal tract. Most of these tumors are found in the stomach, though they can also be located in the small intestine or elsewhere in the intestinal tract. The cells of these tumors have a growth factor receptor associated with tyrosine kinase activity. This growth factor receptor is called c-kit and is produced by a proto-oncogene (\"c-kit\"). Mutation of c-kit causes the constitutive activity of tyrosine kinase, which results in cancerous gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Results of c-kit mutation include unrestricted tyrosine kinase activity and cell proliferation, unregulated phosphorylation of c-kit, and disruption of some communication pathways. Therapy with imatinib can inhibit the non-normal cell signaling mechanisms in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This results in significant responses in patients and sustained disease control. By 2001 it was no longer doubted that this inhibitor can be effective and safe in humans. In similar manner, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was found to significantly reduce the physical size of tumors; they decreased roughly 65% in size in 4 months of trialing, and continued to diminish. New lesions did not appear, and a number of the liver metastases completely reduced to non-existence. The single patient in the study remained healthy following treatment. There are no effective means of treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but that STI571 represents an effective treatment in early stage cancer associated with constitutively active c-kit, by inhibiting unfavourable tyrosine kinase activity.",

Moreover, FGF signaling inhibition dramatically reduces revascularization, hitting upon one of the hallmarks of cancers, angiogenesis, and reduces tumor burden in human tumors that depend on autocrine FGF signaling based on FGF2 upregulation following the common VEGFR-2 therapy for breast cancer. In such a way, FGFR1 can act synergistically with therapies to cut off cancer clonal resurgence by eliminating potential pathways of future relapse.",

It is found in larger amounts than in healthy cells in a wide range of cancers including breast, prostate, bladder, uterine, and renal cancers, as well as melanoma and lymphoma. EZH2 is a gene suppressor, so when it becomes overexpressed, many tumor suppressor genes that are normally turned on, are turned off. Inhibition of EZH2 function shrinks malignant tumors in some reported cases because those tumor suppressor genes are not silenced by EZH2. EZH2 typically is not expressed in healthy adults; it is only found in actively dividing cells, like those active during fetal development. Because of this characteristic, overexpression of EZH2 can be used as a diagnostic marker of cancer and some neurodegenerative disorders. However, there are cases where it is difficult to tell whether overexpression of EZH2 is the cause of a disease, or simply a consequence. If it is only a consequence, targeting EZH2 for inhibition may not cure the disease. One example of a cancer pathway in which EZH2 plays a role is the pRB-E2F pathway. It is downstream from the pRB-E2F pathway, and signals from this pathway lead to EZH2 overexpression. Another important characteristic of EZH2 is that when EZH2 is overexpressed, it can activate genes without forming PRC2. This is an issue because it means the methylation activity of the enzyme is not mediated by complex formation. In breast cancer cells, EZH2 activates genes that promote cell proliferation and survival. It can also activate regulatory genes like c-myc and cyclin D1 by interacting with Wnt signaling factors. Importantly, the mutation of tyrosine 641 to phenylalanine in the active SET domain of EZH2 results in preference for H3K27 tri-methylation and has been linked to lymphoma.",
