Mutations in VCP cause multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), a dominantly inherited, pleiotropic, degenerative disorder of humans that can affect muscle, bone and/or the central nervous system. MSP can manifest clinically as classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), inclusion body myopathy (IBM), Paget's disease of bone (PDB), or as a combination of these disorders. A useful operational definition of MSP is dominantly inherited degeneration that includes neurological involvement (either motor neuron disease or dementia) in combination with either distal myopathy or Pagetic bone degeneration. Most MSP patients present with weakness and of these ~65% present with motor neuron involvement. Up to 30% of MSP patients may have exclusively motor neuron involvement. Although MSP is rare, growing interest in this syndrome derives from the molecular insights the condition provides into the etiological relationship between common age-related degenerative diseases of muscle, bone and brain. It has been estimated that ~50% of MSP may be caused by missense mutations affecting the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene.",

It was historically believed to be caused by aggregation and deposition of the affected protein similar to other polyglutamine expansion diseases, however rodent model studies have shown significantly later formation of nuclear inclusions of mutant proteins in cerebellum and spinal cord neurons than in cortical and hippocampal neurons which typically show only mild degeneration in SCA1 persons, suggesting a more complicated mechanism. Ataxin-null mice are shown to exhibit reduced motor and spatial learning, suggesting ataxin 1 plays a role in synaptic plasticity and interactions between the motor neurons and the hippocampus. However mice lacking both copies of ataxin 1 do not develop progressive neurological symptoms or show signs of atrophy, suggesting that toxicity of the mutated protein, not loss of function, is the main mechanism for SCA1 pathology. A comparison of mRNA between ataxin null mice and mice with ataxin1 shows that there are common changes in gene expression, including upregulation of genes known to be repressed by an ataxin 1/CIC complex. This suggest that, while not the primary mechanism, a loss of ataxin 1 function contributes to the pathogenesis of SCA1. The loss of function is believed to be caused by an increased affinity for the expanded ataxin 1 for RNA Binding Motif 17, which excludes it from forming its normal complexes with CIC. The gain of function, in turn, is caused by its increased affinity for a number of other proteins.Mutant ataxin-1 also known to alter the neural circuitry of the developing cerebellum, setting the stage for later vulnerability of Purkinje cells, suggesting the existence of non-cell autonomous toxicity.",

Parkinson's disease is a condition that causes the degradation of neurons, resulting in tremors, rigidity, and other non-motor symptoms. Research has found evidence that microtubule assembly and stability in the cytoskeleton is compromised causing the neurons to degrade over time. Alzheimer's disease is much like Parkinson's in that it is also a neurodegenerative disease that affects the cytoskeleton. Tau proteins, which stabilize microtubules, malfunction in patient's affected by Alzheimers, causing pathology with the cytoskeleton. Huntington's disease has also been found to affect the cytoskeleton of cells by excess glutamine in the Huntington protein, which is involved with linking vesicles to the cytoskeleton.

A parent with 35 repeats would be considered \"normal\" and never exhibit any symptoms of the disease. That parent's offspring, however, would be at an increased risk compared to the general population of developing Huntington's, as it would take only the addition of one more CAG codon to cause the production of mHTT (mutant HTT), the protein responsible for disease. Huntington's very rarely occurs spontaneously; it is \"almost\" always the result of inheriting the defective gene from an affected parent. Sporadic cases of Huntington's do occur, and those individuals with a parent who already has a significant number of CAG repeats in their \"HTT\" gene, especially if it approaches the number (36) required for the disease to manifest, are at an increased risk of developing Huntington's despite the lack of any history of the disease in their family. Also, the more repeats, the more severe the disease and the earlier its onset. This explains why individuals that have had Huntington's running in their family for a longer period of time show an earlier age of disease onset and faster disease progression, as mutations that add additional CAG codons become more likely with each successive generation.",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND), and Lou Gehrig's disease, is a specific disease which causes the death of neurons controlling voluntary muscles. Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common. ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size. This results in difficulty speaking, swallowing, and eventually breathing. The cause is not known in 90% to 95% of cases. The remaining 5\u201310% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes. The underlying mechanism involves damage to both upper and lower motor neurons. The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes. No cure for ALS is known. A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months. Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50. The average survival from onset to death is two to four years. About 10% survive longer than 10 years. Most die from respiratory failure. In much of the world, rates of ALS are unknown. In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two to three people per 100,000 per year. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell. In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\". It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide following the 1963 diagnosis of cosmologist Stephen Hawking. In 2014, videos of the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on the Internet and increased public awareness of the condition. ALS is a motor neuron disease, also spelled \"motor neurone disease\", which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy.",

Pathologically, neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are all characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, cognitive decline, motor impairments, and sensory loss. Collectively these diseases fall within a broad category referred to as proteinopathies, due to the common assemblage of misfolded or aggregated intracellular or extracellular proteins. According to the prevailing amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, the aggregation of amyloid-beta (a peptide normally produced in and cleared from the healthy young brain) into extracellular plaques drives the neuronal loss and brain atrophy that is the hallmark of Alzheimer's dementia. Although the full extent of the glymphatic system's involvement in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear, researchers have demonstrated through experiments with genetically modified mice that the proper function of the glymphatic clearance system was necessary to remove soluble amyloid-beta from the brain interstitium. In mice that lack the AQP4 gene, amyloid-beta clearance is reduced by approximately 55 percent.",

The conditional expression of ATXN1 in mice models differs from how the gene would be silenced therapeutically but the results indicate that therapeutic methods of gene silencing may be viable for treatment and management of SCA1.

Approximately 1,000 various G-quadruplex ligands exist in which they are able to interact via their aromatic rings; this allows the small-molecule ligands to stack on the planar terminal tetrads within the G-quadruplex regions. A disadvantage of using small-molecule ligands as a therapeutic technique is that specificity is difficult to manage due to the variability of G-quadruplexes in their primary sequences, orientation, thermodynamic stability, and nucleic acid strand stoichiometry. As of now, no single small-molecule ligand has been able to be 100% specific for a single G-quadruplex sequence. However, a cationic porphyrin known as TMPyP4 is able to bind to the C9orf72 GGGGCC repeat region, which causes the G-quadruplex repeat region to unfold and lose its interactions with proteins causing it to lose its functionality. Small-molecule ligands, composed primarily of lead, can target GGGGCC repeat regions as well and ultimately decreased both repeat-associated non-ATG translation and RNA foci in neuron cells derived from patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Ataxin-null mice are shown to exhibit reduced motor and spatial learning, suggesting ataxin 1 plays a role in synaptic plasticity and interactions between the motor neurons and the hippocampus. However mice lacking both copies of ataxin 1 do not develop progressive neurological symptoms or show signs of atrophy, suggesting that toxicity of the mutated protein, not loss of function, is the main mechanism for SCA1 pathology. A comparison of mRNA between ataxin null mice and mice with ataxin1 shows that there are common changes in gene expression, including upregulation of genes known to be repressed by an ataxin 1/CIC complex. This suggest that, while not the primary mechanism, a loss of ataxin 1 function contributes to the pathogenesis of SCA1. The loss of function is believed to be caused by an increased affinity for the expanded ataxin 1 for RNA Binding Motif 17, which excludes it from forming its normal complexes with CIC. The gain of function, in turn, is caused by its increased affinity for a number of other proteins.Mutant ataxin-1 also known to alter the neural circuitry of the developing cerebellum, setting the stage for later vulnerability of Purkinje cells, suggesting the existence of non-cell autonomous toxicity.",

RNA binding proteins contain domains that have only a few types of amino acids; these domains are termed \"low complexity domains\" and have a strong tendency to aggregate. A highly unusual and important aspect of these proteins is that they use reversible aggregation as normal biological mechanism to sequester RNA transcripts. RNA binding proteins form a variety of cellular aggregates including stress granules, transport granules, P-bodies and nuclear speckles. In 2010 Dr. Wolozin's group was one of the first groups to suggest that dysfunction of the stress granule pathway contributes to the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since then, a growing body of evidence, increasingly highlights the important contributions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), stress granules and translational regulation in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease.

Work by Disney and Petrucelli rationally identified small molecules that can target this repeat and affect disease biology in model cellular systems and also in patient-derive iNeurons. Further studies by Rothstein and colleagues determined that TMPyP4 could suppress r(GC)-mediated neurodegeneration in a \"Drosophila\" model. Additionally targets have been rationally identified by using a powerful seqecune-based design approach termed informal to identify dozens of bioactive small molecules that target disease causing non-coding RNA termed INFORNA. This study important showed for the first time that small molecules appear to have selectivities that are competitive with oligonucleotides with cell-permeable and medicinally optimizable small molecules. Additionally, compounds have been shown to be bioactive in diverse disease settings that ranged from breast cancer. and hepatocellular carcinoma. More recently, the Disney group further used their prediction database INFORNA to design Targaprimir-96 to target miRNA precursors in animal models of cancer, the first small molecules to do so. This compound has a nanomolar affinity for the miRNA hairpin precursor selectively over other sequences. Targaprimir-96 was further tested in cells and in mice, inhibiting tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of triple negative breast cancer upon i.p. injection. RNA-targeting small molecule drug discovery has greatly benefitted from the available cellular models for disease. The use of cell culture in early development has become a requirement for assessing the basic efficacy of a drug candidate. Thus, more research groups have implemented these techniques in their programs. In a leading example, Al-Hashimi and coworkers identified six small molecules with high affinity for TAR of HIV-1 through a computational approach. They docked a library of small molecules onto RNA dynamic structures generated by NMR and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The hit molecules inhibited the Tat\u2014TAR interaction \"in vitro\". They arrived at lead molecule, netilmicin, that had the best selectivity for HIV-1 TAR and inhibited HIV-1 replication in cells with a low IC50.

Using their prediction database INFORNA, they discovered that a compound could bind to 1 x 1 UU internal loops on an N-methyl peptide backbone. They confirmed that like other compounds that target DM1 r(CUG), they could inhibit the complex between r(CUG)-MBNL1, disrupt nuclear foci, and increase nucleocytoplasmic transport of the gene in patient-derived DM1 fibroblasts.

A few examples of RNPs include the ribosome, the enzyme telomerase, vault ribonucleoproteins, RNase P, hnRNP and small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs), which have been implicated in pre-mRNA splicing (spliceosome) and are among the main components of the nucleolus. Some viruses are simple ribonucleoproteins, containing only one molecule of RNA and a number of identical protein molecules. Others are ribonucleoprotein or deoxyribonucleoprotein complexes containing a number of different proteins, and exceptionally more nucleic acid molecules.Currently, over 2000 RNPs can be found in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Furthermore, the Protein-RNA Interface Data Base (PRIDB) possesses a collection of information on RNA-protein interfaces based on data drawn from the PDB. Some common features of protein-RNA interfaces were deduced based on known structures. For example, RNP in snRNPs have an RNA-binding motif in its RNA-binding protein. Aromatic amino acid residues in this motif result in stacking interactions with RNA. Lysine residues in the helical portion of RNA-binding proteins help to stabilize interactions with nucleic acids. This nucleic acid binding is strengthened by electrostatic attraction between the positive lysine side chains and the negative nucleic acid phosphate backbones. Additionally, it is possible to model RNPs computationally. Although computational methods of deducing RNP structures are less accurate than experimental methods, they provide a rough model of the structure which allows for predictions of the identity of significant amino acids and nucleotide residues. Such information helps in understanding the overall function the RNP.'RNP' can also refer to ribonucleoprotein particles. Ribonucleoprotein particles are distinct intracellular foci for post-transcriptional regulation. These particles play an important role in influenza A virus replication. The influenza viral genome is composed of eight ribonucleoprotein particles formed by a complex of negative-sense RNA bound to a viral nucleoprotein. Each RNP carries with it an RNA polymerase complex. When the nucleoprotein binds to the viral RNA, it is able to expose the nucleotide bases which allow the viral polymerase to transcribe RNA.

It was discovered in 1998 by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, who won the Nobel Prize for their discovery in 2006. The process to silence genes first begins with the entrance of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule into the cell, which triggers the RNAi pathway. The double-stranded molecule is then cut into small double-stranded fragments by an enzyme called Dicer. These small fragments, which include small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), are approximately 21\u201323 nucleotides in length. The fragments integrate into a multi-subunit protein called the RNA-induced silencing complex, which contains Argonaute proteins that are essential components of the RNAi pathway. One strand of the molecule, called the \"guide\" strand, binds to RISC, while the other strand, known as the \"passenger\" strand is degraded. The guide or antisense strand of the fragment that remains bound to RISC directs the sequence-specific silencing of the target mRNA molecule. The genes can be silenced by siRNA molecules that cause the endonucleatic cleavage of the target mRNA molecules or by miRNA molecules that suppress translation of the mRNA molecule. With the cleavage or translational repression of the mRNA molecules, the genes that form them are essentially inactive. RNAi is thought to have evolved as a cellular defense mechanism against invaders, such as RNA viruses, or to combat the proliferation of transposons within a cell's DNA. Both RNA viruses and transposons can exist as double-stranded RNA and lead to the activation of RNAi. Currently, siRNAs are being widely used to suppress specific gene expression and to assess the function of genes. Companies utilizing this approach include Alnylam, Sanofi, Arrowhead, Discerna, and Persomics, among others.",

Several reports suggest that phosphorylation of the 5\u2019-end of a long RNA molecule can influence its immunogenicity, and specifically that 5\u2019-triphosphate RNA, which can be produced during viral infection, is more immunogenic than 5\u2019-diphosphate RNA, 5\u2019-monophosphate RNA or RNA containing no 5\u2019 phosphate. However, in vitro-transcribed (ivT) long RNA containing a 7-methylguanosine cap (present in eukaryotic mRNA) is also highly immunogenic despite having no 5\u2019 phosphate, suggesting that characteristics other than 5\u2019-phosphorylation can influence the immunogenicity of an RNA molecule.",

These units are four types of nucleotides (A,T,G and C) and the sequence of nucleotides stores information in an alphabet called the genetic code. When a gene is read by a cell the DNA sequence is copied into a very similar molecule called RNA (this process is called transcription). Transcription is controlled by other DNA sequences (such as promoters), which show a cell where genes are, and control how often they are copied. The RNA copy made from a gene is then fed through a structure called a ribosome, which translates the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA into the correct sequence of amino acids and joins these amino acids together to make a complete protein chain. The new protein then folds up into its active form. The process of moving information from the language of RNA into the language of amino acids is called translation.",

These piRNAs are expressed mainly in spermatogenic cells in the testes of mammals. However recent studies have reported that piRNA expression can be found in the ovarian somatic cells and neuron cells in invertebrates, as well as in many other mammalian somatic cells. piRNAs have been identified in the genomes of mice, rats, and humans, with an unusual \"clustered\" genomic organization that may originate from repetitive regions of the genome such as retrotransposons or regions normally organized into heterochromatin, and which are normally derived exclusively from the antisense strand of double-stranded RNA. piRNAs have thus been classified as \"repeat-associated small interfering RNAs\" (rasiRNAs). Although their biogenesis is not yet well understood, piRNAs and Piwi proteins are thought to form an endogenous system for silencing the expression of selfish genetic elements such as retrotransposons and thus preventing the gene products of such sequences from interfering with germ cell formation.",

These molecules were only modestly selective and showed unfavorable toxicity levels at relevant therapeutic concentrations. As another strategy for targeting RNA, antisense oligonucleotides were developed which have been pushed forward through the clinic for several diseases. By this principle, if one can identify an RNA involved in disease then the sequence can be used to design a complimentary antisense oligonucleotide, and that agent can be introduced into cells to treat the disease. But, this approach in its basic form has been met with several challenges. The most obvious are their large size and propensity to degradation by nucleases. In order for cellular RNA to be effective it must enter the cells intact. While backbone modifications to antisense oligonucleotides in order to prevent nuclease degradation have been shown to work, this approach is still somewhat limited. Small molecules may present a better way to target RNA and subsequently DNA because they can be designed to be more \u201cdrug-like\u201d and have a better chance of reaching their target, most by oral administration.

As a result of this close phylogeny, the structure of the conserved functional domains is shared between CRD-BP, ZBP1 and the human IMPs (Figure 2). The conserved KH domains are shared throughout the orthologs and they are able to form dimers which orient the RNA binding regions in a polar opposite manner (Figure 3A). This orientation creates room for each G-X-X-G motif (Figure 3B) of each KH domain to bind its RNA transcript (Figure 3A).
