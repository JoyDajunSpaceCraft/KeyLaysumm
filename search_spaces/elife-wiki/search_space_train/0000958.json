            "document": "Malignant transformation . Epigenetic alterations are also carried out by another major regulatory element, the microRNAs. In mammals, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate about 60% of the transcriptional activity of protein-encoding genes. Epigenetic silencing or epigenetic over-expression of miRNA genes, caused by aberrant DNA methylation of the promoter regions controlling their expression, is a frequent event in cancer cells. Almost one third of miRNA promoters active in normal mammary cells were found to be hypermethylated in breast cancer cells, and that is a several fold greater proportion of promoters with altered methylation than is usually observed for protein coding genes. Other microRNA promoters are hypomethylated in breast cancers, and, as a result, these microRNAs are over-expressed. Several of these over-expressed microRNAs have a major influence in progression to breast cancer. BRCA1 is normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where it helps repair damaged DNA, or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired. BRCA1 is involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA1 expression is reduced or undetectable in the majority of high grade, ductal breast cancers. Only about 3%-8% of all women with breast cancer carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. \"BRCA1\" promoter hypermethylation was present in only 13% of unselected primary breast carcinomas. However, breast cancers were found to have an average of about 100-fold increase in miR-182, compared to normal breast tissue. In breast cancer cell lines, there is an inverse correlation of BRCA1 protein levels with miR-182 expression. Thus it appears that much of the reduction or absence of BRCA1 in high grade ductal breast cancers may be due to over-expressed miR-182. (For review see ref.) In addition to miR-182, a pair of almost identical microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b-5p, also repress BRCA1 expression. These two microRNAs are over-expressed in triple-negative tumors and their over-expression results in BRCA1 inactivation. Thus, miR-146a and/or miR-146b-5p may also contribute to reduced expression of BRCA1 in these triple-negative breast cancers.",

            "document": "Chemotherapy . Resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as p-glycoprotein, in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on p-glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of p-glycoprotein are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult. Another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification, a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.",

The two contradicting sides on this subject remained ambiguous and undefined throughout the course of NDPK studies. However, recent experiments began to show evidence for NM23 being a suppressor of metastasis. Nme2 was tagged as an anti-metastasis gene, using the tissue chip technology and immunohistochemistry. When Nme2 gene products were over-produced in gastric cancer cells, there was a decrease in proliferation, migration, and invasion of such cancer cells. The cell cultures revealed that Nme2 impacts gastric cancer cells, but the question still remains about what regulates Nme2 activities among various cancer types. Nme1 was found in great number in poorly metastatic sublines of melanoma cells. Also, the transfection of Nme1 into a highly metastatic melanoma line significantly reduced metastasis. This theory has been tested with mice as well; the Nme1-deficient mice formed greater lung metastases than wild type mice, showing that this gene has suppressing activity. Invasion of cancer occurs due to changes in cell adhesion and it is caused by gene expression changes in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Surprisingly, there are many adhesion molecules, motility factors, signaling pathways, proteolytic events, EMT hallmarks, and other transcriptional programs that have been linked to the Nme1 proteins. These proteins go about interrupting metastasis by binding metastasis-promoting proteins. The Nme1 proteins bind to viral proteins, oncogenes, and other metastasis-promoting factors. The binding may be indirect by using the signaling complex.",

            "document": "Therapeutic index . Radiotherapy aims to minimize the size of tumors and kill cancer cells with high energy. The source of high energy arises from x-rays, gamma rays, charged particles and heavy particles. The therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy for cancer treatment is related to the maximum radiation dose by which death of cancer cells is locally controlled and the minimum radiation dose by which cells in normal tissues have low acute and late morbidity. Both of parameters have sigmoidal dose-response curves. Thus, a favorable outcome in dose-response curve is the response of tumor tissue is greater than that of normal tissue to the same dose, meaning that the treatment is effective to tumors and does not cause serious morbidity to normal tissue. Reversely, overlapping response of two tissues is highly likely to cause serious morbidity to normal tissue and ineffective treatment to tumors. The mechanism of radiation therapy is categorized into direct and indirect radiation. Both of direct and indirect radiations induce DNAs to have a mutation or chromosomal rearrangement during its repair process. Direct radiation creates a free DNA radical from radiation energy deposition that damages DNA. Indirect radiation occurs from radiolysis of water, creating a free hydroxyl radical, hydronium and electron. Then, hydroxyl radical transfers its radical to DNA. Or together with hydronium and electron, a free hydroxyl radical can damage base region of DNA. Cancer cells have imbalance of signals in cell cycle. G1 and G2/M arrest are found to be major checkpoints by irradiation in human cells. G1 arrest delays repair mechanism before synthesis of DNA in S phase and mitosis in M phase, suggesting key checkpoint to lead survival of cells. G2/M arrest occurs when cells need to repair after S phase before the mitotic entry. It was also known that S phase is the most resistant to radiation and M phase was the most sensitive to radiation. p53, a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in G1 and G2/M arrest, enabled the understanding of the cell cycle by radiation. For example, irradiation to myeloid leukemia cell leads to an increase in p53 and a decrease in the level of DNA synthesis. Patients with Ataxia telangiectasia delays have hypersensitivity to radiation due to the delay of accumulation of p53. In this case, cells are able to replicate without repair of their DNA, prone to incidence of cancer. Most cells are in G1 and S phase and irradiation at G2 phase showed increased radiosensitivity and thus G1 arrest has been on focus for therapeutic treatment. Irradiation to a tissue creates response to both irradiated and non-irridiated cells. It was found that even cells up to 50-75 cell diameter distant from irradiated cells have phenotype of enhanced genetic instability such as micronucleation. This suggests the effect of cell-to-cell communication such as paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Normal cells do not lose DNA repair mechanism whereas cancer cells often lose during radiotherapy. However, the nature of high energy radiation can override the ability of damaged normal cell to repair, leading to cause another risk for carcinogenesis. This suggests a significant risk associated with radiation therapy. Thus, it is desirable to improve the therapeutic ratio during radiotherapy. Employing IG-IMRT, protons and heavy ions are likely to minimize dose to normal tissues by altered fractionation. Molecular targeting to DNA repair pathway can lead to radiosensitization or radioprotection. Examples are direct and indirect inhibitors on DNA double-strand breaks. Direct inhibitors target proteins (PARP family) and kinases (ATM, DNA-PKCs) that are involved in DNA repair. Indirect inhibitors target proteins tumor cell signaling proteins such as EGFR and insulin growth factor.",

            "document": "Pancreatic stellate cell . In humans, persistent injury to the pancreas is linked with chronic alcohol use, pancreatic duct obstruction and genetic. Chronic damage leads to the sustained activation of the active PaSC phenotype. Diminished production of MMPs by PaSCs also contributes to the fibrotic phenotype. Other factors may also drive the persistent activated state of PaSCs in the event of pancreatitis. For example, PaSCs express protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), which is cleaved by trypsin to become active. Active PAR-2 then instigates PaSC growth and collagen synthesis. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are recognised by tumour desmoplasia, distinguished by an increase in the connective tissue that surrounds the neoplasm. Activated PaSCs in the tumour desmoplasia of human pancreatic cancers express \u03b1-SMA and co-localise with MRNA encoding pro-collagen \u03b11I. These factors are significant contributors of the ECM proteins that compose the desmoplasia. A symbiotic relationship exists between pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and PaSCs, which leads to an overall increase in the rate of growth of the tumour. For example, culture supernatants from human pancreatic tumour cell lines induce PaSC proliferation and the production of ECM proteins. Pancreatic tumour cells stimulate the proliferation of PaSCs through the secretion of PDGF, and induce PaSC production of ECM proteins by secreting TGF-\u03b21 and FGF-2. Pancreatic tumour cells and PaSCs operate in a symbiotic relationship in animal studies, however data from human pancreatic tumours is limited. Connective tissue growth factor is involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases and is predominantly found in PaSCs through regulation by TGF-\u03b2. Pancreatic cancer cells also stimulate proliferation, ECM production and TIMP1 production in PaSCs. The production of these factors is regulated by fibroblast growth factor 2, TGF-\u03b21, and PDGF. In addition to cytokine-mediated mechanisms, PaSCs also produce a tumour supportive micro-environment through the production of matri-cellular proteins. The up regulation of matri-cellular proteins such as galectin-1, and tenascin-C is present in the stromal tissues of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Matricellular proteins induce proliferation, migration and production of cytokines, ECM and angiogenic responses in PaSCs, which in turn induce cancer cell proliferation. Matri-cellular proteins may therefore directly contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer through stimulating cancer cell activity. The matricellular protein also facilitates a tumour supportive microenvironment through sustained fibrogenic stellate cell activity. A hypoxic environment in tumours influences pancreatic cancer progression. An oxygen deficient environment concomitantly exists not only in cancer cells but also in surrounding pancreatic stellate cells. The cellular response to hypoxia is mediated by the transcription factor HIF-1, which is a heterodimer protein composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Hypoxia also stimulates nuclear expression of HIF-1\u03b1 followed by the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PaSCs. The induction of HIF-\u03b1 indicates that PaSCs serves as oxygen sensing cells within the pancreas. PaSCs, endothelial cells and other cells involved in the development of pancreatic fibrosis therefore function in coordination with a low oxygen microenvironment. Treatment of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer aims to target the major mechanisms involved in both their activation and proliferation. For example, inhibition of the receptors PDGF, TGF-\u03b2 and angiotensin II in addition to suppression of the intracellular signalling pathways downstream of these receptors is likely to be of therapeutic benefit. In vitro experiments indicate that PaSCs influence the activation and proliferation process for mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, in particular ERK1/2, p38 kinase and JNK. The inhibition of the majority of MAPK pathways leads to a reduction in the activation and proliferation of PaSCs. Anti-fibrosis treatment strategies targeting PaSCs include inhibition of the activation of quiescent PaSCs. Agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, serine protease inhibitors and adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibit the activation and function of PaSCs. Camostat mesilate, an oral protease inhibitor, that is used to treat patients with chronic pancreatitis inhibited the proliferation and MCP-1 production in PaSCs in vitro. The success and effect of anti-fibrosis therapies in pancreatic cancer treatment, however, remains unclear. Rat PaSCs express COX-2 when stimulated with TGF beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) and other cytokines. pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 and inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway decreases the expression of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA and collagen I, indicating that COX-2 may be a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Strategies aimed at inducing PaSC transformation from an activated to a quiescent state and inducing PaSC apoptosis may also be used to treat pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. For example, the administration of vitamin A induces culture activated rat PaSCs to trans-differentiate to a quiescent state, preventing the progression of pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis.",

            "document": "Pancreatic stellate cell . While the discovery of hepatic stellate cells is attributed to Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer in 1876, who had termed them \u201cstellate cells\u201d, the original discovery is attributed to more than one research group. The first documented observations of PaSCs were recorded by Watari et al. in 1982. Watari observed the pancreas of vitamin A primed mice using fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Cells displaying fading blue-green fluorescence typical of vitamin A in the periacinar region of pancreas was observed. Watari likened these cells to hepatic stellate cells. The publication of two seminal research papers in 1998 outlining the isolation of these cells provided an in vitro method by which researchers may characterise PaSCs in both health and pathology. PaSCs are located within the peri-acinar spaces of the pancreas and extrude long cytoplasmic processes that surround the base of the acinus. PaSCs compose 4-7% of the total cell mass in the gland Stellate cells derive their name from their star shape and are located in other organs such as the kidney and lungs. The cells are located in periductal and perivascular regions of the pancreas and contain vitamin A lipid droplets in their cytoplasm. PaSCs engage in disease pathogenesis by transforming from a quiescent state into an activated state, which is also known as a \u201cmyofibroblastic\u201d state. PaSCs express the intermediate filament proteins desmin and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The expression of a diverse range of intermediate filament proteins enables the PaSC to harbour contractile abilities. Cellular extensions also enable the cells to sense their environment. Following inflammation or injury to the pancreas, quiescent PaSCs are activated to myofibroblast like cells, which expresses \u03b1- smooth muscle actin. Several morphological changes take place including nuclear enlargement and increased growth of the endoplasmic reticulum network. The activated PaSCs then grow in number, migrate and secrete extracellular matrix components such as type I collagen, chemokines and cytokines. Quiescent PaSCs produce metalloproteinases such as MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 and their inhibitors, which assist in the turnover of the extracellular matrix (ECM). As a result of regulating ECM turnover, PaSCs are involved in the maintenance of the modelling of normal tissue. MMP-2 secreted by PaSCs, however, contributes to the development of pancreatic cancer. Fibrosis is a prominent feature of chronic pancreatitis and of the desmoplastic reaction linked with pancreatic cancer. While the pathogenesis of fibrosis remains elusive, the activation of stellate cells contribute to pancreatic fibrosis. Numerous soluble factors regulate PaSC activation, specifically IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-B1 and activin 1. The potential sources of these activating factors include platelets, macrophages, pancreatic acinar cells and endothelial cells in inflamed pancreas. PaSCs, individually, are also capable of synthesising cytokines such as TGF-\u03b21, activin A and IL-1. The production of these factors indicates the presence of autocrine loops that perpetuate PaSC activation, promoting the development of fibrosis. Protein kinases such as MAPKs are primary mediators of activating signals initiated by the growth factors, angiotensin II and ethanol. Other signalling pathways regulating PaSC activation include PI3K, RHO kinase and TGF-\u03b2/SMAD-related pathways. Following activation, PaSCs migrate to areas of tissue damage and contract, phagocytose, and induce products that regulate the ECM through facilitating repair or by promoting fibrosis. The migration of PaSCs is modulated by Indian hedgehog (IHH), a peptide that is involved in pancreatic development, patterning and differentiation. Stellate cells express smoothened (Smo) and patched-1 (Ptch1) proteins, which are significant features of the hedgehog receptor system. Indian Hedgehog binding results in relocation of the transcriptional of transcription factor Gli-1 into the nucleus, inducing chemokinetic migration of PaSCs. Following activation, PaSCs have two fates. If there is sustained inflammation and injury, PaSC activation is perpetuated, resulting in the growth of pancreatic fibrosis. The activation of P2 receptors induces intracellular calcium signalling which mediates the fibrogenic function of activated stellate cells. However, if inflammation and injury is minor, PaSCs undergo an apoptotic fate and become quiescent, preventing the development of fibrosis. PaSCs also display ethanol inducible ADH activity. The possibility that pancreatic stellate cells may be exposed to ethanol and acetaldehyde during ethanol consumption is likely, as the pancreas metabolise ethanol to acetaldehyde through the oxidative pathway. PaSCs are activated upon exposure to ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde or to oxidant stress. Ethanol at clinically relevant concentrations causes \u03b1-SMA expression and collagen production in PaSCs but produce a minimal effect on cell proliferation. Increased \u03b1-SMA expression in stellate cells exposed to ethanol suggests activation and transformation of the cells to a myofibroblast phenotype. Incubation of PaSCs with ethanol in the presence of ADH inhibitor 4MP had inhibited the increase in collagen synthesis induced by ethanol. The conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde via ADH is a significant step in the ethanol induced activation of pancreatic stellate cells. Pancreatitis is generally classified into two forms, acute and chronic. In acute pancreatitis, necroinflammation of the organ occurs, while chronic pancreatitis is distinguished by the progressive loss of endocrine and exocrine function. After pancreatic damage occurs, pathologic events such as interstitial oedema, necrosis of parenchymal cells, activation and proliferation of PaSCs take place. Inflammation and parenchymal necrosis precede PaSC activation. Activated PaSCs are located in areas of major necrosis and inflammation that harbour cytokines, growth factors and reactive oxygen species. Inflammatory processes are essential in contributing towards the activation of stellate cells. Therefore, both autocrine and paracrine mediators are involved pancreatic stellate cell activation. Copious amounts of \u03b1- SMA-expressing cells are present in fibrotic areas of pancreatic tissue sections in patients with chronic pancreatitis. \u03b1-SMA-expressing cells in fibrotic areas yield MRNA encoding pro-collagen \u03b11I, indicating that activated PaSCs are the predominant source of collagen in pancreatic fibrosis. Activated PaSCs and other myo-fibroblast cells contribute to the formation of a provisional matrix at the injury site, which enables cell proliferation, migration and the assembly of new parenchymal cells. In the majority of cases, activated PaSCs recede after the termination of the injurious agent, however repeated pancreatic damage can result in proliferation of PaSCs and eventual fibrosis.",

In normal cells, conditions such as this would be corrected by mechanisms designed to prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells, internal or external, and would result in apoptosis should the cell be unable to repair the damage. In cancerous cells, by some mechanism or other, the ability of the cell to control its own growth is impeded and external mechanisms designed to kill abnormal cells do not function. One system particularly important in the proliferation of cancers is the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, system. These proteins have functions that are not related to mitogenesis, but can be triggered by mitogens and do control the cell cycle. MAPK proteins are capable of controlling the cell cycle either to prevent or encourage the growth of cells. The MAPK pathway can be triggered by many ligands, including hormones and growth factors. Some breast cancer types have very high MAPK activity, which is not found even in benign breast tumors. The overexpression of MAP kinase in these cells aids in their proliferation.

Within this protein-coding DNA (called the exome), an average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein altering mutations, of which about 3 or 4 may be \"driver\" mutations, and the remaining ones may be \"passenger\" mutations. However, the average number of DNA sequence mutations in the entire genome (including non-protein-coding regions) within a breast cancer tissue sample is about 20,000. In an average melanoma tissue sample (where melanomas have a higher exome mutation frequency) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000. These high frequencies of mutations in the total nucleotide sequences within cancers suggest that often an early alteration in the field defect giving rise to a cancer (e.g. yellow area in the diagram in the preceding section) is a deficiency in DNA repair. Large field defects surrounding colon cancers (extending to about 10\u00a0cm on each side of a cancer) are found to frequently have epigenetic defects in 2 or 3 DNA repair proteins (ERCC1, XPF and/or PMS2) in the entire area of the field defect. When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damages accumulate in cells at a higher than normal level, and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation. Mutation rates strongly increase in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR). A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone translesion synthesis past some of those damages may give rise to mutations. In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to epimutations. These new mutations and/or epimutations may provide a proliferative advantage, generating a field defect. Although the mutations/epimutations in DNA repair genes do not, themselves, confer a selective advantage, they may be carried along as passengers in cells when the cell acquires an additional mutation/epimutation that does provide a proliferative advantage.",

Some miRNAs also undergo methylation-associated silencing in cancer cells. Let-7 and miR15/16 play important roles in down-regulating RAS and BCL2 oncogenes, and their silencing occurs in cancer cells. Decreased expression of miR-125b1, a miRNA that functions as a tumor suppressor, was observed in prostate, ovarian, breast and glial cell cancers. In vitro experiments have shown that miR-125b1 targets two genes, HER2/neu and ESR1, that are linked to breast cancer. DNA methylation, specifically hypermethylation, is one of the main ways that the miR-125b1 is epigenetically silenced. In patients with breast cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands located proximal to the transcription start site was observed. Loss of CTCF binding and an increase in repressive histone marks, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, correlates with DNA methylation and miR-125b1 silencing. Mechanistically, CTCF may function as a boundary element to stop the spread of DNA methylation. Results from experiments conducted by Soto-Reyes et al. indicate a negative effect of methylation on the function and expression of miR-125b1. Therefore, they concluded that DNA methylation has a part in silencing the gene. Furthermore, some miRNA's are epigenetically silenced early on in breast cancer, and therefore these miRNA's could potentially be useful as tumor markers. The epigenetic silencing of miRNA genes by aberrant DNA methylation is a frequent event in cancer cells; almost one third of miRNA promoters active in normal mammary cells were found hypermethylated in breast cancer cells - that is a several fold greater proportion than is usually observed for protein coding genes.  DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms).",

Normally, once a tissue is injured or infected, damaged cells elicit inflammation, by stimulating specific patterns of enzyme activity and cytokine gene expression on surrounding cells. Discrete clusters of molecules are secreted, which act as mediators, inducing the activity of subsequent cascades of biochemical changes. Each cytokine binds to specific receptors on various cell types, and each cell type responds differently by altering the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways, depending on the receptors that the cell expresses and the signaling molecules present inside the cell. Collectively, this reprogramming process induces a stepwise change in cell phenotypes, which will ultimately lead to restoration of tissue function and toward regaining essential structural integrity. A tissue can thereby heal, depending on the productive communication between the cells present at the site of damage, and the immune system. Key factor in healing is the regulation of cytokine gene expression, which enables complementary groups of cells to respond to inflammatory mediators in a manner that gradually produces essential changes in tissue physiology. Cancer cells have either permanent (genetic) or reversible (epigenetic) changes on their genome, which partly inhibit their communication with surrounding cells and with the immune system. Cancer cells do not communicate with their tissue microenvironment in a manner that protects tissue integrity; instead, the movement and the survival of cancer cells become possible in locations where they can impair tissue function.

Given these properties of DNA damage and mutation, it can be seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) are synthetic antisense oligonucleotides to the mRNA of the gene of interest that works to silence the expression of a particular gene by its complementary binding. siRNAs, such as LY2181308, bound to the respective mRNA results in disruption of translation of that particular gene and thus the absence of that protein in the cell. Thus, the use of siRNAs has great potential to be a human therapeutic, as it can target and silence the expression of potentially any protein you want. A problem arises when siRNA expression in a cell cannot be controlled, allowing its constitutive expression to cause toxic side-effects. With regard to practical treatment of cancer, it is required to either deliver the siRNAs specifically into cancer cells or control the siRNA expression. Previous methods of siRNA therapy employ the use of siRNA sequences cloned into vectors under the control of constitutively active promoters. This causes a problem, as this model is non-specific to cancer cells and damages normal cells too. Knowing that survivin is over-expressed specifically in cancer cells and absent in normal cells, one can imply that the survivin promoter is active only in cancer cells. Thus, the exploitation of this difference between cancer cells and normal cells will allow appropriate therapy directed only at the cells in a patient that are harmful. In an experiment to demonstrate this idea, Trang et al. have created a cancer-specific vector expressing siRNA for green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the human survivin promoter. MCF7 breast cancer cells were cotransfected with this vector and a GFP-expressing vector as well. Their major finding was that MCF7 cells transfected with the siRNA vector for GFP under the survivin promoter had a significant reduction in GFP expression then the cells transfected with the siRNA vector under a cancer non-specific promoter. Moreover, normal non-cancerous cells transfected in the same way mentioned above showed no significant reduction in GFP expression. This is implying that, in normal cells, survivin promoter is not active, and, thus, the siRNA will not be expressed under an inactive survivin promoter.",

While the discovery of hepatic stellate cells is attributed to Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer in 1876, who had termed them \u201cstellate cells\u201d, the original discovery is attributed to more than one research group. The first documented observations of PaSCs were recorded by Watari et al. in 1982. Watari observed the pancreas of vitamin A primed mice using fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Cells displaying fading blue-green fluorescence typical of vitamin A in the periacinar region of pancreas was observed. Watari likened these cells to hepatic stellate cells. The publication of two seminal research papers in 1998 outlining the isolation of these cells provided an in vitro method by which researchers may characterise PaSCs in both health and pathology. PaSCs are located within the peri-acinar spaces of the pancreas and extrude long cytoplasmic processes that surround the base of the acinus. PaSCs compose 4-7% of the total cell mass in the gland Stellate cells derive their name from their star shape and are located in other organs such as the kidney and lungs. The cells are located in periductal and perivascular regions of the pancreas and contain vitamin A lipid droplets in their cytoplasm. PaSCs engage in disease pathogenesis by transforming from a quiescent state into an activated state, which is also known as a \u201cmyofibroblastic\u201d state. PaSCs express the intermediate filament proteins desmin and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The expression of a diverse range of intermediate filament proteins enables the PaSC to harbour contractile abilities. Cellular extensions also enable the cells to sense their environment. Following inflammation or injury to the pancreas, quiescent PaSCs are activated to myofibroblast like cells, which expresses \u03b1- smooth muscle actin. Several morphological changes take place including nuclear enlargement and increased growth of the endoplasmic reticulum network. The activated PaSCs then grow in number, migrate and secrete extracellular matrix components such as type I collagen, chemokines and cytokines. Quiescent PaSCs produce metalloproteinases such as MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 and their inhibitors, which assist in the turnover of the extracellular matrix (ECM). As a result of regulating ECM turnover, PaSCs are involved in the maintenance of the modelling of normal tissue. MMP-2 secreted by PaSCs, however, contributes to the development of pancreatic cancer. Fibrosis is a prominent feature of chronic pancreatitis and of the desmoplastic reaction linked with pancreatic cancer. While the pathogenesis of fibrosis remains elusive, the activation of stellate cells contribute to pancreatic fibrosis. Numerous soluble factors regulate PaSC activation, specifically IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-B1 and activin 1. The potential sources of these activating factors include platelets, macrophages, pancreatic acinar cells and endothelial cells in inflamed pancreas. PaSCs, individually, are also capable of synthesising cytokines such as TGF-\u03b21, activin A and IL-1. The production of these factors indicates the presence of autocrine loops that perpetuate PaSC activation, promoting the development of fibrosis. Protein kinases such as MAPKs are primary mediators of activating signals initiated by the growth factors, angiotensin II and ethanol. Other signalling pathways regulating PaSC activation include PI3K, RHO kinase and TGF-\u03b2/SMAD-related pathways. Following activation, PaSCs migrate to areas of tissue damage and contract, phagocytose, and induce products that regulate the ECM through facilitating repair or by promoting fibrosis. The migration of PaSCs is modulated by Indian hedgehog (IHH), a peptide that is involved in pancreatic development, patterning and differentiation. Stellate cells express smoothened (Smo) and patched-1 (Ptch1) proteins, which are significant features of the hedgehog receptor system. Indian Hedgehog binding results in relocation of the transcriptional of transcription factor Gli-1 into the nucleus, inducing chemokinetic migration of PaSCs. Following activation, PaSCs have two fates. If there is sustained inflammation and injury, PaSC activation is perpetuated, resulting in the growth of pancreatic fibrosis. The activation of P2 receptors induces intracellular calcium signalling which mediates the fibrogenic function of activated stellate cells. However, if inflammation and injury is minor, PaSCs undergo an apoptotic fate and become quiescent, preventing the development of fibrosis. PaSCs also display ethanol inducible ADH activity. The possibility that pancreatic stellate cells may be exposed to ethanol and acetaldehyde during ethanol consumption is likely, as the pancreas metabolise ethanol to acetaldehyde through the oxidative pathway. PaSCs are activated upon exposure to ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde or to oxidant stress. Ethanol at clinically relevant concentrations causes \u03b1-SMA expression and collagen production in PaSCs but produce a minimal effect on cell proliferation. Increased \u03b1-SMA expression in stellate cells exposed to ethanol suggests activation and transformation of the cells to a myofibroblast phenotype. Incubation of PaSCs with ethanol in the presence of ADH inhibitor 4MP had inhibited the increase in collagen synthesis induced by ethanol. The conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde via ADH is a significant step in the ethanol induced activation of pancreatic stellate cells. Pancreatitis is generally classified into two forms, acute and chronic. In acute pancreatitis, necroinflammation of the organ occurs, while chronic pancreatitis is distinguished by the progressive loss of endocrine and exocrine function. After pancreatic damage occurs, pathologic events such as interstitial oedema, necrosis of parenchymal cells, activation and proliferation of PaSCs take place. Inflammation and parenchymal necrosis precede PaSC activation. Activated PaSCs are located in areas of major necrosis and inflammation that harbour cytokines, growth factors and reactive oxygen species. Inflammatory processes are essential in contributing towards the activation of stellate cells. Therefore, both autocrine and paracrine mediators are involved pancreatic stellate cell activation. Copious amounts of \u03b1- SMA-expressing cells are present in fibrotic areas of pancreatic tissue sections in patients with chronic pancreatitis. \u03b1-SMA-expressing cells in fibrotic areas yield MRNA encoding pro-collagen \u03b11I, indicating that activated PaSCs are the predominant source of collagen in pancreatic fibrosis. Activated PaSCs and other myo-fibroblast cells contribute to the formation of a provisional matrix at the injury site, which enables cell proliferation, migration and the assembly of new parenchymal cells. In the majority of cases, activated PaSCs recede after the termination of the injurious agent, however repeated pancreatic damage can result in proliferation of PaSCs and eventual fibrosis.",

The source of high energy arises from x-rays, gamma rays, charged particles and heavy particles. The therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy for cancer treatment is related to the maximum radiation dose by which death of cancer cells is locally controlled and the minimum radiation dose by which cells in normal tissues have low acute and late morbidity. Both of parameters have sigmoidal dose-response curves. Thus, a favorable outcome in dose-response curve is the response of tumor tissue is greater than that of normal tissue to the same dose, meaning that the treatment is effective to tumors and does not cause serious morbidity to normal tissue. Reversely, overlapping response of two tissues is highly likely to cause serious morbidity to normal tissue and ineffective treatment to tumors. The mechanism of radiation therapy is categorized into direct and indirect radiation. Both of direct and indirect radiations induce DNAs to have a mutation or chromosomal rearrangement during its repair process. Direct radiation creates a free DNA radical from radiation energy deposition that damages DNA. Indirect radiation occurs from radiolysis of water, creating a free hydroxyl radical, hydronium and electron. Then, hydroxyl radical transfers its radical to DNA. Or together with hydronium and electron, a free hydroxyl radical can damage base region of DNA. Cancer cells have imbalance of signals in cell cycle. G1 and G2/M arrest are found to be major checkpoints by irradiation in human cells. G1 arrest delays repair mechanism before synthesis of DNA in S phase and mitosis in M phase, suggesting key checkpoint to lead survival of cells. G2/M arrest occurs when cells need to repair after S phase before the mitotic entry. It was also known that S phase is the most resistant to radiation and M phase was the most sensitive to radiation. p53, a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in G1 and G2/M arrest, enabled the understanding of the cell cycle by radiation. For example, irradiation to myeloid leukemia cell leads to an increase in p53 and a decrease in the level of DNA synthesis. Patients with Ataxia telangiectasia delays have hypersensitivity to radiation due to the delay of accumulation of p53. In this case, cells are able to replicate without repair of their DNA, prone to incidence of cancer. Most cells are in G1 and S phase and irradiation at G2 phase showed increased radiosensitivity and thus G1 arrest has been on focus for therapeutic treatment. Irradiation to a tissue creates response to both irradiated and non-irridiated cells. It was found that even cells up to 50-75 cell diameter distant from irradiated cells have phenotype of enhanced genetic instability such as micronucleation. This suggests the effect of cell-to-cell communication such as paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Normal cells do not lose DNA repair mechanism whereas cancer cells often lose during radiotherapy. However, the nature of high energy radiation can override the ability of damaged normal cell to repair, leading to cause another risk for carcinogenesis. This suggests a significant risk associated with radiation therapy. Thus, it is desirable to improve the therapeutic ratio during radiotherapy. Employing IG-IMRT, protons and heavy ions are likely to minimize dose to normal tissues by altered fractionation. Molecular targeting to DNA repair pathway can lead to radiosensitization or radioprotection. Examples are direct and indirect inhibitors on DNA double-strand breaks. Direct inhibitors target proteins (PARP family) and kinases (ATM, DNA-PKCs) that are involved in DNA repair. Indirect inhibitors target proteins tumor cell signaling proteins such as EGFR and insulin growth factor.",

            "document": "Pancreatic stellate cell . In humans, persistent injury to the pancreas is linked with chronic alcohol use, pancreatic duct obstruction and genetic. Chronic damage leads to the sustained activation of the active PaSC phenotype. Diminished production of MMPs by PaSCs also contributes to the fibrotic phenotype. Other factors may also drive the persistent activated state of PaSCs in the event of pancreatitis. For example, PaSCs express protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), which is cleaved by trypsin to become active. Active PAR-2 then instigates PaSC growth and collagen synthesis. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are recognised by tumour desmoplasia, distinguished by an increase in the connective tissue that surrounds the neoplasm. Activated PaSCs in the tumour desmoplasia of human pancreatic cancers express \u03b1-SMA and co-localise with MRNA encoding pro-collagen \u03b11I. These factors are significant contributors of the ECM proteins that compose the desmoplasia. A symbiotic relationship exists between pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and PaSCs, which leads to an overall increase in the rate of growth of the tumour. For example, culture supernatants from human pancreatic tumour cell lines induce PaSC proliferation and the production of ECM proteins. Pancreatic tumour cells stimulate the proliferation of PaSCs through the secretion of PDGF, and induce PaSC production of ECM proteins by secreting TGF-\u03b21 and FGF-2. Pancreatic tumour cells and PaSCs operate in a symbiotic relationship in animal studies, however data from human pancreatic tumours is limited. Connective tissue growth factor is involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases and is predominantly found in PaSCs through regulation by TGF-\u03b2. Pancreatic cancer cells also stimulate proliferation, ECM production and TIMP1 production in PaSCs. The production of these factors is regulated by fibroblast growth factor 2, TGF-\u03b21, and PDGF. In addition to cytokine-mediated mechanisms, PaSCs also produce a tumour supportive micro-environment through the production of matri-cellular proteins. The up regulation of matri-cellular proteins such as galectin-1, and tenascin-C is present in the stromal tissues of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Matricellular proteins induce proliferation, migration and production of cytokines, ECM and angiogenic responses in PaSCs, which in turn induce cancer cell proliferation. Matri-cellular proteins may therefore directly contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer through stimulating cancer cell activity. The matricellular protein also facilitates a tumour supportive microenvironment through sustained fibrogenic stellate cell activity. A hypoxic environment in tumours influences pancreatic cancer progression. An oxygen deficient environment concomitantly exists not only in cancer cells but also in surrounding pancreatic stellate cells. The cellular response to hypoxia is mediated by the transcription factor HIF-1, which is a heterodimer protein composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Hypoxia also stimulates nuclear expression of HIF-1\u03b1 followed by the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PaSCs. The induction of HIF-\u03b1 indicates that PaSCs serves as oxygen sensing cells within the pancreas. PaSCs, endothelial cells and other cells involved in the development of pancreatic fibrosis therefore function in coordination with a low oxygen microenvironment. Treatment of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer aims to target the major mechanisms involved in both their activation and proliferation. For example, inhibition of the receptors PDGF, TGF-\u03b2 and angiotensin II in addition to suppression of the intracellular signalling pathways downstream of these receptors is likely to be of therapeutic benefit. In vitro experiments indicate that PaSCs influence the activation and proliferation process for mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, in particular ERK1/2, p38 kinase and JNK. The inhibition of the majority of MAPK pathways leads to a reduction in the activation and proliferation of PaSCs. Anti-fibrosis treatment strategies targeting PaSCs include inhibition of the activation of quiescent PaSCs. Agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, serine protease inhibitors and adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibit the activation and function of PaSCs. Camostat mesilate, an oral protease inhibitor, that is used to treat patients with chronic pancreatitis inhibited the proliferation and MCP-1 production in PaSCs in vitro. The success and effect of anti-fibrosis therapies in pancreatic cancer treatment, however, remains unclear. Rat PaSCs express COX-2 when stimulated with TGF beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) and other cytokines. pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 and inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway decreases the expression of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA and collagen I, indicating that COX-2 may be a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Strategies aimed at inducing PaSC transformation from an activated to a quiescent state and inducing PaSC apoptosis may also be used to treat pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. For example, the administration of vitamin A induces culture activated rat PaSCs to trans-differentiate to a quiescent state, preventing the progression of pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis.",

Normally, once a tissue is injured or infected, damaged cells elicit inflammation, by stimulating specific patterns of enzyme activity and cytokine gene expression on surrounding cells. Discrete clusters of molecules are secreted, which act as mediators, inducing the activity of subsequent cascades of biochemical changes. Each cytokine binds to specific receptors on various cell types, and each cell type responds differently by altering the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways, depending on the receptors that the cell expresses and the signaling molecules present inside the cell. Collectively, this reprogramming process induces a stepwise change in cell phenotypes, which will ultimately lead to restoration of tissue function and toward regaining essential structural integrity. A tissue can thereby heal, depending on the productive communication between the cells present at the site of damage, and the immune system. Key factor in healing is the regulation of cytokine gene expression, which enables complementary groups of cells to respond to inflammatory mediators in a manner that gradually produces essential changes in tissue physiology. Cancer cells have either permanent (genetic) or reversible (epigenetic) changes on their genome, which partly inhibit their communication with surrounding cells and with the immune system. Cancer cells do not communicate with their tissue microenvironment in a manner that protects tissue integrity; instead, the movement and the survival of cancer cells become possible in locations where they can impair tissue function.

Although both RhoA and RhoC proteins comprise a significant part of the Rho GTPases that are linked to promoting the invasive behavior of breast carcinomas, attributing specific functions to these individual members has been difficult. We have used a stable retroviral RNA interference approach to generate invasive breast carcinoma cells (SUM-159 cells) that lack either RhoA or RhoC expression. Analysis of these cells enabled us to deduce that RhoA impedes and RhoC stimulates invasion. Unexpectedly, this analysis also revealed a compensatory relationship between RhoA and RhoC at the level of both their expression and activation, and a reciprocal relationship between RhoA and Rac1 activation. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a stem cell disorder that prevents myeloid cells from functioning correctly, has been linked to actin polymerization. Signaling proteins like RhoA, regulate polymerization of actin. Due to differences proteins exhibited between normal and affected neutrocytes, RhoA has become the key element; further experimentation has also shown that RhoA-inhibiting pathways prevent the overall growth of CML cells. As a result, RhoA has significant potential as a therapeutic target in gene therapy techniques to treating CML.

In normal cells, TGF-\u03b2, acting through its signaling pathway, stops the cell cycle at the G1 stage to stop proliferation, induce differentiation, or promote apoptosis. In many cancer cells, parts of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway are mutated, and TGF-\u03b2 no longer controls the cell. These cancer cells proliferate. The surrounding stromal cells (fibroblasts) also proliferate. Both cells increase their production of TGF-\u03b2. This TGF-\u03b2 acts on the surrounding stromal cells, immune cells, endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. It causes immunosuppression and angiogenesis, which makes the cancer more invasive. TGF-\u03b2 also converts effector T-cells, which normally attack cancer with an inflammatory (immune) reaction, into regulatory (suppressor) T-cells, which turn off the inflammatory reaction. Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between different cell types that express adhesion molecules and secrete cytokines. Disruption of these feedback mechanisms in cancer damages a tissue. When TGF-\u03b2 signaling fails to control NF-\u03baB activity in cancer cells, this has at least two potential effects: first, it enables the malignant tumor to persist in the presence of activated immune cells, and second, the cancer cell outlasts immune cells because it survives in the presence of apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory mediators.",

Mitogens can contribute to this by causing the cell cycle to move forward when it should be prevented by some mechanism. In normal cells, conditions such as this would be corrected by mechanisms designed to prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells, internal or external, and would result in apoptosis should the cell be unable to repair the damage. In cancerous cells, by some mechanism or other, the ability of the cell to control its own growth is impeded and external mechanisms designed to kill abnormal cells do not function. One system particularly important in the proliferation of cancers is the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, system. These proteins have functions that are not related to mitogenesis, but can be triggered by mitogens and do control the cell cycle. MAPK proteins are capable of controlling the cell cycle either to prevent or encourage the growth of cells. The MAPK pathway can be triggered by many ligands, including hormones and growth factors.

There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as p-glycoprotein, in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on p-glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of p-glycoprotein are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult. Another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification, a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.",

The protein made by the \"APC\" gene plays a critical role in several cellular processes that determine whether a cell may develop into a tumor. The APC protein helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, how the cell polarizes and the morphogenesis of the 3D structures, or whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the chromosome number in cells produced through cell division is correct. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. The activity of one protein in particular, beta-catenin, is controlled by the APC protein (see: Wnt signaling pathway). Regulation of beta-catenin prevents genes that stimulate cell division from being turned on too often and prevents cell overgrowth.",

Synthetic lethal analysis can be used to elucidate mechanisms of known chemotherapeutic drugs by identifying genes whose function is necessary for drug function. For example, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are important for repairing double-strand breaks in DNA, and mutations in these genes predispose individuals to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The enzyme PARP1 is involved in repairing single-strand breaks, and the inhibition of PARP1 in a BRCA mutant background is selectively lethal to tumors because cancer cells accumulate DNA lesions that they cannot repair. Synthetic lethality is also useful for screening libraries of molecules to detect drugs that selectively inhibit cancer cells. In a recent chemical-genetic screen, one compound of 3200 screened molecules was a synthetic lethal inhibitor of pancreatic cancer KRAS gain-of-function cells, which suggests a potential treatment for this cancer type.",

            "document": "KRAS . KRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch, using protein dynamics. Once it is allosterically activated, it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of growth factors, as well as other cell signaling receptors like c-Raf and PI 3-kinase. KRAS upregulates the GLUT1 glucose transporter, thereby contributing to the Warburg effect in cancer cells. KRAS binds to GTP in its active state. It also possesses an intrinsic enzymatic activity which cleaves the terminal phosphate of the nucleotide, converting it to GDP. Upon conversion of GTP to GDP, KRAS is deactivated. The rate of conversion is usually slow, but can be increased dramatically by an accessory protein of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) class, for example RasGAP. In turn, KRAS can bind to proteins of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) class (such as SOS1), which forces the release of bound nucleotide (GDP). Subsequently, KRAS binds GTP present in the cytosol and the GEF is released from ras-GTP.",

            "document": "SULF1 . Sulf1 mRNA expression in pancreatic cancer differed from ovarian and liver cancer. Only 50% of pancreatic cancer cell lines tested exhibited a significant decrease in Sulf1. Further, in situ hybridization demonstrated that Sulf1 mRNA expression was not uniformly absent in pancreatic cancer tissue. In fact, Sulf1 was present weakly in normal acinar cells, but present at high levels in the endothelium and malignant cells in pancreatic cancer tissue (Li, Kleeff et al. 2005). This indicates that downregulation of Sulf1 is not a ubiquitous process in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, endogenous expression of Sulf1 in a Sulf1-negative pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1, inhibited FGF-2 signaling, but did not affect HB-EGF, EGF, or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling, indicating cell specific effects. In further contrast to ovarian cancer and HCC, Hsulf-1 expressing Panc-1 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine, suggesting Hsulf-1 over-expression might confer increased chemoresistance, and therefore a growth advantage, to pancreatic cancer cells. In further reports Sulf1 displays a complicated expression pattern in pancreatic cancer that is more than merely up or downregulation. For instance, primary pancreatic cancer show higher sulfated HSPGs indicating a lack of Sulf1, but upon metastasis sulfation of HSPGs is reduced. Corroborating patient data were mouse tumor in vivo studies of Sulf1 overexpressing Panc-1 cells showing decreased growth, but increased local invasiveness.",

            "document": "Malignant transformation . Epigenetic alterations are also carried out by another major regulatory element, the microRNAs. In mammals, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate about 60% of the transcriptional activity of protein-encoding genes. Epigenetic silencing or epigenetic over-expression of miRNA genes, caused by aberrant DNA methylation of the promoter regions controlling their expression, is a frequent event in cancer cells. Almost one third of miRNA promoters active in normal mammary cells were found to be hypermethylated in breast cancer cells, and that is a several fold greater proportion of promoters with altered methylation than is usually observed for protein coding genes. Other microRNA promoters are hypomethylated in breast cancers, and, as a result, these microRNAs are over-expressed. Several of these over-expressed microRNAs have a major influence in progression to breast cancer. BRCA1 is normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where it helps repair damaged DNA, or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired. BRCA1 is involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA1 expression is reduced or undetectable in the majority of high grade, ductal breast cancers. Only about 3%-8% of all women with breast cancer carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. \"BRCA1\" promoter hypermethylation was present in only 13% of unselected primary breast carcinomas. However, breast cancers were found to have an average of about 100-fold increase in miR-182, compared to normal breast tissue. In breast cancer cell lines, there is an inverse correlation of BRCA1 protein levels with miR-182 expression. Thus it appears that much of the reduction or absence of BRCA1 in high grade ductal breast cancers may be due to over-expressed miR-182. (For review see ref.) In addition to miR-182, a pair of almost identical microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b-5p, also repress BRCA1 expression. These two microRNAs are over-expressed in triple-negative tumors and their over-expression results in BRCA1 inactivation. Thus, miR-146a and/or miR-146b-5p may also contribute to reduced expression of BRCA1 in these triple-negative breast cancers.",
