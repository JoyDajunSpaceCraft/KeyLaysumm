Ubiquitin plays a role in the regulation of other proteins by tagging them for eventual degradation by proteasomes. This process begins when \"ubiquitin ligase\" covalently attaches a ubiquitin molecule to the lysine side chain of the target protein substrate (the misfolded, damaged, malfunctioning or unneeded protein that needs to be degraded). This is repeated a number of times in succession forming a chain of ubiquitin molecules, which is a process referred to as polyubiquitination. The polyubiquitination of the target protein signals the proteasome to break it down, which it does via proteolysis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a crucial role in the non-lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins, and ubiquitin can also participate in modifying proteins to perform certain tasks. Both degradation and modification of proteins within the cell are part of a broader regulatory scheme, necessary for cellular processes such as cell division, cell signalling, cell surface receptor function, apoptosis, DNA maintenance, inflammatory response and developmental quality control associated with the cell cycle and homeostasis in general.",

When proteins are determined to be unfolded or misfolded, they are typically degraded via the unfolded protein response (UPR) or endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Substrates that are unfolded, misfolded, or no longer required for cellular function can also be ubiquitin tagged for degradation by ATP dependent proteases, such as the proteasome in eukaryotes or ClpXP in prokaryotes.

Cullin-7 acts as scaffold protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The role of this complex is to tag damaged and excess proteins in the cell with ubiquitin. Intracellular and extracellular signals within the cell highly regulate when and which proteins are tagged with ubiquitin. Once attached to the protein, ubiquitin serves as a signaling molecule to the proteasomes, which then bind to the ubiquinated proteins and degrades them. This ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by breaking down unwanted proteins. Additionally, the system regulates the level of proteins involved in critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. Mutations in the CUL7 gene blocks the ability of the cullin-7 protein to bring together the components of this E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This leads to impaired ubiquination and hence the aggregation of damaged, misfolded, and excess proteins. Disruption of the protein degradation process plays a role in the pathogensis of prenatal growth retardation in humans, a key feature of 3-M syndrome.

Accumulation of misfolded proteins in proteinaceous inclusions is common to many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In cultured cells, when the production of misfolded proteins exceeds the capacity of the chaperone refolding system and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, misfolded proteins are actively transported to a cytoplasmic juxtanuclear structure called an aggresome. Whether aggresomes are benevolent or noxious is unknown, but they are of particular interest because of the appearance of similar inclusions in protein deposition diseases. Evidence shows that aggresomes serve a cytoprotective function and are associated with accelerated turnover of mutant proteins. Experiments show that mutant androgen receptor (AR), the protein responsible for X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy, forms insoluble aggregates and is toxic to cultured cells. Mutant AR was also found to form aggresomes in a process distinct from aggregation. Molecular and pharmacological interventions were used to disrupt aggresome formation, revealing their cytoprotective function. Aggresome-forming proteins were found to have an accelerated rate of turnover, and this turnover was slowed by inhibition of aggresome formation. Finally, it is shown that aggresome-forming proteins become membrane-bound and associate with lysosomal structures. Together, these findings suggest that aggresomes are cytoprotective, serving as cytoplasmic recruitment centers to facilitate degradation of toxic proteins.",

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's, are associated and correlated with protein aggregation and accumulation of misfolded proteins in inclusion bodies. For many years, protein aggregation was considered a random process by which misfolded proteins stick to each other to form inclusions (imagine a bundle of hairs haphazardly piling up in a corner of a room). Moreover, protein aggregates were thought to be toxic agents and the cause for neuronal dysfunction and death. However, recent studies, using advanced methods (i.e. fluorescence microscopy), show that protein aggregation may actually be a tightly regulated, organized process, by which the cell protects itself from toxic proteins by sequestration to inclusion bodies. In 2008, Daniel Kaganovich showed that eukaryotic cells sort misfolded proteins into two distinct inclusion bodies in a well-managed cellular process: JUNQ and IPOD are evolutionarily conserved, and are found in specific and defined cellular sites. Delivery of misfolded, aggregated proteins to JUNQ and IPOD require an intact cytoskeleton and specific cellular quality control components, such as Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs). The partition into the two distinct inclusion bodies is due to the different handling and processing of different kinds of misfolded proteins (e.g. ubiquitinated vs. non-ubiquitinated proteins). Segregation of toxic protein aggregates into JUNQ and IPOD inclusion bodies is a means by which mammalian cells can be rejuvenated through asymmetric division. Thus, the discovery of JUNQ and IPOD provided a new striking perspective of how cells manage misfolded aggregated proteins and gave convincing proof that protein aggregation is a non-random, well regulated and controlled cellular process. Furthermore, the discovery of JUNQ and IPOD suggested that in addition to temporal quality control (i.e. time dependent administration of damaged proteins) cells exploit homeostasis spatially: If degradation isn't available, protection of the cellular environment from a misfolded protein is accomplished by its sequestration to an aggregate inclusion.",

Several processes mediate this transition. For instance, in \"E. coli\", 70S ribosomes form 90S dimers upon binding with a small 6.5 kDa protein, ribosome modulation factor RMF. These intermediate ribosome dimers can subsequently bind a hibernation promotion factor (the 10.8 kDa protein, HPF) molecule to form a mature 100S ribosomal particle, in which the dimerization interface is made by the two 30S subunits of the two participating ribosomes. The ribosome dimers represent a hibernation state and are translationally inactive. A third protein that can bind to ribosomes when \"E. coli\" cells enter the stationary phase is YfiA (previously known as RaiA). HPF and YfiA are structurally similar, and both proteins can bind to the catalytic A- and P-sites of the ribosome. RMF blocks ribosome binding to mRNA by preventing interaction of the messenger with 16S rRNA. When bound to the ribosomes the C-terminal tail of \"E. coli \"YfiA interferes with the binding of RMF, thus preventing dimerization and resulting in the formation of translationally inactive monomeric 70S ribosomes. In addition to ribosome dimerization, the joining of the two ribosomal subunits can be blocked by RsfS (formerly called RsfA or YbeB). RsfS binds to L14, a protein of the large ribosomal subunit, and thereby blocks joining of the small subunit to form a functional 70S ribosome, slowing down or blocking translation entirely. RsfS proteins are found in almost all eubacteria (but not archaea) and homologs are present in mitochondria and chloroplasts (where they are called C7orf30 and \"iojap\", respectively).

The surveillance mechanism is in place to detect nonfunctional pre-ribosomes as well as nonfunctional mature ribosomes. In addition, the surveillance system brings the necessary degradation equipment and actually degrades the nonfunctional ribosomes. Pre-ribosomes that build up in the nucleus are destroyed by the exosome, which is a multisubunit complex with exonuclease activity. If perhaps defective ribosomal subunits do make it to the cytoplasm, there is an additional surveillance system in place to target their degradation in the cytoplasm. Certain mutations in residues of the large ribosome subunit will actually result in RNA decay and thus degradation of the unit.

Eukaryote-specific extensions of conserved proteins, ranging from a few residues or loops to very long alpha helices and additional domains, are highlighted in red. For a details, refer to the article on the eukaryotic ribosome. Historically, different nomenclatures have been used for ribosomal proteins. For instance, proteins have been numbered according to their migration properties in gel electrophoresis experiments. Therefore, different names may refer to homologous proteins from different organism, while identical names not necessarily denote homologous proteins. The table \"40S ribosomal proteins\" crossreferences the human ribosomal protein names with yeast, bacterial and archaeal homologs.

This can thus be used in the study of protein degradation in cells. Mutants resistant to emetine are altered in the 40S ribosomal subunit (S14 protein), and they exhibit cross-resistance to cryptopleurine, tylocrebrine, cephaeline and tubulosine, but not other inhibitors of protein synthesis. The compounds to which these mutants exhibit cross-resistance have been shown to share common structural determinants with emetine that are responsible for their biological activities.",

In eukaryotes, the small subunit protein rpS27A(S31) and the large subunit protein RPL40 are processed polypeptides, which are translated as fusion proteins carrying N-terminal ubiquitin domains. Both proteins are located next to important functional centers of the ribosome: The uncleaved ubiquitin domains of rpS27A(S31) and RPL40 would be positioned in the decoding site and near the translation factor binding site, respectively. These positions suggest that proteolytic cleavage is an essential step in the production of functional ribosomes. Indeed, mutations of the linker between the core of rpS27A(S31) and the ubiquitin domain are lethal in yeast.",

The ribosome selects aminoacylated transfer RNAs (tRNAs) based on the sequence of a protein-encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) and covalently links the amino acids into a polypeptide chain. Ribosomes from all organisms share a highly conserved catalytic center. However, the ribosomes of eukaryotes (animals, plants, fungi, and many unicellular organisms with a nucleus) are much larger than prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) ribosomes and subject to more complex regulation and biogenesis pathways. Eukaryotic ribosomes are also known as 80S ribosomes, referring to their sedimentation coefficients in Svedberg units, because they sediment faster than the prokaryotic (70S) ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes have two unequal subunits, designated small subunit (40S) and large subunit (60S) according to their sedimentation coefficients. Both subunits contain dozens of ribosomal proteins arranged on a scaffold composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The small subunit monitors the complementarity between tRNA anticodon and mRNA, while the large subunit catalyzes peptide bond formation.",
