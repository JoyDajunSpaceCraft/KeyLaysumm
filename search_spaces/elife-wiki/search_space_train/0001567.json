This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-\u03baB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-\u03b1, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-\u03baB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.",

In gram-negative sepsis, free LPS attaches to a circulating LPS-binding protein, and the complex then binds to the CD14 receptor on monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Engagement of CD14 (even at doses as minute as 10 pg/mL) results in intracellular signaling via an associated \"Toll-like receptor\" protein 4 (TLR-4). This signaling results in the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-\u03baB), which leads to transcription of a number of genes that trigger a proinflammatory response. It was the result of significant activation of mononuclear cells and synthesis of effector cytokines. It also results in profound activation of mononuclear cells and the production of potent effector cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. TLR-mediated activation helps to trigger the innate immune system to efficiently eradicate invading microbes, but the cytokines they produce also act on endothelial cells. There, they have a variety of effects, including reduced synthesis of anticoagulation factors such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor and thrombomodulin. The effects of the cytokines may be amplified by TLR-4 engagement on endothelial cells. In response to inflammation, a compensatory reaction of production of anti-inflammatory substances such as IL-4, IL-10 antagonists, IL-1 receptor, and cortisol occurs. This is called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). Both the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions are responsible for the course of sepsis and are described as MARS (Mixed Antagonist Response Syndrome). The aim of these processes is to keep inflammation at an appropriate level. CARS often leads to suppression of the immune system, which leaves patients vulnerable to secondary infection. It was once thought that SIRS or CARS could predominate in a septic individual, and it was proposed that CARS follows SIRS in a two-wave process. It is now believed that the systemic inflammatory response and the compensatory anti-inflammatory response occur simultaneously.",

Because NF-\u03baB controls many genes involved in inflammation, it is not surprising that NF-\u03baB is found to be chronically active in many inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, sepsis, gastritis, asthma, atherosclerosis and others. It is important to note though, that elevation of some NF-\u03baB activators, such as osteoprotegerin (OPG), are associated with elevated mortality, especially from cardiovascular diseases. Elevated NF-\u03baB has also been associated with schizophrenia. Recently, NF-\u03baB activation has been suggested as a possible molecular mechanism for the catabolic effects of cigarette smoke in skeletal muscle and sarcopenia. Research has shown that during inflammation the function of a cell depends on signals it activates in response to contact with adjacent cells and to combinations of hormones, especially cytokines that act on it through specific receptors. A cells\u2019 phenotype within a tissue develops through mutual stimulation of feedback signals that coordinate its function with other cells; this is especially evident during reprogramming of cell function when a tissue is exposed to inflammation, because cells alter their phenotype, and gradually express combinations of genes that prepare the tissue for regeneration after the cause of inflammation is removed. Particularly important are feedback responses that develop between tissue resident cells, and circulating cells of the immune system. Fidelity of feedback responses between diverse cell types and the immune system depends on the integrity of mechanisms that limit the range of genes activated by NF-\u03baB, allowing only expression of genes which contribute to an effective immune response and subsequently, a complete restoration of tissue function after resolution of inflammation. In cancer, mechanisms that regulate gene expression in response to inflammatory stimuli are altered to the point that a cell ceases to link its survival with the mechanisms that coordinate its phenotype and its function with the rest of the tissue. This is often evident in severely compromised regulation of NF-\u03baB activity, which allows cancer cells to express abnormal cohorts of NF-\u03baB target genes. This results in not only the cancer cells functioning abnormally: cells of surrounding tissue alter their function and cease to support the organism exclusively. Additionally, several types of cells in the microenvironment of cancer may change their phenotypes to support cancer growth. Inflammation, therefore, is a process that tests the fidelity of tissue components because the process that leads to tissue regeneration requires coordination of gene expression between diverse cell types.",

            "document": "Biochemical cascade . The main goal of biochemical cascades in lymphocytes is the secretion of molecules that can suppress altered cells or eliminate pathogenic agents, through proliferation, differentiation and activation of these cells. Therefore, the antigenic receptors play a central role in signal transduction in lymphocytes, because when antigens interact with them lead to a cascade of signal events. These receptors, that recognize the antigen soluble (B cells) or linked to a molecule on Antigen Presenting Cells (T cells), don't have long cytoplasm tails, so they are anchored to signal proteins, which contain a long cytoplasmic tails with a motif that can be phosphorylated (ITAM \u2013 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and resulting in different signal pathways. The antigen receptor and signal protein form a stable complex, named BCR or TCR, in B or T cells, respectively. The family Src is essential for signal transduction in these cells, because it's responsible for phosphorylation of ITAMs. Therefore, Lyn and Lck, in lymphocytes B and T, respectively, phosphorylate ITAMs after the antigen recognition and the conformational change of the receptor, which leads to the binding of Syk/Zap-70 kinases to ITAM and its activation. Syk kinase is specific of lymphocytes B and Zap-70 is present in T cells. After activation of these enzymes, some adaptor proteins are phosphorylated, like BLNK (B cells) and LAT (T cells). These proteins after phosphorylation become activated and allow binding of others enzymes that continue the biochemical cascade. One example of a protein that binds to adaptor proteins and become activated is PLC that is very important in the lymphocyte signal pathways. PLC is responsible for PKC activation, via DAG and Ca, which leads to phosphorylation of CARMA1 molecule, and formation of CBM complex. This complex activates I\u03ba\u03ba kinase, which phosphorylates I-\u03baB, and then allows the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and transcription of genes encoding cytokines, for example. Others transcriptional factors like NFAT and AP1 complex are also important for transcription of cytokines. The differentiation of B cells to plasma cells is also an example of a signal mechanism in lymphocytes, induced by a cytokine receptor. In this case, some interleukins bind to a specific receptor, which leads to activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. Consequently, the BLIMP1 protein is translated and inhibits PAX5, allowing immunoglobulin genes transcription and activation of XBP1 (important for the secretory apparatus formation and enhancing of protein synthesis). Also, the coreceptors (CD28/CD19) play an important role because they can improve the antigen/receptor binding and initiate parallel cascade events, like activation o PI3 Kinase. PIP3 then is responsible for activation of several proteins, like vav (leads to activation of JNK pathway, which consequently leads to activation of c-Jun) and btk (can also activate PLC).",

The airway epithelium together with alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells play a major role in the initial recognition of bacterial products getting into the lower airways with the air. Since some of these products are potent proinflammatory stimuli it is extremely important for the immune system to distinguish between pathogens and non-pathogenic commensals. This prevents the development of constant inflammation and forms tolerance against harmless microbiota.  This process becomes much more intriguing when taking into account that commensals often share their surface molecules with pathogens. Epithelial cells are equipped with very sensitive recognition tools - toll like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) which recognize a broad variety of microbial structural components. After recognition of pathogenic bacteria proinflammatory pathways are activated and cellular components of the adaptive and innate immunity are recruited to the infection site. One key regulator in this process is the NF-\u03baB which translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and activates pro-inflammatory genes in epithelial cells and macrophages.

Regulatory proteins that bind to DNA, RNA, and/or proteins are key effectors in these processes and function by positively or negatively regulating specific protein level and function in a cell. And, while DNA binding transcription factors provide a mechanism for specific control of cellular responses, a model where DNA binding transcription factors are the sole regulators of gene activity is also unlikely.

In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB), which are proteins that contain multiple copies of a sequence called ankyrin repeats. By virtue of their ankyrin repeat domains, the I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of NF-\u03baB proteins and keep them sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. I\u03baBs are a family of related proteins that have an N-terminal regulatory domain, followed by six or more ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain near their C terminus. Although the I\u03baB family consists of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and Bcl-3, the best-studied and major I\u03baB protein is I\u03baB\u03b1. Due to the presence of ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal halves, p105 and p100 also function as I\u03baB proteins. The c-terminal half of p100, that is often referred to as I\u03baB\u03b4, also functions as an inhibitor. I\u03baB\u03b4 degradation in response to developmental stimuli, such as those transduced through LT\u03b2R, potentiate NF-\u03baB dimer activation in a NIK dependent non-canonical pathway. Activation of the NF-\u03baB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of I\u03baB proteins. This occurs primarily via activation of a kinase called the I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits and a \"master\" regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) or IKK gamma. When activated by signals, usually coming from the outside of the cell, the I\u03baB kinase phosphorylates two serine residues located in an I\u03baB regulatory domain. When phosphorylated on these serines (e.g., serines 32 and 36 in human I\u03baB\u03b1), the I\u03baB proteins are modified by a process called ubiquitination, which then leads them to be degraded by a cell structure called the proteasome.  With the degradation of I\u03baB, the NF-\u03baB complex is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can 'turn on' the expression of specific genes that have DNA-binding sites for NF-\u03baB nearby. The activation of these genes by NF-\u03baB then leads to the given physiological response, for example, an inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, or cellular proliferation. Translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus can be detected immunocytochemically and measured by laser scanning cytometry. NF-\u03baB turns on expression of its own repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. The newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 then re-inhibits NF-\u03baB and, thus, forms an auto feedback loop, which results in oscillating levels of NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, several viruses, including the AIDS virus HIV, have binding sites for NF-\u03baB that controls the expression of viral genes, which in turn contribute to viral replication or viral pathogenicity. In the case of HIV-1, activation of NF-\u03baB may, at least in part, be involved in activation of the virus from a latent, inactive state. YopP is a factor secreted by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, that prevents the ubiquitination of I\u03baB. This causes this pathogen to effectively inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and thus block the immune response of a human infected with Yersinia.",

Discrete clusters of molecules are secreted, which act as mediators, inducing the activity of subsequent cascades of biochemical changes. Each cytokine binds to specific receptors on various cell types, and each cell type responds differently by altering the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways, depending on the receptors that the cell expresses and the signaling molecules present inside the cell. Collectively, this reprogramming process induces a stepwise change in cell phenotypes, which will ultimately lead to restoration of tissue function and toward regaining essential structural integrity. A tissue can thereby heal, depending on the productive communication between the cells present at the site of damage, and the immune system. Key factor in healing is the regulation of cytokine gene expression, which enables complementary groups of cells to respond to inflammatory mediators in a manner that gradually produces essential changes in tissue physiology. Cancer cells have either permanent (genetic) or reversible (epigenetic) changes on their genome, which partly inhibit their communication with surrounding cells and with the immune system. Cancer cells do not communicate with their tissue microenvironment in a manner that protects tissue integrity; instead, the movement and the survival of cancer cells become possible in locations where they can impair tissue function.

Research has been conducted on Nurr1\u2019s role in inflammation, and may provide important information in treating disorders caused by dopaminergic neuron disease. Inflammation in the CNS can result from activated microglia (macrophage analogs for the central nervous system) and other pro-inflammatory factors, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS binds to toll-like receptors (TLR), which induces inflammatory gene expression by promoting signal-dependent transcription factors. To determine which cells are dopaminergic, experiments measured the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is needed for dopamine synthesis. It has been shown that Nurr1 protects dopaminergic neurons from LPS-induced inflammation, by reducing inflammatory gene expression in microglia and astrocytes. When a short hairpin for Nurr1 was expressed in microglia and astrocytes, these cells produced inflammatory mediators, such as TNFa, NO synthase and IL-1\u03b2, supporting the conclusion that reduced Nurr1 promotes inflammation and leads to cell death of dopaminergic neurons. Nurr1 interacts with the transcription factor complex NF-\u03baB-p65 on the inflammatory gene promoters. However, Nurr1 is dependent on other factors to be able to participate in these interactions. Nurr1 needs to be sumoylated and its co-regulating factor, glycogen synthase kinase 3, needs to be phosphorylated for these interactions to occur.

The epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and the Polycomb group of proteins such as Bmi-1, the H3K27me3 transferase Ezh2, its demethylase JMJD3, and the H3K4me3 transferase MLL were shown to be regulators in the expression of tumour suppressor p16INK4a in \u03b2-cell proliferation and regeneration.

The inflammatory response arises from vascular tissues and specialized white blood cells, and a persistent state of inflammation under diabetic stress leads to clots and vascular deterioration. Patients suffer edema, aneurysms, and injuries that cannot heal properly because the vascular system is unable to respond properly when under epigenetic influences. Diabetes and the associated hyperglycemia can lead to production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and growth factors. Together, they activate multiple signal transduction pathways including oxidant stress, tyrosine kinases, PKC, and MAPKs leading to activation of transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, and dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms including HKme, histone lysine acetylation, and DNA methylation via the action of corresponding methyltransferases, demethylases, acetylases, and deacetylases.

Mammals possess this system, which begins in the kidneys where the developmental signal is manufactured. The developmental signal, also called a cytokine, is erythropoietin in this case. (Cytokines are key regulators of hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation.) Erythropoietin's activity is initiated when hematopoietic cytokine receptors become activated. In erythrocyte regulation, erythropoietin is a protein containing 165 amino acids that plays a role in activating the cytoplasmic protein kinase JAK. The results of some newer research have also indicated that the aforementioned cytokine receptors function with members of the JAK tyrosine kinase family. The cytokine receptors activate the JAK kinases. This then results in the phosphorylation of several signaling proteins located in the cell membrane. This subsequently affects both the stimulation of ligand-mediated receptors and intracellular signaling pathway activation. Substrates for JAK kinases mediate some gene responses and more. The process is also responsible for mediating the production of blood cells. In this case, erythropoietin binds to the corresponding plasma membrane receptor, dimerizing the receptor. The dimer is responsible for activating the kinase JAK via binding. Tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor are consequently phosphorylated by the activated protein kinase JAK. Overall, this is also how a receptor tyrosine kinase might be activated by a ligand to regulate erythrocyte formation.",

These cells exhibit a potent phagocytic activity that ensures the proper function of the retina. Therefore, oxidative stress can potentially damage the RPE cells and cause vision impairment. Studies in human RPE cells have suggested that the presence of oxidative stress triggering molecules, such as HO causes the fragmentation of the DNA that in turn triggers apoptosis. These studies have proposed that PD1 acts as a signaling molecule and through its ligand-receptor interaction down-regulates the expression of genes, such as the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. The inhibition of NF-\u03baB results in the down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory gene COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) which is responsible for the release of prostaglandins, a potent pro-inflammatory mediator. In addition, PD1 has an important role in regulating the expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bax and Bad) that precedes the release of the cytochrome c complex from the mitochondria and the formation of the apoptosome. The presence of PD1 up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, while it inhibits the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad. Specifically, PD1 regulates this protein family by promoting the dephosphorylation of Bcl-x by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at residue Ser-62 which in turn heterodimerizes with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and inactivates it. Consequently, the activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins results in the inhibition of the caspase 3 enzyme, thus preventing apoptosis and promoting RPE cell survival.",

Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell. Cells and tissues can vary in competence, their ability to respond to external signals.",

EP is classified as a relaxant type of prostaglandin receptor based on its ability, upon activation, to relax the contraction of certain smooth muscle preparations and smooth muscle-containing tissues that have been pre-contracted by stimulation. When bound to PGE or other of its agonists, it mobilizes G proteins containing the Gs alpha subunit (i.e. G\u03b1)-G beta-gammaes (i.e. G) complex. The complex then dissociate into its G\u03b1 and G components which act to regulate cell signaling pathways. In particular, G\u03b1 stimulates adenyl cyclase to raise cellular levels of cAMP; cAMP activates PKA, a kinase which in turn activates signaling molecules, in particular, the transcription factor, CREB. Activated CREB stimulates the expression of genes such as c-fos, somatostatin, and corticotropin-releasing hormone that regulate cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, cellular survival, and angiogenesis. EP activation of G proteins also activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR, ERK, and p38 MARK pathways. Activation of ERK induces expression of EGR1, a transcription factor which controls transcription of genes involved in cellular differentiation and mitogenesis. EP also interacts with Prostaglandin E receptor 4-associated protein (EPRAP) to inhibit phosphorylation of the proteasome protein, p105, thereby suppressing a cells ability to activate nuclear factor kappa B, a transcription factor that controls genes coding for cytokines and other elements that regulate inflammation, cell growth, and cell survival (see NF-\u03baB#Structure). The activation of these pathways lead to variety of different types of functional responses depending on cell type, the pathways available in different cell types, and numerous other factors; EP activation may therefore have diverse effects on cell function depending on these factors. In many respects, EP actions resemble those of another type of another relaxant prostanoid receptor, EP but differs from the contractile prostanoid receptors, EP and EP receptors which mobilize G proteins containing the G\u03b1-G\u03b2\u03b3 complex. Following its activation, EP undergoes homologous desensitization. That is, EP becomes insensitive to further activation and internalizes. This effect limits the duration and extent to which EP can stimulate cells. Agents which activate certain isoforms of protein kinase C can also desensitize EP by a process termed heterologous desensitization.",

Several of these receptors are kinases that start to phosphorylate themselves and other proteins when binding to a ligand. This phosphorylation can generate a binding site for a different protein and thus induce protein\u2013protein interaction. In Figure 3, the ligand (called epidermal growth factor (EGF)) binds to the receptor (called EGFR). This activates the receptor to phosphorylate itself. The phosphorylated receptor binds to an adaptor protein (GRB2), which couples the signal to further downstream signaling processes. For example, one of the signal transduction pathways that are activated is called the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The signal transduction component labeled as \"MAPK\" in the pathway was originally called \"ERK,\" so the pathway is called the MAPK/ERK pathway.

Studies have found these two factors to be within the same region of developing dopaminergic neurons, both of these factors were present in order to have expression for the dopamine phenotype.  Research has been conducted on Nurr1\u2019s role in inflammation, and may provide important information in treating disorders caused by dopaminergic neuron disease. Inflammation in the CNS can result from activated microglia (macrophage analogs for the central nervous system) and other pro-inflammatory factors, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS binds to toll-like receptors (TLR), which induces inflammatory gene expression by promoting signal-dependent transcription factors. To determine which cells are dopaminergic, experiments measured the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is needed for dopamine synthesis. It has been shown that Nurr1 protects dopaminergic neurons from LPS-induced inflammation, by reducing inflammatory gene expression in microglia and astrocytes. When a short hairpin for Nurr1 was expressed in microglia and astrocytes, these cells produced inflammatory mediators, such as TNFa, NO synthase and IL-1\u03b2, supporting the conclusion that reduced Nurr1 promotes inflammation and leads to cell death of dopaminergic neurons. Nurr1 interacts with the transcription factor complex NF-\u03baB-p65 on the inflammatory gene promoters. However, Nurr1 is dependent on other factors to be able to participate in these interactions. Nurr1 needs to be sumoylated and its co-regulating factor, glycogen synthase kinase 3, needs to be phosphorylated for these interactions to occur.

It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a methylase domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in methylation state of DNA in that region will subsequently result. Transcription rates of genes so-affected will be reduced. Many of the effector domains function to modulate either the DNA directly - e.g. via methylation, cleaving, or recombination of the target DNA sequence - or by modulating its transcription rate - e.g. inhibiting transcription via repressor domains that block transcriptional machinery, promoting transcription with activation domains that recruit transcriptional machinery to the site, or histone- or other epigenetic-modification domains that affect chromatin state and the ability of transcriptional machinery to access the affected genes. Epigenetic modification is a major theme in determining varying expression levels for genes, as explained by the idea that how tightly-wound the DNA strand is - from histones at the local level up to chromatin at the chromosomal level - can influence the accessibility of sequences of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing the rate at which it can be transcribed. If, instead of impacting the DNA strand directly, as described above, a designer zinc-finger protein instead affects epigenetic modification state for a target DNA region, modulation of gene expression could similarly be accomplished. In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression in vivo, Choo \"et al\" designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. This specific oncogene is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The oncogene typically enables leukemia cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of cancer. By including a nuclear localization signal with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo \"et al\" were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo.

Epigenetic modifications are heritable alterations that are not due to changes in the sequence of nucleotides. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, alter the accessibility to DNA and change chromatin structure, thereby regulating patterns of gene expression. Methylated histones can act as binding sites for certain transcription factors due to their bromodomains and chromodomains. Methylated histones can also prevent the binding of transcription factors by hiding the transcription factor's recognition site, which is usually found on the major groove of DNA. The methyl groups bound to the cytosine residues lie in the major groove of DNA, the same region most transcription factors use to read a DNA sequence. A common epigenetic tag found in DNA is the covalent attachment of a methyl group to the C5 position of the cytosine found in CpG dinucleotide sequences. CpG methylation is an important mechanism of transcriptional silencing. Methylation of CpG islands is shown to reduce gene expression by the formation of tightly condensed heterochromatin that is transcriptionally inactive. CpG sites in a gene are most commonly found in the promoter regions of a gene while also being present in non promoter regions. The CpG sites in non promoter regions tend to be constitutively methylated, causing transcription machinery to ignore them as possible promoters. The CpG site near promoter regions are mostly left unmethylated until a cell decides to methylate them and repress transcription. Methylation of CpGs in promoter regions result in the transcriptional silencing of a gene.
