Emerging data suggests that THC acts via CB receptors in the hypothalamic nuclei to directly increase appetite. It is thought that hypothalamic neurons tonically produce endocannabinoids that work to tightly regulate hunger. The amount of endocannabinoids produced is inversely correlated with the amount of leptin in the blood. For example, mice without leptin not only become massively obese but express abnormally high levels of hypothalamic endocannabinoids as a compensatory mechanism. Similarly, when these mice were treated with an endocannabinoid inverse agonists, such as rimonabant, food intake was reduced. When the CB receptor is knocked out in mice, these animals tend to be leaner and less hungry than wild-type mice. A related study examined the effect of THC on the hedonic (pleasure) value of food and found enhanced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and increased pleasure-related behavior after administration of a sucrose solution. A related study found that endocannabinoids affect taste perception in taste cells In taste cells, endocannabinoids were shown to selectively enhance the strength of neural signaling for sweet tastes, whereas leptin decreased the strength of this same response. While there is need for more research, these results suggest that cannabinoid activity in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens is related to appetitive, food-seeking behavior.",

In an experiment, scientists measured how much food and water mice consumed when they were born without dopamine in their systems.

The scientists then injected the mice without dopamine with its precursor, L-DOPA, and the mice started eating again. But, even though the mice were born without dopamine in their systems, they still had the capacity to control their feeding and drinking behaviors, suggesting that dopamine does not play a role in developing those neural circuits. Instead, dopamine is more closely related to the drive for hunger and thirst. Although the lack of dopamine resulted in adipsia in these rats, low levels of dopamine do not necessarily cause adipsia.",

Activity anorexia (AA) is a condition where rats begin to exercise excessively while simultaneously cutting down on their food intake, similar to human anorexia nervosa or hypergymnasia. When given free access to food and an exercise wheel, rats normally develop a balanced routine between exercise and food intake, which turns them into fit rats. However, if food intake is restricted and wheel access is unrestricted, rats begin to exercise more and eat less, resulting in excessive weight loss and, ultimately, death. The running cycles shift so that most of the running is done in hours before feeding is scheduled. In other conditions, AA does not develop. Unrestricted food access and restricted wheel access will not cause any significant change in either feeding or exercise routine. Also, if rats are restricted both in food intake and wheel access, they will adjust accordingly. In fact, if rats are first trained to the feeding schedule and then given unrestricted access to a running wheel, they will not develop AA behavior. Results support the notion that the running interferes with adaptation to the new feeding schedule and is associated with the reward system in the brain. One theory is that running simulates foraging, a natural behavior in wild rats. Laboratory rats therefore run (forage) more in response to food shortages. The effect of semi-starvation on activity has also been studied in primates. Rhesus macaque males become hyperactive in response to long-term chronic food restriction.",

Recent research has shown that PRDM16 is present in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. The activity of PRDM16 in white adipose tissue leads to the production of brown fat-like adipocytes within white adipose tissue, called beige cells (also called brite cells). These beige cells have a brown adipose tissue-like phenotype and actions, including thermogenic processes seen in BAT.  In mice, the levels of PRDM16 within WAT, specifically anterior subcutaneous WAT and inguinal subcutaneous WAT, is about 50% that of interscapular BAT, both in protein expression and in mRNA quantity. This expression takes place primarily within mature adipocytes.  Transgenic aP2-PRDM16 mice were used in a study to observe the effects of PRDM16 expression in WAT. The study found that the presence of PRDM16 in subcutaneous WAT leads to a significant up-regulation of brown-fat selective genes UCP-1, CIDEA, and PPARGC1A. This up-regulation lead to the development of a BAT-like phenotype within the white adipose tissue.  Expression of PRDM16 has also been shown to protect against high-fat diet induced weight gain. Seale et al.\u2019s experiment with aP2-PRDM16 transgenic mice and wild type mice showed that transgenic mice eating a 60% high-fat diet had significantly less weight gain than wild type mice on the same diet. Seale et al. determined the weight difference was not due to differences in food intake, as both transgenic and wild type mice were consuming the same amount of food on a daily basis. Rather, the weight difference stemmed from higher energy expenditure in the transgenic mice. Another of Seale et al.\u2019s experiments showed the transgenic mice consumed a greater volume of oxygen over a 72-hour period than the wild type mice, showing a greater amount of energy expenditure in the transgenic mice. This energy expenditure in turn is attributed to PRDM16\u2019s ability to up-regulate UCP-1 and CIDEA gene expression, resulting in thermogenesis.",

Additionally, mice without previous experience are able to successfully learn more efficient foraging behavior within 14 days of conditioning, a strong indication that foraging behavior is not strictly genetically determined and that trial-and-error may be a contributing mechanism. The behavior is also affected socially, as mice raised in specific environments forage in ways that mice in other environments may not. For example, large Japanese field mice raised in environments with more tannin-rich nuts show greater selectivity than those that do not.

Programmed cell death can be reduced or eliminated in the developing nervous system by the targeted deletion of pro-apoptotic genes or by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes. The absence or reduction of PCD can cause serious anatomical malformations but can also result in minimal consequences depending on the gene targeted, neuronal population, and stage of development. Excess progenitor cell proliferation that leads to gross brain abnormalities is often lethal, as seen in caspase-3 or caspase-9 knockout mice which develop exencephaly in the forebrain. The brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia of these mice develop normally, however, suggesting that the involvement of caspases in PCD during development depends on the brain region and cell type. Knockout or inhibition of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), also results in malformations and increased embryonic lethality. Manipulation of apoptosis regulator proteins Bcl-2 and Bax (overexpression of Bcl-2 or deletion of Bax) produces an increase in the number of neurons in certain regions of the nervous system such as the retina, trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, PCD of neurons due to Bax deletion or Bcl-2 overexpression does not result in prominent morphological or behavioral abnormalities in mice. For example, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 have generally normal motor skills and vision and only show impairment in complex behaviors such as learning and anxiety.

There was the greatest foraging (bringing back the most food) during the pre-emergence phase of the colony cycle because of increased nest construction and a large nutritional demand from the brood. Foraging is important because the nest needs water to maintain a certain temperature.

Weidong Li and Steven Kushner led a team in the Silva lab that developed a treatment for the cognitive deficits associated with an animal model of Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). They discovered that Lovastatin, a statin that crosses the blood-brain barrier, at a dose that does not affect control mice, rescues the Ras/MAPK signaling, synaptic plasticity and behavioral deficits of mice with a NF1 mutation. Statins decrease the levels of isoprenyls, lipid groups that are required for the isoprenylation and activity of Ras, a signaling molecule normally regulated by the protein encoded by the NF1 gene. The work in the Silva lab showed that the NF1 mutation leads to increases in the levels of active Ras in the brain, and that statins reverse this increase without affecting Ras signaling in controls. These results have led to a number of small promising, but inconclusive, clinical trials, and to two large on going clinical studies in the USA and Europe. A team led by Dan Ehninger in the Silva lab also showed that rapamycin, an FDA approved inhibitor of mTOR, can reverse the late-LTP deficits and learning impairments they discovered in an animal model of Tuberous Sclerosis (Tsc2 heterozygous mice). Interestingly, TSC is highly associated with autism, but the Tsc2 heterozygous mice did not show any autism-like behavioral abnormalities, such as social interaction deficits. Artificially activating the immune system of pregnant mice, however, does reveal social interaction deficits in Tsc2 heterozygous progeny, suggesting that the autism-like symptoms in TSC require not only Tsc mutations, but also another factor, such as immune activation during pregnancy. Importantly, analyses of human TSC data suggested a similar interaction between the TSC mutation and immuno-activation during pregnancy. Recently, Miou Zhou and colleagues at the Silva lab found that rapamycin is also capable of both preventing and reversing behavioral deficits caused by mutation of a schizophrenia-causing gene (DISC 1) in neurons that are born and develop in adult mice (i.e., adult neurogenesis). Surprisingly, rapamycin reverses behavioral deficits despite its inability to reverse structural deficits discovered in neurons with Disc 1 knock down. All together, these findings make a compelling case that adult treatments may be effective at reversing behavioral cognitive and psychiatric symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as NF1, TSC and Schizophrenia.",

            "document": "Social learning in animals . An animal generally learns its natural predators through direct experience. Thus, predator learning is very costly and increases the predation risk for each individual. In group learning scenarios, a few members can experience the danger of predation and transmit this acquired predator recognition throughout the group. Consequently, in future encounters, the entire group can recognize the threat of predation and respond accordingly. This social learning method has been shown in group mobbing behavior in the common blackbird (\"Turdus merula\"). Blackbird groups were more likely to mob an object if a member of the group had previously been conditioned to recognize it as a predator. This behavior has also been recorded in guppies, where naive guppies from environments with less natural predators significantly improved their anti-predator behavior when placed in a group with guppies from a high predation environment. Social learning also provides individuals with information about food sources in an environment. This can include information on where to find food, what to eat, and how to eat it. There are several examples in the animal kingdom in which animals utilize social learning to find food. For example, birds are more likely to forage in areas where they already see birds feeding. The Norway rat (\"Rattus norvegicus\") also utilizes social learning behaviors to find food sources. Mature rats leave sensory trails to and from food sources that are preferentially followed by naive pups. Animals can also learn what to eat from social learning with conspecifics. Experimentally discerning harmful foods from edible foods can be dangerous for a naive individual; however, inexperienced individuals can avoid this cost through observing older individuals that already have acquired this knowledge. For example, several species of bird will avoid food if they see another individual eat it and become ill. Observation can also educate the observer about how to eat particular foods. Red squirrels (\"Sciurus vulgaris\") have been shown to more successfully open hickory nuts after watching more experienced squirrels open the nuts.",

Leading researcher Paul Greengard and his colleagues hypothesized that increasing p11 levels would result in the mice exhibiting antidepressant-like behaviors, and the opposite if p11 protein levels were reduced. They used a test that is used to measure antidepressant-like activity to affirm this hypothesis. In their findings, over-expressed p11 genes, compared to the control mice, had increased mobility and more 5-HT receptors at the cell surface, which made possible more serotonin transmission. When researchers \"knocked out\" the p11 gene in mice, they found that the knockout mice had fewer receptors at the cell surface, reduced serotonin signaling, reduced responsiveness to sweet reward, and decreased mobility, behaviors all characteristic of depression-like behaviors. Also, the 5-HT receptors of p11 knockout mice were less responsive to serotonin and antidepressant drugs compared to those of control mice, which further implicates p11 in the main action of antidepressant medications. Antidepressant manipulations increase the p11 levels, whereas depressant manipulations reduce it. Therefore, in order to achieve an anti-depression effect, antidepressant medications should focus on the main action of the p11 proteins and increase levels of the protein.",

They maintain the cells and metabolise the photosynthetic products; this process is termed kleptoplasty, and the sacoglossans are the only animals to employ it; some ciliates and foramanifera (protists) also employ the strategy. Sacoglossans have been known to survive for months living solely on the photosynthetic products of their acquired plastids. This process is somewhat mystifying, as the upkeep of chloroplasts usually requires interaction with genes encoded in the plant cell nucleus. This almost seems to suggest that the genes have been laterally transferred from algae to the animals. DNA amplification experiments on \"Elysia chlorotica\" adults and eggs using \"Vaucheria litorea\" derived primers revealed the presence of psbO, an algal nuclear gene. These results were likely an artefact, as most recent results based on transcriptomic analysis and sequencing of genomic DNA from the slug's eggs reject the hypothesis that lateral gene transfer supports kleptoplast longevity. Sacoglossans are able to choose which method of feeding they utilize. The switch from active feeding to photosynthesis in sacoglossans is triggered by the shortage of food resource, and typically not preferred. If food is readily available, the animal will actively consume. Starvation periods (periods of photosynthesis and no active feeding) vary between species of sacoglossans from less than a week to over four months, and photosynthesis is used as a last resort mechanism to avoid mortality. Another unclear step in the process is how the chloroplasts are protected from digestion, and how they adapt to their new position in animal cells without the membranes that would control their environment in the algae. However it is achieved, kleptoplasty is an important strategy for many genera of Placobranchacaea. One species of \"Elysia\" feeds on a seasonally-calcifying alga. Because it is unable to penetrate the calcified cell walls, the animal can only feed for part of the year, relying on the ingested chloroplasts to survive whilst the foodstuff is calcified, until later in the season when the calcification is lost and the grazing can continue.",

When Dr. Mantzoros and his team examined the GLP-1 analog liraglutide in diabetic adults and found that liraglutide was decreasing activation in the brain's cortex, the area that increases control and makes individuals more attentive to what they are eating. This suggests that individuals on liraglutide find highly desirable foods less appealing and that the medication might prove an effective weight loss therapy for people who tend to eat foods as a reward, such as when they are stressed.

Decreases in emotion and salience-related limbic activity, including the insula and amygdala, were attenuated at 4 weeks.

They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic arthropods, but may take any invertebrate or vertebrate prey they can catch, including such animals like leeches and mice. Green herons are intolerant of other birds \u2013 including conspecifics \u2013 when feeding and are not seen to forage in groups. They typically stand still on shore or in shallow water or perch upon branches and await prey. Sometimes they drop food, insects, or other small objects on the water's surface to attract fish, making them one of the few known tool-using species. This feeding method has led some to title the green and closely related striated heron as among the world's most intelligent birds. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey.",

Emerging data suggests that THC acts via CB receptors in the hypothalamic nuclei to directly increase appetite. It is thought that hypothalamic neurons tonically produce endocannabinoids that work to tightly regulate hunger. The amount of endocannabinoids produced is inversely correlated with the amount of leptin in the blood. For example, mice without leptin not only become massively obese but express abnormally high levels of hypothalamic endocannabinoids as a compensatory mechanism. Similarly, when these mice were treated with an endocannabinoid inverse agonists, such as rimonabant, food intake was reduced. When the CB receptor is knocked out in mice, these animals tend to be leaner and less hungry than wild-type mice. A related study examined the effect of THC on the hedonic (pleasure) value of food and found enhanced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and increased pleasure-related behavior after administration of a sucrose solution. A related study found that endocannabinoids affect taste perception in taste cells In taste cells, endocannabinoids were shown to selectively enhance the strength of neural signaling for sweet tastes, whereas leptin decreased the strength of this same response. While there is need for more research, these results suggest that cannabinoid activity in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens is related to appetitive, food-seeking behavior.",

Activity anorexia (AA) is a condition where rats begin to exercise excessively while simultaneously cutting down on their food intake, similar to human anorexia nervosa or hypergymnasia. When given free access to food and an exercise wheel, rats normally develop a balanced routine between exercise and food intake, which turns them into fit rats. However, if food intake is restricted and wheel access is unrestricted, rats begin to exercise more and eat less, resulting in excessive weight loss and, ultimately, death. The running cycles shift so that most of the running is done in hours before feeding is scheduled. In other conditions, AA does not develop. Unrestricted food access and restricted wheel access will not cause any significant change in either feeding or exercise routine. Also, if rats are restricted both in food intake and wheel access, they will adjust accordingly. In fact, if rats are first trained to the feeding schedule and then given unrestricted access to a running wheel, they will not develop AA behavior. Results support the notion that the running interferes with adaptation to the new feeding schedule and is associated with the reward system in the brain. One theory is that running simulates foraging, a natural behavior in wild rats. Laboratory rats therefore run (forage) more in response to food shortages.

Prenatal and perinatal exposure to nonylphenol has been linked with developmental abnormalities in adipose tissue and therefore in metabolic hormone synthesis and release (Merrill 2011). Specifically, by acting as an estrogen mimic, nonylphenol has generally been shown to interfere with hypothalamic appetite control. The hypothalamus responds to the hormone leptin, which signals the feeling of fullness after eating, and nonylphenol has been shown to both increase and decrease eating behavior by interfering with leptin signaling in the midbrain. Nonylphenol has been shown mimic the action of leptin on neuropeptide Y and anorectic POMC neurons, which has an anti-obesity effect by decreasing eating behavior. This was seen when estrogen or estrogen mimics were injected into the ventromedial hypothalamus. On the other hand, nonylphenol has been shown to increase food intake and have obesity enhancing properties by lowering the expression of these anorexigenic neurons in the brain. Additionally, nonylphenol affects the expression of ghrelin: an enzyme produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite. Ghrelin expression is positively regulated by estrogen signaling in the stomach, and it is also important in guiding the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes (fat cells). Thus, acting as an estrogen mimic, prenatal and perinatal exposure to nonylphenol has been shown to increase appetite and encourage the body to store fat later in life. Finally, long-term exposure to nonylphenol has been shown to affect insulin signaling in the liver of adult male rats.",

Research on Single Cell Protein Technology started a century ago when Max Delbr\u00fcck and his colleagues found out the high value of surplus brewer\u2019s yeast as a feeding supplement for animals. During World War I and World War II, yeast-SCP was employed on a large scale in Germany to counteract food shortages during the war. Inventions for SCP production often represented milestones for biotechnology in general: for example, in 1919, Sak in Denmark and Hayduck in Germany invented a method named, \u201cZulaufverfahren\u201d, (fed-batch) in which sugar solution was fed continuously to an aerated suspension of yeast instead of adding yeast to diluted sugar solution once (batch). In post war period, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) emphasized on hunger and malnutrition problems of the world in 1960 and introduced the concept of protein gap, showing that 25% of the world population had a deficiency of protein intake in their diet. It was also feared that agricultural production would fail to meet the increasing demands of food by humanity. By the mid 60\u2019s, almost quarter of a million tons of food yeast were being produced in different parts of the world and Soviet Union alone produced some 900,000 tons by 1970 of food and fodder yeast.",

Yet selective reuptake inhibitors of norepinephrine and dopamine (nisoxetine and a substance codenamed GBR12783, respectively) independently have no effect on food intake in mice. However, when given in combination, there is profound inhibition of food intake. This demonstrates a synergistic interaction between dopamine and norepinephrine in controlling ingestive behavior, similar to the action of SNRIs. The fact that nisoxetine alone does not affect food intake suggests that norepinephrine alone is insufficient to affect feeding or that the blocked reuptake of norepinephrine by nisoxetine is acting in the wrong place. Unlike nisoxetine, its sulfur analog thionisoxetine reduces food consumption in rodents and is a more promising treatment for obesity and eating disorders.",

A study, published in 2016 in Nature, has shown that in air-breathing freshwater snails of the genus \"Lymnaea\" goal-directed decision-making during the hunt for food is performed by just two neuron types. Through measuring the action potentials between neurons, the researchers found that just two neurons were able to come to a complicated form of decision making. One neuron in the brain tells the snail if food is nearby, the second neuron signals whether the snail is hungry or not. Such decision making helps the snail save energy by reducing complex brain activity when there is no food nearby and adapts its behavior in the absence of food. Thus the snail can switch between a low-use mode and a high-use mode depending on the decision.

            "document": "Teleost leptins . The observations that long-term feed restriction does not significantly affect \"lep\" expression in Atlantic salmon has also been noted in other teleosts. However it is likely that prolonged feed restriction can influence several endocrine parameters to adapt to the nutritional condition. For example, in common carp, a rapid response in ob gene expression in hepatic tissue of common carp shortly after feeding, but no changes in expression in response to different long-term feeding regime was observed. These authors suggested that this effect could be explained by the fact that starved fish do not lose weight as rapidly as mammals, a consequence of being ectothermic and possessing a much lower standard metabolic rate, and therefore can withstand longer periods of starvation. A similar study on grass carp showed that chronic injection of species-specific Lep did not affect long-term food intake and body weight, while acute injection decreased food intake. Conversely, Murashita et al., (unpublished results) observed increased proopiomelanocortin a1(\"pomca1\") levels following chronic injection of Lep in Atlantic salmon, which suggests that chronic exposure to elevated Lep levels can decrease food intake through the Pomc pathway in this species. Recent studies in Atlantic salmon did not observe any difference of feed restriction in circulating plasma levels, which contrasts recent results in rainbow trout and suggest that the relation between circulating lep levels and energy status differs from that in mammals. However, salmon RIA appears to allow interspecies assessment of plasma lep levels. This only confirms that more comprehensive studies are needed for conclusive data interpretation. Studies on rainbow trout also implicated Lep as an anorectic hormone as in mammals. Injection of rainbow trout with recombinant trout leptin (\"rt-leptin\") resulted in a significantly reduced appetite over two days that coincided with a decrease in hypothalamic mRNA expression of neuropeptide Y (\"npy\") and increase of \"pomc\" mRNAs, respectively. Whether these observations are due to species-specific differences in long-term leptin regulation of appetite or growth is not known, however, consensus data indicate that the effects of Lep on appetite regulation may be short-term in teleosts.",

Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of strict animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolised as energy over fat when provided, even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat. Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein. Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food. The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.",

The ants' diet consists of dead mammals, arthropods, insects, earthworms, vertebrates, and solid food matter such as seeds. However, this species prefers liquid over solid food. The liquid food the ants collect is sweet substances from plants or honeydew-producing hemipterans. Arthropod prey may include dipteran adults, larvae and pupae, and termites. The consumption of sugar amino acid is known to affect recruitment of workers to plant nectars. Mimic plants with sugar rarely have workers to feed on them, whereas those with sugar and amino acids have considerable numbers. The habitats where they live may determine the food they collect the most; for example, forage success rates for solid foods are highest in lakeshore sites, while high levels of liquid sources were collected from pasture sites. Specific diets can also alter the growth of a colony, with laboratory colonies showing high growth if fed honey-water. Colonies that feed on insects and sugar-water can grow exceptionally large in a short period of time, whereas those that do not feed on sugar-water grow substantially slower. Colonies that do not feed on insects cease brood production entirely. Altogether, the volume of food digested by nestmates is regulated within colonies. Larvae are able to display independent appetites for sources such as solid proteins, amino acid solutions, and sucrose solutions, and they also prefer these sources over dilute solutions. Such behaviour is due to their capability to communicate hunger to workers. The rate of consumption depends on the type, concentration, and state of the food on which they feed. Workers tend to recruit more nestmates to food sources filled with high levels of sucrose than to protein.",
