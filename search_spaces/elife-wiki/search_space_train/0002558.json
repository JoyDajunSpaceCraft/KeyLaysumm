The Drosophila embryonic protein SNAI1, commonly known as Snail, is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor which downregulates the expression of ectodermal genes within the mesoderm. The nuclear protein encoded by this gene is structurally similar to the Drosophila snail protein, and is also thought to be critical for mesoderm formation in the developing embryo. At least two variants of a similar processed pseudogene have been found on chromosome 2. SNAI1 zinc-fingers (ZF) binds to E-box, an E-cadherin promoter region, and represses the expression of the adhesion molecule, which induces the tightly bound epithelial cells to break loose from each other and migrate into the developing embryo to become mesenchymal cells. This process allows for the formation of the mesodermal layer in the developing embryo. Though SNAI1 is shown to repress expression of E-cadherin in epithelial cells, studies have shown homozygous mutant embryos are still able to form a mesodermal layer. However, the mesodermal layer present shows characteristics of epithelial cells and not mesenchymal cells (the mutant mesoderm cells exhibited a polarized state). Other studies show that mutation of specific ZFs contribute to a decrease in SNAI1 E-cadherin repression.",

These mRNA molecules are stored to be used later in what will become the developing embryo. The male and female \"Drosophila\" gametes exhibit anisogamy (differences in morphology and sub-cellular biochemistry). The female gamete is larger than the male gamete because it harbors more cytoplasm and, within the cytoplasm, the female gamete contains an abundance of the mRNA previously mentioned. At fertilization, the male and female gametes fuse (plasmogamy) and then the nucleus of the male gamete fuses with the nucleus of the female gamete (karyogamy). Note that before the gametes' nuclei fuse, they are known as pronuclei. A series of nuclear divisions will occur without cytokinesis (division of the cell) in the zygote to form a multi-nucleated cell (a cell containing multiple nuclei) known as a syncytium. All the nuclei in the syncytium are identical, just as all the nuclei in every somatic cell of any multicellular organism are identical \"in terms of the DNA sequence of the genome\". Before the nuclei can differentiate in transcriptional activity, the embryo (syncytium) must be divided into segments. In each segment, a unique set of regulatory proteins will cause specific genes in the nuclei to be transcribed. The resulting combination of proteins will transform clusters of cells into early embryo tissues that will each develop into multiple fetal and adult tissues later in development (note: this happens after each nucleus becomes wrapped with its own cell membrane).",

After DNA is transcribed into RNA, the molecule is known as pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) and it consists of exons and introns that can be split apart and rearranged in many different ways. Historically, exons are considered the coding sequence and introns are considered the \u201cjunk\u201d DNA. Although this has been shown to be false, it is true that exons are often merged. Depending on the needs of the cell, regulatory mechanisms choose which exons, and sometimes introns, to join together. This process of removing pieces of a pre- mRNA transcript and combining them with other pieces is called splicing. The human genome encodes approximately 25,000 genes but there are significantly more proteins produced. This is accomplished through RNA splicing. The exons of these 25,000 genes can be spliced in many different ways to create countless combinations of RNA transcripts and ultimately countless proteins. Normally, exons from the same pre-mRNA transcript are spliced together. However, occasionally gene products or pre-mRNA transcripts are spliced together so that exons from different transcripts are mixed together in a fusion product known as chimeric RNA. Chimeric RNA often incorporates exons from highly expressed genes, but the chimeric transcript itself is usually expressed at low levels.",

They also did an in situ hybridization of the BMP4 gene showing green color and Sox2 gene in red which they thought it was involved in the lens formation as well. After they did these two in situ hybridizations in the mice embryos, they found that both green and red colors are found in the optic vesicle of the mice embryos. This indicated that BMP4 and Sox2 are expressed in the right place at the right time of the optic vesicle and prove that they have some essential functions for the lens induction. Furthermore, they did a follow-up experiment that by injecting BMP4 into the BMP4 homozygous mutant embryos rescued the lens formation (12). This indicated that BMP4 is definitely required for lens formation. However, researchers also found that some of the mutated mice cannot be rescued.

X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies.\u00a0 Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called \"sex-lethal\". The gene was named \"sex-lethal\" due to its mutant phenotype which has little to no effect on male flies but results in the death of females due to X hyperactivation of the two X chromosomes. In female \"Drosophila\", the sex-lethal protein causes the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\"gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. This produces a positive feedback loop as the sex-lethal protein splices the \"sex-lethal\" gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. In male \"Drosophila\", there isn\u2019t enough sex-lethal to activate the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\" gene, and it goes through the \"default\" splicing. This means that section of the gene that is spliced out in females remains in males. This portion contains an early stop codon resulting in no protein being made from it. In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the \"male-specific lethal\" (\"msl\") gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The \"msl\" gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the \"msl\" gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the expression of the X chromosome to be \"doubled,\" or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes.",

Other strategies targeting the mutant pre-mRNA by exon skipping and/or spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMaRT) have been evaluated for \"MYBPC3\". Exon skipping can be achieved using antisense oligonucleotide (AON) masking exonic splicing enhancer sequences and therefore preventing binding of the splicing machinery and therefore resulting in exclusion of the exon from the mRNA. This approach can be applied when the resulting shorter, but in-frame translated protein maintains its function. Proof-of-concept of exon skipping was recently shown in homozygous \"Mybpc3\"-targeted knock-in mice. Systemic administration of AAV-based AONs to \"Mybpc3\"-targeted knock-in newborn mice prevented both systolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy, at least for the duration of the investigated period. For the human \"MYBPC3\" gene, skipping of 6 single exons or 5 double exons with specific AONs would result in shortened in-frame cMyBP-Cs, allowing the preservation of the functionally important phosphorylation and protein interaction sites. With this approach, about half of missense or exonic/intronic truncating mutations could be removed, including 35 mutations in exon 25. The other strategy targeting the mutant pre-mRNA is SMaRT. Hereby, two independently transcribed molecules, the mutant pre-mRNA and the therapeutic pre-trans-splicing molecule carrying the wild-type sequence are spliced together to give rise to a repaired full-length mRNA. Recently, the feasibility of this method was shown both in isolated cardiac myocytes and \"in vivo\" in the heart of homozygous \"Mybpc3\"-targeted knock-in mice, although the efficiency of the process was low and the amount of repaired protein was not sufficient to prevent the development of the cardiac disease phenotype. In principle, however, this SmART strategy is superior to exon skipping or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and still attractive, because only two pre-trans-splicing molecules, targeting the 5\u2019 and the 3\u2019 of \"MYBPC3\" pre-mRNA would be sufficient to bypass all \"MYBPC3\" mutations associated with cardiomyopathies and therefore repair the mRNA.",

Studies using Fgf4 gene knockout mice showed developmental defects in embryos both in vivo and in vitro, revealing that FGF4 facilitates the survival and growth of the inner cell mass during the postimplantation phase of development by acting as an autocrine or paracrine ligand. FGFs produced in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) are critical for the proper forelimb and hindlimb outgrowth. FGF signaling in the AER is involved in regulating limb digit number and cell death in the interdigital mesenchyme. When FGF signaling dynamics and regulatory processes are altered, postaxial polydactyly and cutaneous syndactyly, two phenotypic abnormalities collectively known as polysyndactyly, can occur in the limbs. Polysyndactyly is observed when an excess of Fgf4 is expressed in limb buds of wild-type mice. In mutant limb buds that do not express Fgf8, the expression of Fgf4 still results in polysyndactyly, but Fgf4 is also able to rescue all skeletal defects that arise from the lack of Fgf8. Therefore, the Fgf4 gene compensates for the loss of the Fgf8 gene, revealing that FGF4 and FGF8 perform similar functions in limb skeleton patterning and limb development. Studies of zebrafish Fgf4 knockdown embryos demonstrated that when Fgf4 signaling is inhibited, randomized left-right patterning of the liver, pancreas, and heart takes place, showing that Fgf4 is a crucial gene involved in developing left-right patterning of visceral organs. Furthermore, unlike the role of FGF4 in limb development, FGF4 and FGF8 have distinct roles and function independently in the process of visceral organ left-right patterning. Fgf signaling pathway has also been demonstrated to drive hindgut identity during gastrointestinal development, and the up regulation of the Fgf4 in pluripotent stem cell has been used to direct their differentiation for the generation of intestinal Organoids and tissues in vitro.",

After DNA is transcribed into RNA, the molecule is known as pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) and it consists of exons and introns that can be split apart and rearranged in many different ways. Historically, exons are considered the coding sequence and introns are considered the \u201cjunk\u201d DNA. Although this has been shown to be false, it is true that exons are often merged. Depending on the needs of the cell, regulatory mechanisms choose which exons, and sometimes introns, to join together. This process of removing pieces of a pre- mRNA transcript and combining them with other pieces is called splicing. The human genome encodes approximately 25,000 genes but there are significantly more proteins produced. This is accomplished through RNA splicing. The exons of these 25,000 genes can be spliced in many different ways to create countless combinations of RNA transcripts and ultimately countless proteins. Normally, exons from the same pre-mRNA transcript are spliced together. However, occasionally gene products or pre-mRNA transcripts are spliced together so that exons from different transcripts are mixed together in a fusion product known as chimeric RNA.

The mutation can be an insertion, deletion, frame shift, etc.  The splicing process itself is controlled by the given sequences, known as splice-donor and splice-acceptor sequences, which surround each exon. Mutations in these sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic DNA by the mRNA, or to entire exons being spliced out of the mRNA.

Spliceosomes assemble on and around splice sites (the boundaries between introns and exons in the unspliced pre-mRNA) in mRNA precursors and use RNA-RNA interactions to identify critical nucleotide sequences and, probably, to catalyze the splicing reactions. Nuclear pre-mRNA introns and spliceosome-associated snRNAs show similar structural features to self-splicing group II introns. In addition, the splicing pathway of nuclear pre-mRNA introns and group II introns shares a similar reaction pathway. These similarities have led to the hypothesis that these molecules may share a common ancestor.",

It was discovered in 1998 by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, who won the Nobel Prize for their discovery in 2006. The process to silence genes first begins with the entrance of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule into the cell, which triggers the RNAi pathway. The double-stranded molecule is then cut into small double-stranded fragments by an enzyme called Dicer. These small fragments, which include small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), are approximately 21\u201323 nucleotides in length. The fragments integrate into a multi-subunit protein called the RNA-induced silencing complex, which contains Argonaute proteins that are essential components of the RNAi pathway. One strand of the molecule, called the \"guide\" strand, binds to RISC, while the other strand, known as the \"passenger\" strand is degraded. The guide or antisense strand of the fragment that remains bound to RISC directs the sequence-specific silencing of the target mRNA molecule. The genes can be silenced by siRNA molecules that cause the endonucleatic cleavage of the target mRNA molecules or by miRNA molecules that suppress translation of the mRNA molecule. With the cleavage or translational repression of the mRNA molecules, the genes that form them are essentially inactive. RNAi is thought to have evolved as a cellular defense mechanism against invaders, such as RNA viruses, or to combat the proliferation of transposons within a cell's DNA. Both RNA viruses and transposons can exist as double-stranded RNA and lead to the activation of RNAi. Currently, siRNAs are being widely used to suppress specific gene expression and to assess the function of genes. Companies utilizing this approach include Alnylam, Sanofi, Arrowhead, Discerna, and Persomics, among others.",

The unintentional removal of an exon from the final mRNA product is termed exon skipping. Therefore, there is a decreased level of functional IKAP protein expression within affected tissue. However, this disorder is tissue-specific. Lymphoblasts, even with the mutation present, may continue to express some functional IKAP protein. In contrast, brain tissue with the single-base mutation in the IKBKAP gene predominantly express a resulting truncated, mutant IKAP protein which is nonfunctional. The exact mechanism for how the familial dysautonomia phenotype is induced due to reduced IKAP expression is unclear; still, as a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, there have been a variety of proposed mechanisms. One such theory suggests that critical genes in the development of wild-type sensory and autonomic neurons are improperly transcribed.

In molecular genetics, the three prime untranslated region (3'-UTR) is the section of messenger RNA (mRNA) that immediately follows the translation termination codon. An mRNA molecule is transcribed from the DNA sequence and is later translated into protein. Several regions of the mRNA molecule are not translated into protein including the 5' cap, 5' untranslated region, 3' untranslated region, and the poly(A) tail. The 3'-UTR often contains regulatory regions that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. Regulatory regions within the 3'-untranslated region can influence polyadenylation, translation efficiency, localization, and stability of the mRNA. The 3'-UTR contains both binding sites for regulatory proteins as well as microRNAs (miRNAs). By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also has silencer regions which bind to repressor proteins and will inhibit the expression of the mRNA. Many 3'-UTRs also contain AU-rich elements (AREs). Proteins bind AREs to affect the stability or decay rate of transcripts in a localized manner or affect translation initiation. Furthermore, the 3'-UTR contains the sequence AAUAAA that directs addition of several hundred adenine residues called the poly(A) tail to the end of the mRNA transcript. Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds to this tail, contributing to regulation of mRNA translation, stability, and export. For example, poly (A) tail bound PABP interacts with proteins associated with the 5' end of the transcript, causing a circularization of the mRNA that promotes translation. The 3'-UTR can also contain sequences that attract proteins to associate the mRNA with the cytoskeleton, transport it to or from the cell nucleus, or perform other types of localization. In addition to sequences within the 3'-UTR, the physical characteristics of the region, including its length and secondary structure, contribute to translation regulation. These diverse mechanisms of gene regulation ensure that the correct genes are expressed in the correct cells at the appropriate times.",

Other strategies targeting the mutant pre-mRNA by exon skipping and/or spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMaRT) have been evaluated for \"MYBPC3\". Exon skipping can be achieved using antisense oligonucleotide (AON) masking exonic splicing enhancer sequences and therefore preventing binding of the splicing machinery and therefore resulting in exclusion of the exon from the mRNA. This approach can be applied when the resulting shorter, but in-frame translated protein maintains its function. Proof-of-concept of exon skipping was recently shown in homozygous \"Mybpc3\"-targeted knock-in mice. Systemic administration of AAV-based AONs to \"Mybpc3\"-targeted knock-in newborn mice prevented both systolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy, at least for the duration of the investigated period. For the human \"MYBPC3\" gene, skipping of 6 single exons or 5 double exons with specific AONs would result in shortened in-frame cMyBP-Cs, allowing the preservation of the functionally important phosphorylation and protein interaction sites. With this approach, about half of missense or exonic/intronic truncating mutations could be removed, including 35 mutations in exon 25. The other strategy targeting the mutant pre-mRNA is SMaRT. Hereby, two independently transcribed molecules, the mutant pre-mRNA and the therapeutic pre-trans-splicing molecule carrying the wild-type sequence are spliced together to give rise to a repaired full-length mRNA. Recently, the feasibility of this method was shown both in isolated cardiac myocytes and \"in vivo\" in the heart of homozygous \"Mybpc3\"-targeted knock-in mice, although the efficiency of the process was low and the amount of repaired protein was not sufficient to prevent the development of the cardiac disease phenotype. In principle, however, this SmART strategy is superior to exon skipping or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and still attractive, because only two pre-trans-splicing molecules, targeting the 5\u2019 and the 3\u2019 of \"MYBPC3\" pre-mRNA would be sufficient to bypass all \"MYBPC3\" mutations associated with cardiomyopathies and therefore repair the mRNA.",
