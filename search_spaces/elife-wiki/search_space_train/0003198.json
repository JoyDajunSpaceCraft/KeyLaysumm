Across species, different sexes are often characterized by different types and numbers of sex chromosomes. In order to account for varying numbers of sex chromosomes, different organisms have acquired unique methods to equalize gene expression amongst the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of genes, different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to cope with this inequality. Replicating the actual \"gene\" is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the \"expression\" from each gene. For example, in humans, females (XX) silence the transcription of one X chromosome of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes.",

X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies.\u00a0 Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called \"sex-lethal\". The gene was named \"sex-lethal\" due to its mutant phenotype which has little to no effect on male flies but results in the death of females due to X hyperactivation of the two X chromosomes. In female \"Drosophila\", the sex-lethal protein causes the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\"gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. This produces a positive feedback loop as the sex-lethal protein splices the \"sex-lethal\" gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. In male \"Drosophila\", there isn\u2019t enough sex-lethal to activate the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\" gene, and it goes through the \"default\" splicing. This means that section of the gene that is spliced out in females remains in males. This portion contains an early stop codon resulting in no protein being made from it. In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the \"male-specific lethal\" (\"msl\") gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The \"msl\" gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the \"msl\" gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the expression of the X chromosome to be \"doubled,\" or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes.",

As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of \"Drosophila\". However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as \u201cless effective\u201d at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans.

In this genome-wide survey, the scientists found that autosomal genes are more likely to undergo nonsense-mediated decay than X-linked genes. This is because NMD fine tunes X chromosomes and it was demonstrated by inhibiting the pathway. The results were that balanced gene expression between X and autosomes gene expression was decreased by 10\u201315% no matter the method of inhibition.

Regardless of their ambiguous evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system, with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus has yet to be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.",

People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Females typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY). 48,XXYY syndrome results from the presence of an extra copy of both sex chromosomes in each of a male's cells (48,XXYY). Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome interfere with male sexual development, preventing the testes from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Many genes are found only on the X or Y chromosome, but genes in areas known as the pseudoautosomal regions are present on both sex chromosomes. Extra copies of genes from the pseudoautosomal regions of the extra X and Y chromosome contribute to the signs and symptoms of 48,XXYY syndrome; however, the specific genes have not been identified.  The condition 48,XXYY is not inherited; it usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. In 48,XXYY syndrome, the extra sex chromosomes almost always come from a sperm cell. Nondisjunction may cause a sperm cell to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a sperm cell with three sex chromosomes (one X and two Y chromosomes). If that sperm cell fertilizes a normal egg cell with one X chromosome, the resulting child will have two X chromosomes and two Y chromosomes in each of his body's cells.",

It is associated with female-specific hyper-acetylation of lysine 16 on histone 4 near the MHM locus on the Z chromosome. This MHM locus is heavily studied as a site of dosage compensation because male Z chromosomes are hypermethylated and thus underexpress genes in this area in comparison to female Z chromosomes which are hyperacetylated and overexpress these genes. There has been debate on whether the MHM locus constitutes dosage compensation, however, since scientists claim that even if the MHM locus has been found to have significantly greater expression in females than in males, it could not even be considered to be a dosage compensation mechanism since it does not balance gene dose between the Z chromosome and autosomes in the heterogametic sex.",

The name \u201cMSL\u201d is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male \"Drosophila\". The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family\u2014maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3\u2014are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread along the length of the chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications.

However, not all species depend upon the W for their sex. For example, there are moths and butterflies that are ZW, but some have been found female with ZO, as well as female with ZZW. Also, while mammals deactivate one of their extra X chromosomes when female, it appears that in the case of Lepidoptera, the males produce double the normal amount of enzymes, due to having two Z's. Because the use of ZW sex determination is varied, it is still unknown how exactly most species determine their sex. However, reportedly, the silkworm \"Bombyx mori\" uses a single female-specific piRNA as the primary determiner of sex.

As Sue Hubble stated in her book \"Shrinking the Cat: Genetic Engineering before We Knew about Genes\",  The mutation that gives male cats a ginger-colored coat and females ginger, tortoiseshell, or calico coats produced a particularly telling map. The orange mutant gene is found only on the X, or female, chromosome. As with humans, female cats have paired sex chromosomes, XX, and male cats have XY sex chromosomes. The female cat, therefore, can have the orange mutant gene on one X chromosome and the gene for a black coat on the other. The piebald gene is on a different chromosome. If expressed, this gene codes for white, or no color, and is dominant over the alleles that code for a certain color (\"i.e.\" orange or black), making the white spots on calico cats. If that is the case, those several genes will be expressed in a blotchy coat of the tortoiseshell or calico kind. But the male, with his single X chromosome, has only one of that particular coat-color gene: he can be not-ginger or he can be ginger (although some modifier genes can add a bit of white here and there), but unless he has a chromosomal abnormality he cannot be a calico cat. It is currently impossible to reproduce the fur patterns of calico cats by cloning. Penelope Tsernoglou wrote \"This is due to an effect called x-linked inactivation which involves the random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes. Since all female mammals have two X chromosomes, one might wonder if this phenomenon could have a more widespread impact on cloning in the future.\"",

Females have two X chromosomes, and hence redundant copies of the blood clotting factor gene located on them. A female who inherits a mutated copy on one X chromosome has also inherited a second X chromosome from the other parent that is likely to carry a non-mutated copy of the gene, capable of directing appropriate clotting. Such a female, with normal clotting but possessing a single mutated copy of the gene, is called a carrier. Males only possess a single X chromosome, inherited from their mother, having received a Y chromosome from their father instead of a second X. If their sole X chromosome contains the haemophilia mutation they possess no second copy to provide for normal function, as in carrier females. Each child of a carrier will have a 50% chance of inheriting their mother's mutation, of being a haemophiliac (sons) or carrier (daughters).

X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies.\u00a0 Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called \"sex-lethal\". The gene was named \"sex-lethal\" due to its mutant phenotype which has little to no effect on male flies but results in the death of females due to X hyperactivation of the two X chromosomes. In female \"Drosophila\", the sex-lethal protein causes the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\"gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. This produces a positive feedback loop as the sex-lethal protein splices the \"sex-lethal\" gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. In male \"Drosophila\", there isn\u2019t enough sex-lethal to activate the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\" gene, and it goes through the \"default\" splicing. This means that section of the gene that is spliced out in females remains in males. This portion contains an early stop codon resulting in no protein being made from it. In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the \"male-specific lethal\" (\"msl\") gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The \"msl\" gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the \"msl\" gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the expression of the X chromosome to be \"doubled,\" or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes.",

Because the entire genome of the platypus has yet to be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds.

It can be caused by primary nonrandom inactivation, either by chance due to a small cell pool or directed by genes, or caused by secondary nonrandom inactivation, which occurs by selection. Most females will have some levels of skewing. It is relatively common in adult females; around 35% of women have a skewed ratio over 70:30, and 7% of women have an extreme skewed ratio of over 90:10. This is of medical significance due to the potential for the expression of disease genes present on the X chromosome that are normally not expressed due to random X inactivation. X chromosome inactivation occurs in females to provide dosage compensation between the sexes. If females kept both X chromosomes active they would have twice the number of active X genes than males, who only have one copy of the X chromosome. At approximately the time of implantation (see Implantation (human embryo)), one of the two X chromosomes in each cell of the female embryo is randomly selected for inactivation.

Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of \"Drosophila\". However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as \u201cless effective\u201d at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans.

In the case of two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome, there is no use for a Barr body, and the male organism must use different genetic machinery to increase the transcriptional output of their single X chromosome. It is common in such organisms for the Y chromosome to be necessary for male fertility, but not for it to play an explicit role in sex determination. In \"Drosophila\", for example, the sex lethal (SXL) gene acts as a key regulator of sexual differentiation and maturation in somatic tissue; in XX animals, SXL is activated to repress increased transcription, while in XY animals SXL is inactive and allows male development to proceed via increased transcription of the single X. Several binding sites exist on the \"Drosophila\" X chromosome for the dosage compensation complex (DCC), a ribonucleoprotein complex; these binding sites have varying levels of affinity, presumably for varying expression of specific genes. The Male Specific Lethal complex, composed of protein and RNA binds and selectively modifies hundreds of X-linked genes, increasing their transcription to levels comparable to female \"D. melanogaster\".",

Instead of silencing the entire chromosome as humans do, male chickens (the model ZZ organism) seem to engage in selective Z silencing, in which they silence only certain genes on the extra Z chromosome. Thus, male chickens express an average of 1.4-1.6 of the Z chromosome DNA expressed by female chickens. The Z chromosome expression of male zebra finches and chickens is higher than the autosomal expression rates, whereas X chromosome expression in female humans is equal to autosomal expression rates, illustrating clearly that both male chickens and male zebra finches practice incomplete silencing. Few other ZZ/ZW Systems have been analyzed as thoroughly as the chicken; however a recent study on silkworms revealed similar levels of unequal compensation across male Z chromosomes. Z-specific genes were over-expressed in males when compared to females, and a few genes had equal expression in both male and female Z chromosomes.",

In organisms that use this method of dosage compensation, the presence of one or more X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate dosage compensation mechanisms is lethal. Male specific lethal proteins (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name \u201cMSL\u201d is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male \"Drosophila\". The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family\u2014maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3\u2014are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread along the length of the chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. The implications of this spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.",

Meyer in the 1980s, and its individual components and their cooperative function were later parsed out by her lab. Notably, in 1999, data from Meyer\u2019s lab showed that SDC-2 is a particularly important transcriptional factor for targeting the DCC to the X chromosome and for assembling DCC components onto the X chromosomes in XX embryos. More recently, Meyer\u2019s lab has shown that proteins known as X-linked signal elements (XSEs) operate in concert with SDC-2 to differentially repress and activate other genes in the dosage compensation pathway. By selectively mutating a panel of genes hypothesized to contribute to dosage compensation in worms, Meyer\u2019s group demonstrated which XSEs specifically play a role in determining normal dosage compensation. They found that during embryonic development, several X-linked genes\u2014including sex-1, sex-2, fox-1, and ceh-39\u2014act in a combinatorial fashion to selectively repress transcriptional activity of the xol-1 gene in hermaphrodites. Xol-1 expression is tightly regulated during early development, and is considered the most upstream gene in sex determination of C. elegans. In fact, xol-1 is often referred to in the literature as the master sex regulatory gene of C. elegans. XX C. elegans embryos have much lower xol-1 expression than their XO counterparts, resulting from overall increases in the amount of SEX-1, SEX-2, CEH-39, and FOX-1 transcription produced in the female embryos. This consequent decrease in xol-1 expression then allows higher SDC-2 expression levels, which aids in the formation and function of the DCC complex in the XX hermaphroditic worms, and in turn results in equalized expression of X-linked genes in the hermaphrodite.",

While the epigenetic mechanisms behind dosage compensation in birds are poorly understood, especially in comparison to the well-studied mechanisms of dosage compensation in humans and \"Drosophila\", several recent studies have revealed promising sequences.

It is associated with female-specific hyper-acetylation of lysine 16 on histone 4 near the MHM locus on the Z chromosome. This MHM locus is heavily studied as a site of dosage compensation because male Z chromosomes are hypermethylated and thus underexpress genes in this area in comparison to female Z chromosomes which are hyperacetylated and overexpress these genes. There has been debate on whether the MHM locus constitutes dosage compensation, however, since scientists claim that even if the MHM locus has been found to have significantly greater expression in females than in males, it could not even be considered to be a dosage compensation mechanism since it does not balance gene dose between the Z chromosome and autosomes in the heterogametic sex.",

If expressed, this gene codes for white, or no color, and is dominant over the alleles that code for a certain color (\"i.e.\" orange or black), making the white spots on calico cats. If that is the case, those several genes will be expressed in a blotchy coat of the tortoiseshell or calico kind.
