The forced over-expression of CYP2J2 in or the addition of an EET to cultured human Tca-8113 oral squamous cancer cells, lung cancer A549 cells and NCL-H446 cells, HepG2 liver cancer cells, LS-174 colon cancer cells, SiHa uterine cervix cancer cells, U251 glioblastoma cancer cells, ScaBER urinary bladder cancer cells, and K562 erythroleukemia and HL-60 promyelocyte leukemic blood cancer cells caused an increase in their survival and proliferation.  Putative inhibitors of CYP2J2 inhibit the growth in culture of several human cancer cell lines that express relatively high levels of CYP2J2 viz., Tca-8113 cells, HeLa uterine cervix cell lines, A549 cells, MDA-MB-435 breast cells, and HepG2 cells but they had no significant inhibitory effects on two cell lines that expressed little or no CYP2J2.  A putative inhibitor of CYPJ2 also inhibited the growth of human K562 erythroleukemia in a mice model as well as the growth of mouse el4 lymphoma cells in mice that were forced to overexpress CYP2J2 cells in their vascular epithelium.  Forced expression of CYP2J2 also enhanced, while forced inhibition of its expression (using Small interfering RNA) reduced, the survival, growth, and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells in the mouse model and likewise enhanced or reduced, respectively, the survival and growth of these cells in culture.  Further studies found that the expression of CYP2J2 was in increased in the malignant cells, relative to the nearby normal cells, in the following specimens taken from humans suffering squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma types of esophageal cancer and lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, breast cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and colon adenocarcinoma;  this CYP was also highly expressed in the malignant cells of patients with acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, and lymphoma.  As a group, patients with these cancers exhibited increased levels of EETs in their urine and blood samples. Studies of the CYP epoxygenases have not been restricted to the CYP2J subfamily.  Reduction in the expression of CYP3A4 or CYP2C using small interfering RNA inhibits the growth of cultured MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells; in these studies 14,15-EET stimulated the proliferation of cultured MCF7 cells, reduction in the expression of CYP3A4 by small interference RNA methods, inhibited these cells from proliferating, and 14,15-ETE reversed the effect of CYP3A4 interference;  in other studies, the forced overexpression of CYP3A4 stimulated the growth of human liver cancer (hepatoma) cell line, Hep3 .  In human breast cancer, not only CYP2J2 but also CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 levels appear elevated while sEH levels appear reduced in malignant compared to nearby normal tissues; associated with this finding, the levels of 14,15-EET as well as the levels of 14,15-EET plus 14,15-dihydroxy-EET were significantly elevated in the cancerous compared to noncancerous cells and the levels of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 proteins correlated positively and sEH levels correlated negatively with the tumor cells rate of proliferation as accessed by their Ki67 levels while CYP2J2 levels correlated positively with poorer prognosis as predicted tumor histological grade and tumor size.",

However, researchers utilize these cells to study the development of cancer cells in order to find more specific treatments. For developmental biologists, embryonal carcinoma, which is derived from teratocarcinoma, is a good object for developmental study. In 1982, McBurney and Rogers transplanted a 7.5 day mouse embryo into the testis to induce tumor growth. Cell cultures containing undifferentiatied stem cells were isolated from the primary tumor which have a euploid karyotype. These stem cells were named embryonal carcinoma P19 cells. These derived P19 cells grew rapidly without feeder cells and were easy to maintain. Moreover, the multipotency of P19 cells was then confirmed by injecting the cells into blastocysts of another mouse strain. The researchers found that there were tissues from all three germ layers growing in the recipient mouse. Based on their continuous studies, they further derived subtype cell lines from original P19 cells: P19S18, P19D3, P19RAC65 and P19C16. The difference between these subtype cell lines is the ability to differentiate into neuronal cells or muscle cells in response to treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO, respectively. More recently, various studies generate cell lines that were initially derived from differentiated P19 cells. Due to the pluripotency of P19 cells, those new derived cell lines can be ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm-like cells.",

The isoform SIM2 Short (SIM2s) has been shown to be specifically expressed in mammary gland tissue. SIM2s is a splice variant which lacks exon 11 of SIM2. It has been researched that SIM2s acts in mammary gland development and has tumor suppressive characteristics specifically in breast cancer. In a mouse specimen, when SIM2s was not expressed in mammary epithelial cells there were development defects leading to cancer-like characteristics in the cells. The defects were increased cell proliferation, cellular invasion of local stroma, loss of cellular polarity, and loss of E-cadherin cellular adhesion molecules. These observations suggest that SIM2s is essential for proper mammary gland development. Experiments reintroducing SIM2s in human breast cancer cells allowed for the tumor suppressive characteristics to be observed. Comparing normal human breast cells to human breast cancer cells with immunohistochemical staining showed that SIM2s was expressed more in the normal than the cancerous. Reintroducing SIM2s expression in breast cancer cells showed a decrease in growth, proliferation, and invasiveness. SIM2s represses the actions of the matrix metalloprotease-3 gene (MMP3) which include cell migration, cancer progression, and epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT). SIM2s also represses the SLUG transcription factor which in turn suppresses EMT. EMT suppression allows for E-cadherin to remain and for the cell to not undergo pathological EMT associated with tumor formation. These actions show the tumor suppressive effects of SIM2s in mammary epithelium.",

Tumstatin binds to the endothelium of the tumor and is thus able to affect tumor growth. By affecting the apoptotic pathway, tumstatin inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells. Tumstatin is a cell-specific inhibitor for protein synthesis and therefore affects angiogenesis, which occurs at the protein synthesis level. It has been shown that the efficacy of tumstatin in reducing angiogenesis in tumors increases with tumor size (tumors larger than 500\u00a0mm\u00b3).  In addition to limiting the proliferation of endothelial cells, tumstatin also limits angiogenesis in melanoma cells. The 54-132 amino acid sequence of the tumstatin fragment binds both endothelial and melanoma cells but only inhibits endothelial cell proliferation which the 185-203 amino acid sequence also binds both and inhibits only melanoma proliferation.

In many types of cancer, the rate at which tumors shrink following chemotherapy is related to the rate of tumor growth before treatment. Tumors that grow rapidly are generally more sensitive to the toxic effects that conventional anticancer drugs have on the cancer cells. Many conventional anticancer drugs (for example, 5-Fluorouracil) interfere with DNA replication and can cause the death of cells that attempt to replicate their DNA and divide. A rapidly growing tumor will have more actively dividing cells and more cell death upon exposure to such anticancer drugs. In the example shown in Figure 2, a tumor is found after the cell growth rate has slowed. Most of the cancer cells are removed by surgery. The remaining cancer cells begin to proliferate rapidly and cancer chemotherapy is started. Many tumor cells are killed by the chemotherapy, but eventually some cancer cells that are resistant to the chemotherapy drug begin to grow rapidly.

Untransformed human cells exhibit normal cellular behavior and mediate their growth and proliferation via interplay between environmental nutrients, growth factor signaling, and cell density. As cell density increases and the culture becomes confluent, they initiate cell cycle arrest and downregulate proliferation and mitogen signaling pathways regardless of external factors or cellular metabolism. This property is known as contact inhibition of proliferation and is essential to proper embryonic development, as well as tissue repair, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Cancerous cells typically lose this property and thus divide and grow over each other in an uncontrolled manner even when in contact with neighbouring cells. This results in the invasion of surrounding tissues, their metastasis to nearby organs, and eventually tumorigenesis. Interestingly, cells of naked mole rats, a species in which cancer has never been observed, show hypersensitivity to contact inhibition. This finding may provide a clue to cancer resistance. Furthermore, recent studies have further revealed some mechanisms of contact inhibition of proliferation and its potential implications in cancer therapy.",

In normal cells, TGF-\u03b2, acting through its signaling pathway, stops the cell cycle at the G1 stage to stop proliferation, induce differentiation, or promote apoptosis. In many cancer cells, parts of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway are mutated, and TGF-\u03b2 no longer controls the cell. These cancer cells proliferate. The surrounding stromal cells (fibroblasts) also proliferate. Both cells increase their production of TGF-\u03b2. This TGF-\u03b2 acts on the surrounding stromal cells, immune cells, endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. It causes immunosuppression and angiogenesis, which makes the cancer more invasive. TGF-\u03b2 also converts effector T-cells, which normally attack cancer with an inflammatory (immune) reaction, into regulatory (suppressor) T-cells, which turn off the inflammatory reaction. Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between different cell types that express adhesion molecules and secrete cytokines. Disruption of these feedback mechanisms in cancer damages a tissue. When TGF-\u03b2 signaling fails to control NF-\u03baB activity in cancer cells, this has at least two potential effects: first, it enables the malignant tumor to persist in the presence of activated immune cells, and second, the cancer cell outlasts immune cells because it survives in the presence of apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory mediators.",

In fact, breast cancer tissue has been reported to be as much as ten times stiffer than normal tissue. Furthermore, a growing and metastasizing tumor involves the cooperation of many different cell types, like fibroblasts and endothelial cells, that possess different rigidities and could result in local stiffness gradients that guide cell migration. There is increasing evidence that durotaxis plays a role in cancer metastasis. Experiments in mice have demonstrated that tumor cells preferentially invade into the adjacent stroma along stiff collagen fibers. Interestingly, these stiff collagen alignments can be used to identify focal sites of breast tumor cell microinvasion. Pregnancy, which has various links to breast cancer incidence and prognosis, involves postpartum breast involution that relies on collagen remodeling and inflammation that converts these collagen fibers into stiffer counterparts, thus establishing a potential link between pregnancy and metastatic properties. Though some research shows that stiffer tumors are indicative of increased metastasis and decreased survival (which contradicts the concept that durotactic cells should be more attracted to the tumor and metastasize less), this is not counter intuitive because collagen-dependent integrin signaling has a wide range of consequences beyond durotaxis, including inhibition of the tumor suppressor PTEN via upregulation of the miRNA miR-18a.

There have been studies that use a protein-cerium complex to observe the effect of cerium on the cancer cells. The hope was to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cytotoxicity. Transferrin receptors in cancer cells, such as those in breast cancer cells and epithelial cervical cells, promote the cell proliferation and malignancy of the cancer. Transferrin is a protein used to transport iron into the cells and is needed to aid the cancer cells in DNA replication. Transferrin acts as a growth factor for the cancerous cells and is dependent on iron. Cancer cells have much higher levels of transferrin receptors than normal cells and are very dependent on iron for their proliferation. Cerium has shown results as an anti-cancer agent due to its similarities in structure and biochemistry to iron. Cerium may bind in the place of iron on to the transferrin and then be brought into the cancer cells by transferrin-receptor mediated endocytosis. The cerium binding to the transferrin in place of the iron inhibits the transferrin activity in the cell. This creates a toxic environment for the cancer cells and causes a decrease in cell growth. This is the proposed mechanism for cerium\u2019s effect on cancer cells, though the real mechanism may be more complex in how cerium inhibits cancer cell proliferation.

Integrin-mediated adhesion between cancer cells and osteoclasts in bone metastases induces phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in osteoclasts, which in turn induces osteoclast differentiation and survival. Metastatic breast-cancer cells excrete lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) which binds to receptors on tumor cells, inducing cell proliferation and release of cytokines(IL-6 and IL-8, potent bone resorptive agents) and stimulating bone resorption. After the breast-cancer cells have left the primary tumor, they interact with the bone microenvironment and secrete osteolytic factors capable of osteoclast formation and bone resorption.

Initially Chk1 was thought to function as a tumor suppressor due to the regulatory role it serves amongst cells with DNA damage. However, there has been no evidence of homozygous loss of function mutants for Chk1 in human tumors. Instead, Chk1 has been shown to be overexpressed in a numerous tumors including breast, colon, liver, gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. There is a positive correlation with Chk1 expression and tumor grade and disease recurrence suggesting Chk1 may promote tumor growth. Chk1 is essential for cell survival and through high levels of expressions in tumors the function may be inducing tumor cell proliferation. Further, a study has demonstrated that targeting CHK1 reactivates the tumour suppressive activity of protein phosphtase 2A (PP2A) complex in cancer cells. Studies have shown complete loss of Chk1 suppresses chemically induce carcinogenesis however Chk1 haploinsufficiency results in tumor progression. Due to the possibility of Chk1 involvement in tumor promotion, the kinase and related signaling molecules may be potentially effective therapeutic targets. Cancer therapies utilize DNA damaging therapies such as chemotherapies and ionizing radiation to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest. Tumor cells with increased levels of Chk1 acquire survival advantages due to the ability to tolerate a higher level of DNA damage. Therefore, Chk1 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. In order to optimize chemotherapies, Chk1 must be inhibited to reduce the survival advantage. Chk1 gene can be effectively silenced by siRNA knockdown for further analysis based on an independent validation. By inhibiting Chk1, cancer cells lose the ability to repair damaged DNA which allows chemotherapeutic agents to work more effectively. Combining DNA damaging therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation treatment with Chk1 inhibition enhances targeted cell death and provides synthetic lethality. Many cancers rely on Chk1 mediated cell cycle arrest heavily especially if cancers are deficient in p53. Approximately 50% of cancers possess p53 mutations illustrating the dependence that many cancers may have on the Chk1 pathway. Inhibition of Chk1 allows selective targeting of p53 mutant cells as Chk1 levels are more likely to highly expressed in tumor cells with p53 deficiencies. Even though this method of inhibition is highly targeted, recent research has shown Chk1 also has a role in the normal cell cycle. Therefore, off-target effects and toxicity associated with combination therapies using CHk1 inhibitors must be considered during development of novel therapies.",

This process starts by injecting a mouse (or other mammal) with an antigen that provokes an immune response. A type of white blood cell, the B cell that produces antibodies that bind to the antigen are then harvested from the mouse. These isolated B cells are in turn fused with immortal B cell cancer cells, a myeloma, to produce a hybrid cell line called a hybridoma, which has both the antibody-producing ability of the B-cell and the exaggerated longevity and reproductivity of the myeloma. The hybridomas can be grown in culture, each culture starting with one viable hybridoma cell, producing cultures each of which consists of genetically identical hybridomas which produce one antibody per culture (monoclonal) rather than mixtures of different antibodies (polyclonal). The myeloma cell line that is used in this process is selected for its ability to grow in tissue culture and for an absence of antibody synthesis. In contrast to polyclonal antibodies, which are mixtures of many different antibody molecules, the monoclonal antibodies produced by each hybridoma line are all chemically identical.",

Through examining skin cancer in mice, she concluded that the speed at which stem cells will divide and how they divide is dependent on their niche. For example, she examined the inhibitory signaling molecule, TGF-beta, which is found near the blood vessels of a tumor. The effects of TGF-beta and how it restrains normal skin cell growth had been studied by researchers before Fuchs. However, she specifically looked at the intermediate steps of tumor progression by creating a TGF-beta reporter system. She accomplished this by developing tumors that expressed a gene commonly found in skin cancer cells, HRasD12V. Her research demonstrated that the cancerous stem cells lacking the TGF-beta are unable to stop growing, but, however, they are sensitive to antiproliferative drugs. This is unlike the cancerous stem cells which do contain TGF-beta. They were found to be resistant to aniproliferative drugs, although they grow at a much slower rate. They found, in other words, that TGF-beta responding cells are still malignant in their slow proliferative state but are actually resistant to chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin.

ZnPP is known as a competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase. Heme oxygenase is a cytoprotective enzyme that copes with oxidative stress on a cell and shows higher expression in cancerous tissues. ZnPP suppression of heme oxygenase reduces cell viability of cancer cells and increases cytotoxicity in cancer cells. ZnPP works in combination with anticancer drugs to increase cytotoxicity greatly in some cases; results in one study have shown a five-fold increase in treatment efficacy. ZnPP has been shown to have a major role in inhibiting tumor growth especially solid tumors. Tumors from brain cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, oral squamous cell cancer, and leukemia all show a susceptibility to ZnPP due to increase expression of heme oxygenase. The inhibition of heme oxygenase leads to an increase of reactive oxidative species in the cell which sensitizes the cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Increased reactive oxidative species can cause apoptosis in cancer cells and reduce drug resistance when exposed to ZnPP due to loss of the heme oxygenase coping mechanism. The combination of these two therapies is highly effective in treating cancer in experiments thus far, and is a possible new method for overcoming drug resistance. The reduced coping ability of tissues treated with ZnPP also increases radiosensitivity. Cells treated with ZnPP and radiation as opposed to simply one of the two are less viable and more likely to stay in G1 phase of the cell cycle, rather than progress to the G2 phase. ZnPP and radiation combination therapy shows more apoptosis than the same amount of radiation displaying that ZnPP puts stress on cancerous tissue. ZnPP have been injected in a number of trials on solid tumors, but can be utilized more broadly when effectively delivered to cancer cells and not healthy cells. A targeted delivery system is need to fully exploit the uses of ZnPP as a therapeutic agent and heme oxygenase inhibitor due to the potential side effects of free ZnPP on healthy tissue. Reducing the anti-oxidant capability of healthy cells can reduce effects that would have been favorable. However ZnPP have been encapsulated in nanoparticles with specialized coating for drug delivery inside the body. ZnPP did not show any reduce inhibitory potential on heme oxygenase when loaded into nanoparticles. Similarly ZnPP loaded into nanoparticles has a higher cytotoxicity than free ZnPP after two days due to a more favorable release rate as well as better biodistribution and internalization. The possible negative effects on major organs were not seen and blood distribution is more desirable in ZnPP loaded nanoparticles than free ZnPP. The specific inhibition of heme oxygenase using nanoparticles with encapsulated ZnPP reduces side effects and is likely the future method of administering ZnPP treatment.",

PDX models are beneficial for studying therapeutic responses to drugs because multiple therapies can be tested; initial biopsy samples are often divided and implanted into separate mice, giving distinct models for therapy evaluation.

This property is known as contact inhibition of proliferation and is essential to proper embryonic development, as well as tissue repair, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Cancerous cells typically lose this property and thus divide and grow over each other in an uncontrolled manner even when in contact with neighbouring cells. This results in the invasion of surrounding tissues, their metastasis to nearby organs, and eventually tumorigenesis. Interestingly, cells of naked mole rats, a species in which cancer has never been observed, show hypersensitivity to contact inhibition. This finding may provide a clue to cancer resistance.

Growth factors such as bFGF and VEGF can induce capillary growth into the tumor, which some researchers suspect supply required nutrients, allowing for tumor expansion. Unlike normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are dilated with an irregular shape. In 2007, it was discovered that cancerous cells stop producing the anti-VEGF enzyme PKG. In normal cells (but not in cancerous ones), PKG apparently limits beta-catenin, which solicits angiogenesis. Other clinicians believe angiogenesis really serves as a waste pathway, taking away the biological end products secreted by rapidly dividing cancer cells. In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be about the size of the metal ball at the end of a ball-point pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or metastasis. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of endothelial cells and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies. The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and oxygen and a waste disposal pathway.",

The goal of Libutti's research program is to develop novel cancer therapies through a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment. The interaction of a tumor and its vasculature is critical for both tumor growth and the spread of tumor cells to distant organs. The process of new vessel development within the tumor is termed angiogenesis and is required for tumors to grow larger than a few millimeters. In order to better understand the relationship between the tumor and its blood supply, their research is focused on the interaction between tumor-derived factors and endothelial cells developing in the context of the tumor microenvironment. By understanding this interaction they hope to be able to design novel treatment strategies to inhibit both the growth and the spread of tumors. They are currently studying a variety of tumor-derived factors with effects on tumor-associated vasculature. These include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial cell monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II). EMAP-II is a cytokine with potent effects on blood vessels and was discovered by a research team (including Libutti) at Columbia University. Cytokines such as VEGF and EMAP-II appear to be produced in varying amounts by tumors and have direct effects on the tumor neovasculature. Libutti's approach to the study of these interactions has been through the utilization of a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems. His team is using gene expression profiling to understand the changes that occur in endothelial cells exposed to tumor-derived factors. His laboratory is developing techniques, which allow them to isolate endothelial cells from tumor tissue. This has resulted in their ability to study tumor-derived endothelial cells directly, and has led to the observation that tumor associated endothelial cells have epigenetic changes compared to normal endothelial cells from the same tissue type. This approach has also allowed them to identify specific genes such as FILIP1L (formerly DOC1), which appear to play a role in the control of endothelial cell responses to angiogenesis inhibitors. They are also using noninvasive imaging techniques, including dynamic MRI and PET, to map changes in tumor blood flow within tumors both in animal models and in patients on clinical trials. A variety of inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis are being actively studied. These include both recombinant proteins derived from naturally occurring substances as well as small molecules designed to act on specific pathways. Various methods of delivering these agents, including gene therapy approaches and the use of tumor targeted nanoparticles are being pursued. Libutti was the first to administer TNF bound colloidal gold nanoparticles as targeted therapy to cancer patients. The overall goal of Libutti's work is to translate a better understanding of tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions, within the context of the tumor microenvironment, into better therapies for patients with cancer. Dr. Libutti is also studying the role of tumor suppressor genes such as \"MEN1\" in the process of tumor formation. Specifically, deciphering the role of \"MEN1\" in the tissue selective development of tumors is work for which Libutti received an R01 grant from the NCI . Libutti has published over 270 peer reviewed journal articles and currently has a Hirsch Index of 60.

Many conventional anticancer drugs (for example, 5-Fluorouracil) interfere with DNA replication and can cause the death of cells that attempt to replicate their DNA and divide. A rapidly growing tumor will have more actively dividing cells and more cell death upon exposure to such anticancer drugs. In the example shown in Figure 2, a tumor is found after the cell growth rate has slowed. Most of the cancer cells are removed by surgery.

Embryos have three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Each turns into various body parts. The nervous system grows from the ectoderm (which also contributes dental enamel and the epidermis). Ectodermal cells were placed into gel droplets and floated in a nutrient broth in a rotating bioreactor, which supported cell growth without forming by the container. After ten days the organoid developed neurons. After 30 days it displayed regions similar to parts of brains. Lacking a blood supply, cerebral organoids reach about 4\u00a0mm across and can last a year or more. The general procedure can be broken down into 5 steps. First human pluripotent stem cells are cultured. They are then allowed to cultivate into an embryoid body. Next the cell culture is induced to form a neuroectoderm. The neuroectoderm is then grown in a matrigel droplet. The matrigel provides nutrients and the neuroectoderm starts to proliferate and grow. However, the lack of vasculature limits the size the organoid can grow. This has been the major limitation in organoid development, however new methods using a spinning bioreactor have allowed an increase in the availability of nutrients to cells inside the organoid. This last step has been the key breakthrough in organoid development. Spinning bioreactors have been used increasingly in cell culture and tissue growth applications. The reactor is able to deliver faster cell doubling times, increased cell expansion and increased extra-cellular matrix components when compared to statically cultured cells.",

It can develop in many chemically distinct compounds. Until now, several mechanisms are known to develop the resistance. The most common is production of so-called \"efflux pumps\". The pumps remove drugs from tumor cells which lead to low drug concentration in the target, below therapeutic level. Efflux is caused by P-glycoprotein called also the multidrug transporter. This protein is a product of multidrug resistance gene MDR1 and a member of family of ATP-dependent transporters (ATP-binding cassette). P-glycoprotein occurs in every organism and serves to protect the body from xenobiotics and is involved in moving nutrients and other biologically important compounds inside one cell or between cells. P-glycoprotein detects substrates when they enter the plasma membrane and bind them which causes activation of one of the ATP-binding domains. The next step is hydrolysis of ATP, which leads to a change in the shape of P-gp and opens a channel through which the drug is pumped out of the cell. Hydrolysis of a second molecule of ATP results in closing of the channel and the cycle is repeated. P-glycoprotein has affinity to hydrophobic drugs with a positive charge or electrically neutral and is often over-expressed in many human cancers. Some tumors, e.g. lung cancer, do not over-express this transporter but also are able to develop the resistance. It was discovered that another transporter MRP1 also work as the efflux pump, but in this case substrates are negatively charged natural compounds or drugs modified by glutathione, conjugation, glycosylation, sulfation and glucuronylation. Drugs can enter into a cell in few kinds of ways. Major routes are: diffusion across the plasma membrane, through receptor or transporter or by the endocytosis process. Cancer can develop the resistance by mutations to their cells which result in alterations in the surface of cells or in impaired endocytosis. Mutation can eliminate or change transporters or receptors which allows drugs to enter into the tumor cell. Other cause of drug resistance is a mutation in \u03b2 tubulin which cause alterations in binding sites and a given drug cannot be bound to its target. Tumors also change expression isoforms of tubulin for these ones, which are not targets for antimitotic drugs e.g. overexpress \u03b2III-tubulin. In addition tumor cells express other kinds of proteins and change microtubule dynamic to counteract effect of anticancer drugs.  Drug resistance can also develop due to the interruption in therapy.",
