Kinesin-5, like all motor proteins, breaks down ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, using a water molecule, and converts the chemical energy to force and motion along microtubules. Kinetic experiments reveal rates of how fast intermediate steps in catalysis occur and the most extensive set of studies on Kinesin-5 kinetics has been on the human protein. X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and real-time infrared spectroscopy have been used to measure the structure of Kinesin-5 in the different catalytic intermediate states. Changes in the secondary structure, or conformational switching, is required to convert and amplify biochemical changes in the catalytic active site into larger movements necessary for cellular motion. For example, the first step of ATP hydrolysis, which is the attack of the terminal phosphate of ATP by a water molecule, had not been observed by x-ray crystallography in any kinesin protein, until recently in Kinesin-5. This crystal structure showed that there was not one, but rather two, water molecules and they are in close association with each other. A two-water catalytic model was proposed and confirmed by an alternate method to track Kinesin-5 catalysis in real-time and in a kinesin protein in a different subfamily. Two-water catalytic models also are proposed in a divergent motor protein, myosin, and observed experimentally in one of its crystal structures.",

However, it has been recently discovered that in budding yeast cells kinesin Cin8 (a member of the Kinesin-5 family) can move toward the negative end as well, or retrograde transport. This means, kinesin has the novel ability to switch directionality. Kinesin, so far, has only been shown to move toward the negative end when in a group, with motors sliding in the antiparallel direction in an attempt to separate microtubules. This dual directionality has been observed in identical conditions where free Cin8 molecules move towards the minus end, but cross-linking Cin8 move toward the plus ends of each cross-linked microtubule. One specific study tested the speed at which Cin8 motors moved, their results yielded a range of about 25-55nm/s, in the direction of the spindle poles. On an individual basis it has been found that through the use of ionic conditions Cin8 motors can become as fast as 380nm/s, a notable jump. This tells us that Cin 8 can easily change directions on a microtubule, and in turn led to the plus end movement of kinesin on a microtubule. It is suggested that this unique ability is a result of coupling with other Cin8 motors and helps to fulfill the role of dynein in budding yeast. This discovery in kinesin-14 family proteins (such as\u00a0\"Drosophila melanogaster\" NCD, budding yeast KAR3, and\u00a0\"Arabidopsis thaliana\"\u00a0ATK5) allows kinesin to walk in the opposite direction, toward microtubule minus end.

Another important role Microtubules play is during mitosis when the cell has undergone a duplication event and is in the process of creating daughter cells. Microtubules make up the mitotic spindle which are responsible for distributing the chromosomes to daughter nuclei during anaphase.

In the absence of microtubules (Mts), the basal ATPase activity is inhibited through slowed product release. In the presence of microtubules, the ATPase activity is also reduced with weakened binding of Eg5 to microtubules during steady-state ATP turnover. Monastrol-treated Eg5 also shows a decreased relative affinity for microtubules under equilibrium conditions. The Mt.Eg5 presteady-state kinetics of ATP binding and the subsequent ATP-dependent isomerization are unaffected during the first ATP turnover. However, monastrol appears to stabilize a conformation that allows for reversals at the ATP hydrolysis step. Monastrol promotes a dramatic decrease in the observed rate of Eg5 association with microtubules, and ADP release is slowed without trapping the Mt.Eg5.ADP intermediate. We propose that S-monastrol binding to Eg5 induces a stable conformational change in the motor domain that favors ATP re-synthesis after ATP hydrolysis.

The remainder of the actin binding site is blocked by tropomyosin. With the ATP hydrolyzed, the cocked myosin head now contains ADP + P. Two ions bind to troponin C on the actin filaments. The troponin- complex causes tropomyosin to slide over and unblock the remainder of the actin binding site.

The most striking outcomes of the analysis of Kinesin-5 motility is that it is slow \u2013 about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 \u2013 with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of mechanical force (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and optical trap assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a glass surface and microtubules are laid down over the top. Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility. By attaching microtubules to the glass surface first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can crosslink two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis \u2013 sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a glass surface, then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they \u201cwalk\u201d along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity \u2013 the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In optical trap experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. This allows for the measurement of the stall force \u2013 the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. Optical trap experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable plateau phase in which the motor \u201cstruggles\u201d at its maximal force generation before letting go. Extrapolation of kinetic data suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the optical trap by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this.",

Following the motor domain is a light-chain-binding 'neck' region containing 1-6 copies of a repeat element, the IQ motif, that serves as a binding site for calmodulin or other members of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. At the C-terminus, each myosin class has a distinct tail domain that serves in dimerization, membrane binding, protein binding, and/or enzymatic activities and targets each myosin to its particular subcellular location. The myosin-1a protein is expressed by enterocytes, the epithelial cells that line the luminal surface of the small intestine. In these cells the myosin-1a protein localizes specifically to the brush border. Experiments indicate that the brush border population of the encoded protein turns over rapidly, while its head and tail domains interact transiently with the core actin and plasma membrane, respectively.

Ca binds to a protein called troponin, which is bound to the actin filament. This binding causes a shape change in the troponin which exposes areas on the actin, to which the head of the myosin filament binds. The binding of the myosin head to actin is known as a cross-bridge. A molecule, called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is produced by an intracellular structure called a mitochondrion, is then used, as a source of energy, to help move the myosin head, carrying the actin. As a result, the actin slides across the myosin filament shortening the muscle. This is called a power stroke. Myosin then detaches from the actin and resets itself back to its original position, binding to another part of the actin and producing another power stroke, shortening the muscle further. This process continues, with the myosin head moving in a motion similar to that of an oar rowing a boat, until the Ca level within the cell decreases (see figure 1).",

In the absence of microtubules (Mts), the basal ATPase activity is inhibited through slowed product release. In the presence of microtubules, the ATPase activity is also reduced with weakened binding of Eg5 to microtubules during steady-state ATP turnover. Monastrol-treated Eg5 also shows a decreased relative affinity for microtubules under equilibrium conditions. The Mt.Eg5 presteady-state kinetics of ATP binding and the subsequent ATP-dependent isomerization are unaffected during the first ATP turnover.

Monastrol promotes a dramatic decrease in the observed rate of Eg5 association with microtubules, and ADP release is slowed without trapping the Mt.Eg5.ADP intermediate.

The most striking outcomes of the analysis of Kinesin-5 motility is that it is slow \u2013 about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 \u2013 with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of mechanical force (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and optical trap assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a glass surface and microtubules are laid down over the top. Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility. By attaching microtubules to the glass surface first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can crosslink two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis \u2013 sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a glass surface, then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they \u201cwalk\u201d along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity \u2013 the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In optical trap experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. This allows for the measurement of the stall force \u2013 the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. Optical trap experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable plateau phase in which the motor \u201cstruggles\u201d at its maximal force generation before letting go. Extrapolation of kinetic data suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the optical trap by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this.",

However, it has been recently discovered that in budding yeast cells kinesin Cin8 (a member of the Kinesin-5 family) can move toward the negative end as well, or retrograde transport. This means, kinesin has the novel ability to switch directionality. Kinesin, so far, has only been shown to move toward the negative end when in a group, with motors sliding in the antiparallel direction in an attempt to separate microtubules. This dual directionality has been observed in identical conditions where free Cin8 molecules move towards the minus end, but cross-linking Cin8 move toward the plus ends of each cross-linked microtubule. One specific study tested the speed at which Cin8 motors moved, their results yielded a range of about 25-55nm/s, in the direction of the spindle poles. On an individual basis it has been found that through the use of ionic conditions Cin8 motors can become as fast as 380nm/s, a notable jump. This tells us that Cin 8 can easily change directions on a microtubule, and in turn led to the plus end movement of kinesin on a microtubule. It is suggested that this unique ability is a result of coupling with other Cin8 motors and helps to fulfill the role of dynein in budding yeast.

This is not a stable interaction because the convex surface of the catalytic core does not fit to the flat surface of the straight microtubule protofilament. Steric hindrance between the molecule neck and adjacent protofilament further inhibits full contact between protein and the microtubule and only facilitates one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule. At this time, The protein's nucleotide binding pocket is trapped in an open state so that the structure is not hydrolyzing ATP. Once the motor reaches the end of the microtubule, the protofilament spontaneously curves itself allowing motor to make full contact with the tubulin subunit. More MCAK molecules collectively bind to the curved region supporting the theory that they do not actively peel away the microtubule but they wait patiently for it to adopt this curved conformation. They stabilize the curved conformation by binding to the end of the microtubule and then catalyze depolymerization.",

The antiparallel tetrameric organization of the Kinesin-5 family is fundamentally different from the majority of other kinesins that are dimers, such as the well-characterized conventional Kinesin-1 (KIF5B). Conventional kinesin dimerizes in such a manner that the catalytic (head) domains are together on one end of the complex to facilitate hand-over-hand movement along a microtubule that enables long-range, directed transport of cellular cargoes. The unique assembly of Kinesin-5 proteins not only organizes the protein complex for a different cellular function (antiparallel microtubule sliding, described above) but also made it difficult to study the mechanical properties of the motor using the classical experiments that were designed for dimeric kinesins. These obstacles have been overcome by either adapting the original experiments to analyze the tetrameric organization of Kinesin-5, or by working with shorter Kinesin-5 proteins that form dimers like conventional kinesin.",

Small-molecule inhibitors are not only important tools for understanding nanomotors in cells; they are also have potential for serving as tools in the clinic. Induced by human Kinesin-5 inhibitors, mitotic arrest results in apoptosis in some tumor cell lines and human tumor xenograft models. With these promising preclinical studies, ispinesib (SB-715992; Cytokinetics/GSK), SB-743921 from Cytokinetics/GSK, MK-0731 from Merck, filanesib (ARRY-520) (Array BioPharma), and litronesib (LY2523355) (Eli Lilly) have entered into clinical trials. Although second-generation Kinesin-5 inhibitors have had better success, none have been fully developed and marketed as an anti-cancer treatment. The role of specific residues in the L5 pocket (L5, \u03b12, and \u03b13) in human Kinesin-5 has been tested, but not yet been systematically explored. The initial goal of these mutation experiments was to determine which residues had greatest pharmacological importance in drug development. For example, mutations in the KIF11 gene convey resistance of mitotic cell lines to inhibitors such as monastrol and STLC. For example, point mutations in the inhibitor binding pocket, R119A, D130A, L132A, I136A, L214A and E215A confer resistance to monastrol, while R119A, D130A and L214A mutations confer resistance to STLC. In contrast to the loss-of-function experiments, a gain-of-function experiment using Drosophila Kinesin-5 showed that all L5-directed inhibitors do not allosterically communicate in the same way within the Kinesin-5 motor domain.  A second purpose of mutational studies is to understand how drug resistance in cells is conferred from only changing one residue. These changes in the inhibitor-binding pocket are correlated with structural modification, or twist, of the central beta-sheet of the Kinesin-5 motor domain. In this manner, the L5 loop may be able to directly control nucleotide binding and beta-sheet twist can manipulate the adjacent microtubule-binding site. This may explain how tumor cells rapidly can become drug-resistant to KIF11 inhibitors.",

The Kinesin-13 family's molecular mechanism is less understood than other classes of kinesins which have their motor domains at one end of the molecule or the other. They are capable of traveling to both the minus and plus ends of microtubules whereas most motors are unidirectional. Thus they can catalytically depolymerize a microtubule from both ends making it a very efficient process.",

These proteins harness the energy of ATP hydrolysis to induce destabilizing conformational changes in protofilament structure that cause kinesin release and microtubule depolymerization.

Once Kinesin-5 is phosphorylated at this residue in early prophase, it localizes to the mitotic spindle where it binds to microtubules. An additional phosphosite was identified on the Kinesin-5 tail in 2008, however, only approximately 3% of the total microtubule-associated Kinesin-5 is phosphorylated at this residues. While additional phosphosites or other post-translational modifications within the Kinesin-5 tail, stalk, and motor have been identified, no other modifications have been proven as necessary for Kinesin-5 to perform its necessary tasks in mitosis. Kinesin-5 is also regulated through direct interaction with other proteins. The microtubule-associated protein, TPX2, associates with Kinesin-5 in mitosis. Their interaction is necessary for Kinesin-5 localization to the mitotic spindle, for stabilizing the spindle, and for spindle pole segregation.
