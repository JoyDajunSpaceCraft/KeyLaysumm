TREM2 interacts with DAP12 in microglia to trigger phagocytosis of amyloid beta peptide and apoptotic neurons without inflammation. Mutations in TREM2 impair the normal proteolytic maturation of the protein which in turn interferes with phagocytosis and may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",

While different gene mutations occur within the pathway for Nasu-Hakola and HDLS, both are characterized by white matter degeneration with axonal spheroids. Current researchers in the field believe that more in depth analysis and comparison of the two genetic abnormalities in these disorders could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms in these rare disorders. POLD exhibits noninflammatory demyelination of axons with initial symptoms of euphoria, apathy, headache, and executive dysfunction. While HDLS is autosomal dominant, some families with POLD have features that suggest autosomal recessive inheritance. Nevertheless, POLD has recently been shown to have the same genetic basis as HDLS. The cause of HDLS in most families is mutation in the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), a growth factor for microglia and monocyte/macrophages, suggesting that microglial dysfunction may be primary in HDLS.",

However, because the only difference between the family members who developed Alzheimer's Disease and those that did not in these families was the inheritance of the mutation in the amyloid gene this suggested that the amyloid protein itself could cause the disease. The idea that amyloid could cause the disease influenced scientific research until this day. Many experimental treatments are directed towards lowering amyloid levels in the brain. The other main effect the discovery of the Swedish mutation had was to provide one transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease.

The clinical features associated with inactivating \"GATA1\" mutations or other causes of reduced GATA1 levels vary greatly with respect not only to the types of disease exhibited but also to disease severity. This variation depends on at least four factors. First, inactivating mutations in \"GATA1\" cause X-linked recessive diseases. Males, with only one \"GATA1\" gene, experience the diseases of these mutations while women, with two GATA1 genes, experience no or extremely mild evidence of these diseases unless they have inactivating mutations in both genes or their mutation is dominant negative, i.e. inhibiting the good gene's function. Second, the extent to which a mutation reduces the cellular levels of fully functional GATA1 correlates with disease severity. Third, inactivating \"GATA1\" mutations can cause different disease manifestations. For example, mutations in GATA1's N-ZnF that interfere with its interaction with FOG1 result in reduced red blood cell and platelet levels whereas mutations in N-ZnF that reduce its binding affinity to target genes cause a reduction in red blood cells plus thalassemia-type and porphyria-type symptoms. Fourth, the genetic background of individuals can impact the type and severity of symptoms. For example, \"GATA1\"-inactivating mutations in individuals with the extra chromosome 21 of Down syndrome exhibit a proliferation of megakaryoblasts that infiltrate and consequentially directly damage liver, heart, marrow, pancreas, and skin plus secondarily life-threatening damage to the lungs and kidneys. These same individuals can develop secondary mutations in other genes that results in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.",

These CRISPR-modified pluripotent stem cells were subsequently grown into human kidney organoids, which exhibited disease-specific phenotypes. Kidney organoids from stem cells with polycystic kidney disease mutations formed large, translucent cyst structures from kidney tubules. When cultured in the absence of adherent cues (in suspension), these cysts reached sizes of 1\u00a0cm in diameter over several months.

KSS is the result of deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that cause a particular constellation of medical signs and symptoms. mtDNA is transmitted exclusively from the mother's ovum. Mitochondrial DNA is composed of 37 genes found in the single circular chromosome measuring 16,569 base pairs in length. Among these, 13 genes encode proteins of the electron transport chain (abbreviated \"ETC\"), 22 encode transfer RNA (tRNA), and two encode the large and small subunits that form ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The 13 proteins involved in the ETC of the mitochondrion are necessary for oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in these proteins results in impaired energy production by mitochondria. This cellular energy deficit manifests most readily in tissues that rely heavily upon aerobic metabolism such as the brain, skeletal and cardiac muscles, sensory organs, and kidneys. This is one factor involved in the presentation of mitochondrial diseases.  There are other factors involved in the manifestation of a mitochondrial disease besides the size and location of a mutation. Mitochondria replicate during each cell division during gestation and throughout life. Because the mutation in mitochondrial disease most often occurs early in gestation in these diseases, only those mitochondria in the mutated lineage are defective. This results in an uneven distribution of dysfunctional mitochondria within each cell, and among different tissues of the body. This describes the term heteroplasmic which is characteristic of mitochondrial diseases including KSS. The distribution of mutated mtDNA in each cell, tissue, and organ, is dependent on when and where the mutation occurs. This may explain why two patients with an identical mutation in mtDNA can present with entirely different phenotypes and in turn different syndromes. A publication in 1992 by Fischel-Ghodsian et al. identified the same 4,977-bp deletion in mtDNA in two patients presenting with two entirely different diseases. One of the patients had characteristic KSS, while the other patient had a very different disease known as Pearson marrow pancreas syndrome. Complicating the matter, in some cases Pearson's syndrome has been shown to progress into KSS later in life. More recent studies have concluded that mtDNA duplications may also play a significant role in determining what phenotype is present. Duplications of mtDNA seem to be characteristic of all cases of KSS and Pearson's syndrome, while they are absent in CPEO.  Deletions of mtDNA in KSS vary in size (1.3\u20138kb), as well as position in the mitochondrial genome. The most common deletion is 4.9kb and spans from position 8469 to position 13147 on the genome.

Without efficient autophagy, neurons gather ubiquitinated protein aggregates and degrade. Ubiquitinated proteins are proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin to get degraded. Mutations of synuclien alleles lead to lysosome pH increase and hydrolase inhibition. As a result, lysosomes degradative capacity is decreased.

His conception and co-development of Cre-Lox conditional mutagenesis continues to provide major discoveries of the mechanistic underpinnings of health and disease among hundreds of researchers and their laboratories. Prior to the development of conditional mutagenesis, the use of homologous recombination was limited to systemic gene targeting and mutation. Marth's use of Cre-Lox conditional mutagenesis established the presence and functions of multiple and in some cases previously unknown enzymes participating in protein glycosylation, an area of research that has become a focus of exploration in how common diseases originate in the absence of discernible pathogenic genetic variation. Marth has further used Cre-Lox conditional mutagenesis to establish a reproducible method for obtaining animal models of essential X chromosome-linked genes. These studies further explained how glycan linkages function in the origins of disease at the metabolic and cellular levels. Marth's early studies of glycosylation and glycan linkages revealed a profound effect on immunity and contributed substantially to the genesis of the related field of glycoimmunology. Marth's lab further discovered relationships between aberrant glycan linkages and autoimmune diseases including the fact that alterations of glycan linkages could initiate chronic inflammation in the development of autoimmunity. Marth's research has shown that the occurrence of autoimmune conditions (such as lupus) in mammals can be caused by the presence of abnormal glycan structures within the body. Marth's laboratory has also taken a close look at the molecular and cellular bases of type 2 diabetes and the role that protein glycosylation has in the origin of the disease. Their research showed that the malfunction of pancreatic beta cells was the major contributor to disease onset. Their research indicated that genetic variation was unlikely to be the cause of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes in humans. Instead, their models suggested that metabolic alterations of pancreatic beta cells due to an elevation of fatty acids in obesity disabled glucose sensing, resulting in hyperglycemia with glucose intolerance. Marth\u2019s laboratory further found that this pathway was induced in human patients with type 2 diabetes and was responsible for a significant amount of insulin resistance present in obesity-associated diabetes. The pathological features of sepsis have also been the subject of research by Marth's laboratory. Marth and colleagues discovered the first physiological purpose of the Ashwell-Morell Receptor (AMR), a hepatocyte lectin discovered by Gilbert Ashwell and Anatol Morell. Their studies revealed both a biological purpose of the receptor and how to use it for therapeutic purposes in pneumococcal sepsis. In 2008, Dr. Marth published an enumeration of the building blocks of life, all of which fall under the 4 types of macromolecules present in all cells (glycans, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins). This concept is becoming a feature of modern cell biology texts. Marth and other colleagues have called attention to the fact that only half of these macromolecules are encoded in the genome, thus indicating that a more holistic and rigorous approach is needed to understanding cell biology and the origins of disease. In his position as the Director of the Center of Nanomedicine, Marth and his team are exploring the application of new delivery methods to directly visualize and treat disease in collaboration with Center for Nanomedicine Co-Founder, Dr. Erkki Ruoslahti.",

However, because the only difference between the family members who developed Alzheimer's Disease and those that did not in these families was the inheritance of the mutation in the amyloid gene this suggested that the amyloid protein itself could cause the disease. The idea that amyloid could cause the disease influenced scientific research until this day. Many experimental treatments are directed towards lowering amyloid levels in the brain. The other main effect the discovery of the Swedish mutation had was to provide one transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease.

Deregulation of the autophagy pathway and mutation of alleles regulating autophagy are believed to cause neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is essential for neuronal survival. Without efficient autophagy, neurons gather ubiquitinated protein aggregates and degrade. Ubiquitinated proteins are proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin to get degraded. Mutations of synuclien alleles lead to lysosome pH increase and hydrolase inhibition. As a result, lysosomes degradative capacity is decreased. There are several genetic mutations implicated in the disease, including loss of function PINK1 and Parkin. Loss of function in these genes can lead to damaged mitochondrial accumulation and protein aggregates than can lead to cellular degeneration. Mitochondria is involved in Parkinson's disease.

Research has found evidence that microtubule assembly and stability in the cytoskeleton is compromised causing the neurons to degrade over time. Alzheimer's disease is much like Parkinson's in that it is also a neurodegenerative disease that affects the cytoskeleton. Tau proteins, which stabilize microtubules, malfunction in patient's affected by Alzheimers, causing pathology with the cytoskeleton. Huntington's disease has also been found to affect the cytoskeleton of cells by excess glutamine in the Huntington protein, which is involved with linking vesicles to the cytoskeleton.

When refolding is not an option, the cell can also target the protein for degradation back into its component amino acids via proteolytic, lysosomal, or autophagic mechanisms. However, under certain conditions or with certain mutations, the cells can no longer cope with the misfolded protein(s) and a disease state results. Either the protein has a loss-of-function, such as in cystic fibrosis, in which it loses activity or cannot reach its target, or the protein has a gain-of-function, such as with Alzheimer's disease, in which the protein begins to aggregate causing it to become insoluble and non-functional.",

This form of Kufs is autosomal dominant, meaning that only one copy of each mutated gene is enough for the disease to manifest. When there is a mutation in the DNAJC5 gene, it affects the production of a cysteine string protein (CSP) that is coded within DNAJC5. CSP aids in transmitting signals through the nerves found in the brain. When the CTSF gene is mutated, it cannot produce Cathepsin F - an enzyme that cuts proteins in the lysozyme. By cutting proteins, Cathepsin F can modify the function of the proteins as well as help break them down. Similar to Type A, when both DNAJC5 and CTSF are non-functional, it results in the incomplete breakdown of proteins.

Alzheimer's Disease is the most common cause of severe memory impairment and is caused by senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neuritis, and neuronal loss. It is thought that Alzheimer's disease may be due to unnecessary protein accumulation of \u03b2 Amyloid. In fact, Senile plaques are dense, protein deposits composed of amyloid \u03b2 peptide. The two types of senile plaques are diffuse plaques and neuritic plaques, and differ in morphology. In addition to the amyloid, the microtubule-associated Tau protein has also been in involved with Alzheimer's Disease and a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases. Inherited forms of Alzheimer's have been linked to mutation in the APP genes or presenilins which regulate APP processing. Because cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis are significantly altered during Alzheimer's progression, cholinergic agents such as choline and lecithin were hypothesized to augment the progression. However, these attempts were unsuccessful and the only clinically useful drugs used in the United States are cholinesterase inhibitors, which prolong the time before choline degradation. Although aNMDA receptor antagonists and anti-inflammatory drugs were tested in a clinical environment, more promising clinical trials are underway to targeting the A\u03b2 with the immune system.",

MEN1 mutations comprise mostly frameshift deletions or insertions, followed by nonsense, missense, splice-site mutations and either part or complete gene deletions resulting in disease pathology. Frameshift and nonsense mutations result in a supposed inactive and truncated menin protein while splice-site mutations result in incorrectly spliced mRNA. Missense mutations of MEN1 are especially important as they result in a change to crucial amino acids needed in order to bind and interact with other proteins and molecules. As menin is located predominantly in the nucleus, these mutations can impact the stability of the cell and may further affect functional activity or expression levels of the protein. Studies have also shown that single amino acid changes in genes involved in oncogenic disorders may result in proteolytic degradation leading to loss of function and reduced stability of the mutant protein; a common mechanism for inactivating tumor suppressor gene products. MEN1 gene mutations and deletions also play a role in the development of hereditary and a subgroup of sporadic pituitary adenomas and were detected in approximately 5% of sporadic pituitary adenomas. Consequently, alterations of the gene represent a candidate pathogenetic mechanism of pituitary tumorigenesis especially when considered in terms of interactions with other proteins, growth factors, oncogenes play a rule in tumorigenesis.",

Since the Ca hypothesis of Alzheimer's was proposed in 1994, several studies have shown that disruptions in Ca signaling are the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease. Familial Alzheimer's disease has been strongly linked to mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. All of the mutated forms of these genes observed to date have been found to cause abnormal Ca signaling in the ER. The functions of PS1 are not yet known, but mutations in PS1 have been shown to increase IP-mediated Ca release from the ER in several animal models. Calcium channel blockers have been used to treat Alzheimer's disease with some success, and the use of lithium to decrease IP turnover has also been suggested as a possible method of treatment.",

When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's \"HTT\" alleles causes the disease.

Eventually the buildup of lipopigments results in death of the neuron cells, giving way to the phenotypic symptoms.
