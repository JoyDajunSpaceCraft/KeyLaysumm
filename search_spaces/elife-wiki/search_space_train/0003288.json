For example, a yeast mutant with an inactivated uracil synthesis pathway gene is a uracil auxotroph (e.g., if the yeast Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase gene is inactivated, the resultant strain is a uracil auxotroph). Such a strain is unable to synthesize uracil and will only be able to grow if uracil can be taken up from the environment. This is the opposite of a uracil prototroph, or in this case a wild-type strain, which can still grow in the absence of uracil. Auxotrophic genetic markers are often used in molecular genetics; they were famously used in Beadle and Tatum's Nobel prize-winning work on the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis, connecting mutations of genes to protein mutations. This then allows for biosynthetic or biochemical pathway mapping that can help determine which enzyme or enzymes are mutated and dysfunctional in the auxotrophic strains of bacteria being studied.",

The strains have been altered with a mutation in a gene important for histidine production, so they require histidine for growth. The cells are grown on a histidine rich medium and are then transferred to a medium that lacks histidine and contains the potential mutagenic substance. If the mutagenic substance causes mutations, there is a very small chance that another mutation occurs in the histidine gene which again enables the production of histidine. These cells are then able to grow on the medium lacking histidine. The mutagenicity of a compound is calculated by the number of yeast colonies which are reverted to the histidine-independent form. In one study, the Ames test was executed with benzo[\"c\"]fluorene. Two different strains were used, TA100 and TA98. One group of each strain had a rat liver fraction and one group did not. The difference between the TA100 and the TA98 strain is that the TA98 strain has a frameshift mutation, and the TA100 has a base substitution mutation. When the amount of benzo[\"c\"]fluorene is increased in TA 100 yeast strain, the amount of revertants per plate does not increase. Only in the TA98 strain plate, which contained a fraction of a rat liver, a higher dose of benzo[\"c\"]fluorene seems to correspond with a larger amount of revertants. This indicates that benzo[\"c\"]fluorene is metabolized by enzymes in the rat liver into more potent mutagenic compounds. These compounds only affected the TA98 strain. This indicates that the adducts formed by benzo[\"c\"]fluorene metabolites cause frameshift mutations, and not point mutations.",

The MNR2 gene encodes a protein closely related to the Alr proteins, but includes conserved features that define a distinct subgroup of CorA proteins in fungal genomes, suggesting a distinct role in Mg homeostasis. Like an alr1 mutant, growth of an mnr2 mutant was sensitive to Mg-deficient conditions, but the mnr2 mutant was observed to accumulate more Mg than a wild-type strain under these conditions. These phenotypes suggested that Mnr2 may regulate Mg storage within an intracellular compartment. Consistent with this interpretation, the Mnr2 protein was localized to the membrane of the vacuole, an internal compartment implicated in the storage of excess mineral nutrients by yeast. A direct role of Mnr2 in Mg transport was suggested by the observation that increased Mnr2 expression, which redirected some Mnr2 protein to the cell surface, also suppressed the Mg-requirement of an alr1 alr2 double mutant strain. Interestingly, the mnr2 mutation also altered accumulation of other divalent cations, suggesting this mutation may increase Alr gene expression or protein activity. Recent work supported this model, by showing that Alr1 activity was increased in an mnr2 mutant strain, and that the mutation was associated with induction of Alr1 activity at a higher external Mg concentration than was observed for an Mnr2 wild-type strain. These effects were observed without any change in Alr1 protein accumulation, again indicating that Alr1 activity may be regulated directly by the Mg concentration within the cell.",

In this case, each strain's genome supplies the wild-type allele to \"complement\" the mutated allele of the other strain's genome.

These mutations may be frameshift, missense, non-sense, or mutations of other kinds and are likely to cause deletions in the gene product. Apart from helicase activity that is common to all RecQ helices, it also acts to prevent inappropriate homologous recombination. During replication of the genome, the two copies of DNA, called sister chromatids, are held together through a structure called the centromere. During this time, the homologous (corresponding) copies are in close physical proximity to each other, allowing them to 'cross' and exchange genetic information, a process called homologous recombination. Defective homologous recombination can cause mutation and genetic instability. Such defective recombination can introduce gaps and breaks within the genome and disrupt the function of genes, possibly causing growth retardation, aging and elevated risk of cancer. It introduces gaps and breaks within the genome and disrupts the function of genes, often causing retardation of growth, aging and elevated risks of cancers. The Bloom syndrome protein interacts with other proteins, such as topoisomerase III\u03b1 and RMI2, and suppresses illegitimate recombination events between sequences that are divergent from strict homology, thus maintaining genome stability. Individuals with BS have a loss-of-function mutation, which means that the illegitimate recombination is no longer suppressed, leading to higher rates of mutation (~10-100 times above normal, depending on cell type).",

Initial genetic research excluded a role for the melanocortin 1 receptor and the \"Agouti\" locus as being the cause of the black dilution trait in dogs. Instead, TYRP1 (tyrosine related protein 1) was found to be responsible. This enzyme is localised to melanosomes, the cellular organelles that produce and store pigments, and serves to catalyze oxidation of eumelanin precursors. In dogs, three mutations in this gene have been identified, one resulting in a truncation of the protein, the other two leading to an amino acid deletion or a single amino acid substitution in the sequence of the protein. All of these mutations are found across the range of dogs, and hence are thought to have preceded the divergence of distinct breeds, and all three are found within Labrador Retrievers. Each of the mutations appears to eliminate or significantly reduce enzymatic activity, and the colouration phenotypes (the visible traits) produced by the three mutations are indistinguishable. These represent recessive mutations in the TYRP1 gene, and since mammals have two copies of each gene, one from each parent, an animal with at least one copy of the fully functioning TYRP1 protein (represented as 'B') will display the dominant trait, black pigmentation, while to display brown pigmentation, both copies of this gene must be mutant alleles (collectively represented as 'b').

This catalyzed Benzer's shift in interest to biology, and he moved into the area of bacteriophage genetics., spending two years as a postdoctoral fellow in Max Delbr\u00fcck's laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and then returning to Purdue. At Purdue University, Benzer developed the T4 \"rII\" system, a new genetic technique involving recombination in T4 bacteriophage \"rII\" mutants. After observing that a particular \"rII\" mutant, a mutation that caused the bacteriophage to eliminate bacteria more rapidly than usual, was not exhibiting the expected phenotype, it occurred to Benzer that this strain might have come from a cross between two different \"rII\" mutants (each having part of the \"rII\" gene intact) wherein a recombination event resulted in a normal \"rII\" sequence. Benzer realized that by generating many \"r\" mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different \"r\" strains, one could create a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes. Taking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the \"rII\" mutant system, Benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 \"rII\" mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear. Benzer also proved that mutations were distributed in many different parts of a single gene, and the resolving power of his system allowed him to discern mutants that differ at the level of a single nucleotide. Based on his \"rII\" data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.",

Similarly, with meats that are dried, there is salt added to help preserve it but results in the consumer having a higher sodium intake.

            "document": "Tequila . Tequila is a distilled beverage that is made from the fermentation of the sugars found from the blue agave plant once it has been cooked, the main sugar being fructose. Through the fermentation process, many factors influence the higher alcohol content of tequila, which are molecules such as isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol, and ethanol. These parameters include the type of yeast strain, the age of the agave plant itself, temperature, and the carbon/nitrogen ratio. However, the type of yeast strain used and the carbon/nitrogen factors have the biggest influence on the production of higher alcohols, this is not surprising as higher alcohol and ethanol production is an intrinsic property of the metabolism of each strain. The type of yeast most commonly found in tequila is \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", which contains many strains. For example, CF1 agaves, a type of yeast, produces much more ethanol than a strain of CF2, as the yeast's metabolism mechanisms differ from one another. This factor may be influenced from different agricultural practices that occur to cultivate the different yeasts strains. It was found that the higher the carbon/ nitrogen ratio, the higher the production of higher alcohols such as isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol. A high ratio imparts that there is less nitrogen in the fermentation process, which results in deamination reactions of amino acids, leading to the synthesis of higher alcohols. The Ehrlich pathway is the name for this process, where a-ceto acids are decarboxylated and transformed to aldehydes and to higher alcohols. The temperature of the fermentation process also greatly effects the alcohol content of the resulting product. For example, a study conducted by Pinal \"et al.\" found that cultivating two strains at a temperature of 35 degrees as compared to a temperature of 30 degrees produced more isoamyl alcohol. The higher temperature suggests that this is a much more optimal condition for the yeast to ferment the distilled beverage. Lastly the age of the agave plant itself, the older the plant the greater the alcohol production. It was shown in a study that the concentration of amyl alcohol increased as the plant aged by a factor 30%. However, it is also found that there is a higher concentration of methanol found when using younger plants. This may be due to differences in agricultural practices that occur when taking care of plants of different ages.",

            "document": "Stuck fermentation . A chronic problem in winemaking is \"stuck fermentation,\" when yeast that should be busily converting grape sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide prematurely shuts down, leaving the remaining sugar to instead be consumed by bacteria that can spoil the wine. A team of researchers including UC Davis yeast geneticist Linda Bisson has discovered a biochemical communication system behind this problem. Working through a prion -- an abnormally shaped protein that can reproduce itself -- the system enables bacteria in fermenting wine to switch yeast from sugar to other food sources without altering the yeast's DNA. \"The discovery of this process really gives us a clue to how stuck fermentations can be avoided,\" said Bisson, a professor in the Department of Viticulture and Enology. \"Our goal now is to find yeast strains that essentially ignore the signal initiated by the bacteria and do not form the prion, but instead power on through the fermentation.\" She suggests that the discovery of this biochemical mechanism, reported Aug. 28 in the journal Cell, may also have implications for better understanding metabolic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, in humans. Bacteria, yeast and fermentation Biologists have known for years that an ancient biological circuit, based in the membranes of yeast cells, blocks yeast from using other carbon sources when the sugar glucose is present. This circuit, known as \"glucose repression,\" is especially strong in the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enabling people to use that yeast for practical fermentation processes in winemaking, brewing and bread making, because it causes such efficient processing of sugar. Prions play key role In this study, the researchers found that the glucose repression circuit is sometimes interrupted when bacteria jump-start the replication of the prions in membranes of yeast cells. The interference of the prions causes the yeast to process carbon sources other than glucose and become less effective in metabolizing sugar, dramatically slowing down the fermentation until it, in effect, becomes \"stuck.\" \"This type of prion-based inheritance is useful to organisms when they need to adapt to environmental conditions but not necessarily permanently,\" Bisson said. \"In this case, the heritable changes triggered by the prions enable the yeast to also change back to their initial mode of operation if environmental conditions should change again.\" The researchers demonstrated in this study that the process leading to a stuck fermentation benefits both the bacteria and the yeast. As sugar metabolism slows down, conditions in the fermenting wine become more conducive to bacterial growth, and the yeast benefit by gaining the ability to metabolize not only glucose but also other carbon sources as well -- maintaining and extending their lifespan. Solutions for winemakers Now that this communication mechanism between the bacteria and yeast is more clearly understood, winemakers should be better able to avoid stuck fermentations. \"Winemakers may want to alter the levels of sulfur dioxide used when pressing or crushing the grapes, in order to knock out bacteria that can trigger the processes that we now know can lead to a stuck fermentation,\" Bisson said. \"They also can be careful about blending grapes from vineyards known to have certain bacterial strains or they could add yeast strains that have the ability to overpower these vineyard bacteria.\"",

The MNR2 gene encodes a protein closely related to the Alr proteins, but includes conserved features that define a distinct subgroup of CorA proteins in fungal genomes, suggesting a distinct role in Mg homeostasis. Like an alr1 mutant, growth of an mnr2 mutant was sensitive to Mg-deficient conditions, but the mnr2 mutant was observed to accumulate more Mg than a wild-type strain under these conditions. These phenotypes suggested that Mnr2 may regulate Mg storage within an intracellular compartment. Consistent with this interpretation, the Mnr2 protein was localized to the membrane of the vacuole, an internal compartment implicated in the storage of excess mineral nutrients by yeast. A direct role of Mnr2 in Mg transport was suggested by the observation that increased Mnr2 expression, which redirected some Mnr2 protein to the cell surface, also suppressed the Mg-requirement of an alr1 alr2 double mutant strain. Interestingly, the mnr2 mutation also altered accumulation of other divalent cations, suggesting this mutation may increase Alr gene expression or protein activity. Recent work supported this model, by showing that Alr1 activity was increased in an mnr2 mutant strain, and that the mutation was associated with induction of Alr1 activity at a higher external Mg concentration than was observed for an Mnr2 wild-type strain. These effects were observed without any change in Alr1 protein accumulation, again indicating that Alr1 activity may be regulated directly by the Mg concentration within the cell.",

The strain came from a 19 year old patient with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis at the Trudeau Sanatorium in Saranac Lake, New York. It was maintained for many years by serial passage of cultures at the Trudeau Sanatorium and initially named strain H37. Over time it was found to have variable virulence in animal models based on which medium it was grown on. Strains with different virulence were then intentionally produced, with H37R being less virulent after growing in acidic media and H37S was more virulent in guinea pigs after being grown in alkaline media (with R standing for resistant to environment, and S for sensitive to environment). The more virulent strain was later renamed H37Rv, with R standing for rough morphology and v standing for virulent. The strain was used for many laboratory studies and became the standard for tuberculosis. It was later designated as the neotype for the species. Koch first discovered mycobacterium tuberculosis as the cause of tuberculosis in 1892 but the strains he studied were not preserved and it is unclear how related H37Rv may be to those strains. H37Rv has continued to be the strain of tuberculosis most used in laboratories, and was the first to have its complete genome published in 1998. It is unclear how much H37Rv may have evolved in more than 100 years under artificial conditions in laboratories from strains in the wild, but its genome is similar to a strain isolated from a 19th century grave in Yorkshire. However it does not have some characteristics, such as causing caseous necrosis in rabbits, that are seen in modern clinical isolates. Strains in different labs that derive from H37Rv have also been shown to have evolved differences over time, with one survey of 6 strains finding from 5 to 10 polymorphisms per strain. These included independent insertions and deletions of IS6110 transposable elements which would change the strain's spoligotype. The authors of the study cautioned against considering all strains labeled as H37Rv as a reference since there may be significant differences based on the laboratory in which it is maintained.",

The lack of adult mice limits studies to embryonic development and often makes it more difficult to determine a gene's function in relation to human health. In some instances, the gene may serve a different function in adults than in developing embryos. Knocking out a gene also may fail to produce an observable change in a mouse or may even produce different characteristics from those observed in humans in which the same gene is inactivated. For example, mutations in the p53 gene are associated with more than half of human cancers and often lead to tumours in a particular set of tissues. However, when the p53 gene is knocked out in mice, the animals develop tumours in a different array of tissues. There is variability in the whole procedure depending largely on the strain from which the stem cells have been derived. Generally cells derived from strain 129 are used. This specific strain is not suitable for many experiments (e.g., behavioural), so it is very common to backcross the offspring to other strains.

[6] For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. An instance where bacterial circadian rhythms are theorized to provide an advantage is in the microbiome. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes associated with daily LD and temperature cycles through an alteration of their environment. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others, allowing them to anticipate resources coming from the host in order to metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that exist which have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks and which communicate with biological clocks of the host. If there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms of the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. For example, if bacteria within the microbiome release cytokine-like factors in a rhythmic fashion, the host\u2019s clock might be affected. On the other hand, it is implicated that changes to the host\u2019s biological clock may alter the gut microbiome. More specifically, jet-lag induced disruption of the biological clock influences the daily pattern of phyla change. Also, specific diets (such as time-restricted feeding and transitions between regular and high fat diet) change both the host\u2019s circadian clock as well as the composition of the gut microbiome. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).",

This article suggested that although the \"use of people with a problem to help other people who have the same problem in [a] more severe form\" is \"an age-old therapeutic approach,\" the traditional focus on outcomes for those receiving help to the exclusion of considering outcomes for those providing help is too narrow; instead, Riessman advocated for increased consideration of the experience of \"the individual that needs the help less, that is, the person who is providing the assistance\" because \"frequently it is he who improves!\" (p.\u00a027). Although Riessman expressed doubt that individuals receiving help always benefit from the assistance provided to them, he felt more sure that individuals providing help are likely experiencing important gains; thus, according to Riessman, the helping interaction at least has the potential to be mutually beneficial for both parties involved (i.e., for both the individual giving and for the individual receiving aid), but it is not absolutely necessary for the \"helpee\" to benefit in order for the \"helper\" to enjoy the benefits of helping. In instances where true mutual benefit occurs, the helper and helpee benefit in different ways, such that the person receiving help benefits by way of receiving whatever specific form of assistance is offered to them (e.g., emotional support, information, etc.) while the person providing help benefits by the very act of providing help, regardless of the type of aid they provide.",

Lysine has also been implicated to play a key role in other biological processes including; structural proteins of connective tissues, calcium homeostasis, and fatty acid metabolism. Lysine has been shown to be involved in the crosslinking between the three helical polypeptides in collagen, resulting in its stability and tensile strength. This mechanism is akin to the role of lysine in bacterial cell walls, in which lysine (and \"meso\"-diaminopimelate) are critical to the formation of crosslinks, and therefore, stability of the cell wall. This concept has previously been explored as a means to circumvent the unwanted release of potentially pathogenic genetically modified bacteria. It was proposed that an auxotrophic strain of \"Escherichia coli\" (1776) could be used for all genetic modification practices, as the strain is unable to survive without the supplementation of DAP, and thus, cannot live outside of a laboratory environment. Lysine has also been proposed to be involved in calcium intestinal absorption and renal retention, and thus, may play a role in calcium homeostasis. Finally, lysine has been shown to be a precursor for carnitine, which transports fatty acids to the mitochondria, where they can be oxidised for the release of energy. Carnitine is synthesised from trimethyllysine, which is a product of the degradation of certain proteins, as such lysine must first be incorporated into proteins and be methylated prior to being converted to carnitine. It must be noted however, that in mammals the primary source of carnitine is through dietary sources, rather than through lysine conversion.",

The strains have been altered with a mutation in a gene important for histidine production, so they require histidine for growth. The cells are grown on a histidine rich medium and are then transferred to a medium that lacks histidine and contains the potential mutagenic substance. If the mutagenic substance causes mutations, there is a very small chance that another mutation occurs in the histidine gene which again enables the production of histidine. These cells are then able to grow on the medium lacking histidine. The mutagenicity of a compound is calculated by the number of yeast colonies which are reverted to the histidine-independent form. In one study, the Ames test was executed with benzo[\"c\"]fluorene. Two different strains were used, TA100 and TA98. One group of each strain had a rat liver fraction and one group did not. The difference between the TA100 and the TA98 strain is that the TA98 strain has a frameshift mutation, and the TA100 has a base substitution mutation. When the amount of benzo[\"c\"]fluorene is increased in TA 100 yeast strain, the amount of revertants per plate does not increase. Only in the TA98 strain plate, which contained a fraction of a rat liver, a higher dose of benzo[\"c\"]fluorene seems to correspond with a larger amount of revertants. This indicates that benzo[\"c\"]fluorene is metabolized by enzymes in the rat liver into more potent mutagenic compounds. These compounds only affected the TA98 strain.

Evidence shows that Asian earthworms grow more rapidly, reproduce more quickly, and have greater flexibility in their diet than European species. They can also exist at higher densities than European earthworm species. These characteristics may allow jumping worms to outcompete their European earthworm competitors.

The two most common methods of measuring aging in yeast are Replicative Life Span, which measures the number of times a cell divides, and Chronological Life Span, which measures how long a cell can survive in a non-dividing stasis state. Limiting the amount of glucose or amino acids in the growth medium has been shown to increase RLS and CLS in yeast as well as other organisms. At first, this was thought to increase RLS by up-regulating the sir2 enzyme, however it was later discovered that this effect is independent of sir2. Over-expression of the genes sir2 and fob1 has been shown to increase RLS by preventing the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles, which are thought to be one of the causes of senescence in yeast. The effects of dietary restriction may be the result of a decreased signaling in the TOR cellular pathway. This pathway modulates the cell's response to nutrients, and mutations that decrease TOR activity were found to increase CLS and RLS. This has also been shown to be the case in other animals. A yeast mutant lacking the genes sch9 and ras2 has recently been shown to have a tenfold increase in chronological lifespan under conditions of calorie restriction and is the largest increase achieved in any organism.",

In the case of siderophore production, there must be equilibrium between the microbes that spend their energy to produce the chelating agents, and those that can utilize xenosiderophores. Otherwise, the exploitative microbes would eventually out-compete the producers, leaving a community with no organisms able to produce siderophores, and thus, unable to survive in low iron conditions. This ability to balance between the two populations is currently being researched. It is thought to be due to the presence of low-affinity receptors on the non-producers, or producers generating a toxin-mediated interference mechanism. While the production of public goods aims to benefit all individuals, it also leads to the evolution of cheaters, or individuals that do not pay the cost of producing a good, but still receive benefits (Figure 1). In order to minimize fitness costs, natural selection will favor individuals that do not to secrete while taking advantage of the secretions of their neighbors. In a population of siderophore secreting cells, non-secreting mutant cells do not pay the cost of secretion, but still gain the same benefit as the wild-type neighbors. Recently, Griffin et al. (2004) investigated the social nature of the production of siderophores in \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\". When cells were grown in pure culture were placed in an iron-limiting environment, populations of cells that secreted siderophores (wild-type) outcompeted a population of mutant non-secretors. Therefore, siderophore production is beneficial when iron is limiting. However, when the same populations were placed in an iron-rich environment, the mutant population outcompeted wild-type population, demonstrating that siderophore production is metabolically costly. Finally, when both wild type and mutant bacteria were placed in the same mixed population, the mutants can gain the benefit of siderophore production without paying the cost, and hence increase in frequency.
