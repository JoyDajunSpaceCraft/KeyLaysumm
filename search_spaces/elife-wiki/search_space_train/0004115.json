Two bacterial strains of the genus \"Leucobacter\" were co-isolated from nature with the two \"Caenorhabditis\" species \"C. briggsae\" and \"C. n. spp 11\", and named Verde1 and Verde2. These two \"Leucobacter\" strains showed contrasting pathogenic effects in \"C. elegans\". Worms that were infected with Verde2 produced a deformed anal region (\u201cDar\u201d phenotype), while infections with Verde1 resulted in slower growth due to coating of the cuticle with the bacterial strain. In liquid culture Verde1 infected worms stuck together with their tails and formed so called \u201cworm stars\u201d. The trapped worms cannot free themselves and eventually die. After death \"C. elegans\" is then used as a food source for the bacteria. Only larvae in the L4 stage seem to be able to escape by autotomy. They split their bodies into half, so that the anterior half can escape. The \u201chalf-worms\u201d remain viable for several days.  The Gram-positive bacterium \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" is likely associated with \"C. elegans\" in nature. \"B. thuringiensis\" is a soil bacterium that is often used in infection experiments with \"C. elegans\". It produces spore-forming toxins, called crystal (Cry) toxins, which are associated with spores. These are jointly taken up by \"C. elegans\" orally. Inside the host, the toxins bind to the surface of intestinal cells, where the formation of pores in intestinal cells is induced, causing their destruction. The resulting change in milieu in the gut leads to germination of the spores, which subsequently proliferate in the worm body. An interesting aspect of the \"C. elegans\"\u2013\"B. thuringiensis\" system is the high variability in pathogenicity between different strains. There are highly pathogenic strains, but also strains that are less or even non-pathogenic.",

One of the best studied natural pathogens of \"C. elegans\" is the microsporidium \"Nematocida parisii\", which was directly isolated from wild-caught \"C. elegans\". \"N. parisii\" is an intracellular parasite that is exclusively transmitted horizontally from one animal to another. The microsporidian spores are likely to exit the cells by disrupting a conserved cytoskeletal structure in the intestine called the terminal web. It seems that none of the known immune pathways of \"C. elegans\" is involved in mediating resistance against \"N. parisii\". Microsporidia were found in several nematodes isolated from different locations, indicating that microsporidia are common natural parasites of \"C. elegans\". The \"N. parisii\"-\"C. elegans\" system represents a very useful tool to study infection mechanisms of intracellular parasites. Additionally, a new species of microsporidia was recently found in a wild caught \"C. elegans\" that genome sequencing places in the same genus \"Nematocida\" as prior microsporidia seen in these nematodes. This new species was named \"Nematocida displodere,\" after a phenotype seen in late infected worms that explode at the vulva to release infectious spores. \"N. displodere\" was shown to infect a broad range of tissues and cell types in \"C. elegans\", including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, seam cells, and coelomocytes. Strangely, the majority of intestinal infection fails to grow to later parasite stages, while the muscle and epidermal infection thrives. This is in stark contrast to \"N. parisii\" which infects and completes its entire life cycle in the \"C. elegans\" intestine. These related \"Nematocida\" species are being used to study the host and pathogen mechanisms responsible for allowing or blocking eukaryotic parasite growth in different tissue niches.  Another eukaryotic pathogen is the fungus \"Drechmeria coniospora\", which has not been directly co-isolated with \"C. elegans\" from nature, but is still considered to be a natural pathogen of \"C. elegans\". \"D. coniospora\" attaches to the cuticle of the worm at the vulva, mouth, and anus and its hyphae penetrate the cuticle. In this way \"D. coniospora\" infects the worm from the outside, while the majority of bacterial pathogens infect the worm from the intestinal lumen",

Fortunately, DNA has evolved processes in which it has the ability to repair itself. If the damages are not repaired and it continues to grow, mutagenic changes occur causing ageing and cancer. Boulton is responsible for identifying these new DNA repair genes, understanding how these genes work in DNA, and determining how the defects in these processes contribute to human diseases. To fulfil these tasks, Boulton studies the DNA damage repair inside a specific worm called C. elegans, then extends these findings to human cells. Through this process, he has found \"remarkable similarities between the genes and proteins used to repair DNA damage in the worm and in humans...By studying this fundamental process of DNA damage repair, the researchers have contributed to our understanding of how faults in the system can lead to cancer.\" Boulton's research has resulted in several major breakthroughs that are viewed as highly promising with regard to the potential development of new cancer treatments.",

In its natural environment \"C. elegans\" is confronted with a variety of different potential pathogens. \"C. elegans\" has been used intensively as a model organism for studying host-pathogen interactions and the immune system. These studies revealed that \"C. elegans\" has well-functioning innate immune defences. The first line of defence is the extremely tough cuticle that provides an external barrier against pathogen invasion. In addition, several conserved signalling pathways contribute to defence, including the DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like receptor pathway and several MAP kinase  pathways, which activate physiological immune responses. Finally, pathogen avoidance behaviour represents another line of \"C. elegans\" immune defence. All these defence mechanisms do not work independently, but jointly to ensure an optimal defence response against pathogens. Many microorganisms were found to be pathogenic for \"C. elegans\" under laboratory conditions. To identify potential \"C. elegans\" pathogens, worms in the L4 larval stage are transferred to a medium that contains the organism of interest, which is a bacterium in most cases. Pathogenicity of the organism can be inferred by measuring the lifespan of worms. There are several known human pathogens that have a negative effect on \"C. elegans\" survival.

Another experimental setup allowed worm or anti-worm stimuli to traverse the toad's visual field in different direction in the x-y co-ordinates, demonstrating that the worm vs anti-worm discrimination is invariant under changes in the direction of movement. He also showed that the toad would crouch and go immobile in response to a large rectangle. Using worm and anti-worm stimuli like these, Ewert identified that the prey-recognition system in the visual pathway of the toad is based on a number of innate release mechanisms. In response to a worm-like moving stimulus, the toad exhibited the following behaviors: orienting, snapping, or mouth wiping. On the other hand, an anti-worm stimulus evoked a different set of avoidance behaviors: planting down or crouching. After determining the sensory recognition elements of each behavior with this experimental setup, Ewert and co-workers examined the neural mechanisms governing the toad's prey-recognition system and found a number of feature detectors.",

Most of the studies on \"C. elegans\" are based on the N2 strain, which has adapted to laboratory conditions. Only in the last few years the natural ecology of \"C. elegans\" has been studied in more detail and one current research focus is its interaction with microbes. As \"C. elegans\" feeds on bacteria (microbivory), the intestine of worms isolated from the wild is usually filled with a large number of bacteria. In contrast to the very high diversity of bacteria in the natural habitat of \"C. elegans\", the lab strains are only fed with one bacterial strain, the Escherichia coli derivate OP50  . OP50 was not co-isolated with \"C. elegans\" from nature, but was rather used because of its high convenience for laboratory maintenance. Bleaching is a common method in the laboratory to clean \"C. elegans\" of contaminations and to synchronize a population of worms. During bleaching the worms are treated with 5N NaOH and household bleach, leading to the death of all worms and survival of only the nematode eggs. The larvae hatching from these eggs lack any microbes, as none of the currently known \"C. elegans\"-associated microbes can be transferred vertically. Since most laboratory strains are kept under these gnotobiotic conditions, nothing is known about the composition of the \"C. elegans\" microbiota. The ecology of \"C. elegans\" can only be fully understood in the light of the multiple interactions with the microorganisms, which it encounters in the wild.

Under environmental conditions that are favorable for reproduction, \"C. elegans\" larvae develop through four stages or moults which are designated as \"L1\", \"L2\", \"L3\" and \"L4\". After L4, animals moult to the reproductive adult stage. However, when the environment is unfavorable, L1 and L2 animals have the option to divert their development from reproduction to dauer formation. Signals such as temperature, food supply, and levels of a dauer-inducing pheromone, a population density cue, influence this dauer decision. Dauer larvae are thus considered an alternative L3 stage larva, and this stage is sometimes preceded by L2d. L2d animals are considered pre-dauer and are characterised by delayed development and dark intestines produced by storage of fat. L2d larvae can either continue normal development or enter dauer stage depending on whether the conditions that triggered their formation persist. Dauer is not, however, a permanent condition. In fact, if the food supply and the population density become optimal for growth the dauer larvae can exit this stage and become L4s and then adults. Dauer larvae are extensively studied by biologists because of their ability to survive harsh environments and live for extended periods of time. For example, \"C. elegans\" dauer larvae can survive up to four months, much longer than their average lifespan of about three weeks during normal reproductive development. Two genes that are essential for dauer formation are \"daf-2\" and \"daf-23\". Dauer formation in \"C. elegans\" requires a nuclear receptor DAF-12 and a forkhead transcription factor \"daf-16\". In favorable environments, DAF-12 is activated by a steroid hormone, called Dafachronic Acid, produced by the cytochrome p450, DAF-9. DAF-9 and DAF-12 have been implicated by Cynthia Kenyon and colleagues as being required for extended longevity seen in animals that lack germlines. Kenyon showed that, although the \"daf-16\" gene is required for life extension in \"C. elegans\", the life extension effect can be uncoupled from dauer growth arrest. The lifespan increase was shown to be associated with an increase in stress resistance.",

These enzymes use the same substrates as long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, but have a unique purpose in that they generate the free acid and CoA, as opposed to long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, which ligate fatty acids to CoA, to produce the CoA ester. The role of the ACOT- family of enzymes is not well understood; however, it has been suggested that they play a crucial role in regulating the intracellular levels of CoA esters, Coenzyme A, and free fatty acids. Recent studies have shown that Acyl-CoA esters have many more functions than simply an energy source. These functions include allosteric regulation of enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, hexokinase IV, and the citrate condensing enzyme. Long-chain acyl-CoAs also regulate opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and activation of Calcium ATPases, thereby regulating insulin secretion. A number of other cellular events are also mediated via acyl-CoAs, for example signal transduction through protein kinase C, inhibition of retinoic acid-induced apoptosis, and involvement in budding and fusion of the endomembrane system. Acyl-CoAs also mediate protein targeting to various membranes and regulation of G Protein \u03b1 subunits, because they are substrates for protein acylation. In the mitochondria, acyl-CoA esters are involved in the acylation of mitochondrial NAD+ dependent dehydrogenases; because these enzymes are responsible for amino acid catabolism, this acylation renders the whole process inactive. This mechanism may provide metabolic crosstalk and act to regulate the NADH/NAD+ ratio in order to maintain optimal mitochondrial beta oxidation of fatty acids. The role of CoA esters in lipid metabolism and numerous other intracellular processes are well defined, and thus it is hypothesized that ACOT- enzymes play a role in modulating the processes these metabolites are involved in. There are many orthologs of ACOT9, the house mouse (\"Mus musculus\") being one of the most similar, where the ACOT9 gene is found at 72.38cM on chromosome X.

Juvenile worms establish in the bile duct of mice after approximately 3 days movement within the upper gastrointestinal tract.

Additionally, a new species of microsporidia was recently found in a wild caught \"C. elegans\" that genome sequencing places in the same genus \"Nematocida\" as prior microsporidia seen in these nematodes. This new species was named \"Nematocida displodere,\" after a phenotype seen in late infected worms that explode at the vulva to release infectious spores. \"N. displodere\" was shown to infect a broad range of tissues and cell types in \"C. elegans\", including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, seam cells, and coelomocytes.

This is in stark contrast to \"N. parisii\" which infects and completes its entire life cycle in the \"C. elegans\" intestine.

To extract the worm, a person must wrap the live worm around a piece of gauze or a stick. The process may take several weeks. Gently massaging the area around the blister can help loosen the worm. This is nearly the same treatment that is noted in the famous ancient Egyptian medical text, the Ebers papyrus from c. 1550 BC.

The skin may become thicker as well, and the condition may become painful. The changes to the body may harm the affected person's social and economic situation. The worms are spread by the bites of infected mosquitoes. Three types of worms are known to cause the disease: \"Wuchereria bancrofti\", \"Brugia malayi\", and \"Brugia timori\", with \"Wuchereria bancrofti\" being the most common. These worms damage the lymphatic system. The disease is diagnosed by microscopic examination of blood collected during the night. The blood is typically examined as a smear after being stained with Giemsa stain. Testing the blood for antibodies against the disease may also permit diagnosis. Other roundworms from the same family are responsible for river blindness. Prevention can be achieved by treating entire groups in which the disease exists, known as mass deworming. This is done every year for about six years, in an effort to rid a population of the disease entirely. Medications used include antiparasitics such as albendazole with ivermectin, or albendazole with diethylcarbamazine. The medications do not kill the adult worms but prevent further spread of the disease until the worms die on their own. Efforts to prevent mosquito bites are also recommended, including reducing the number of mosquitoes and promoting the use of bed nets. In 2015 about 38.5 million people were infected. About 950 million people are at risk of the disease in 54 countries. It is most common in tropical Africa and Asia.
