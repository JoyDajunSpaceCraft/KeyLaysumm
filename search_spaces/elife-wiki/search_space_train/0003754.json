Horizontal gene transfer took place through an pre-Dikarya divergent fungal lineage and a \"Nostocale\" or soil-sediment bacterium through symbiosis. The fungal PAL was then transferred to an ancestor of a land plant by an ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis that later developed in the phenylpropanoid pathway and land plant colonization.

After some success with this approach\u2014they identified one of the intermediate pigments shortly after another researcher, Adolf Butenandt, beat them to the discovery\u2014Beadle and Tatum switched their focus to an organism that made genetic studies of biochemical traits much easier: the bread mold \"Neurospora crassa\", which had recently been subjected to genetic research by one of Thomas Hunt Morgan's researchers, Carl C. Lingegren. \"Neurospora\" had several advantages: it required a simple growth medium, it grew quickly, and because of the production of ascospores during reproduction it was easy to isolate genetic mutants for analysis. They produced mutations by exposing the fungus to X-rays, and then identified strains that had metabolic defects by varying the growth medium. This work of Beadle and Tatum led almost at once to an important generalization. This was that most mutants unable to grow on minimal medium but able to grow on \u201ccomplete\u201d medium each require addition of only one particular supplement for growth on minimal medium. If the synthesis of a particular nutrient (such as an amino acid or vitamin) was disrupted by mutation, that mutant strain could be grown by adding the necessary nutrient to the medium. This finding suggested that most mutations affected only a single metabolic pathway. Further evidence obtained soon after the initial findings tended to show that generally only a single step in the pathway is blocked. Following their first report of three such \"auxotroph\" mutants in 1941, Beadle and Tatum used this method to create series of related mutants and determined the order in which amino acids and some other metabolites were synthesized in several metabolic pathways. The obvious inference from these experiments was that each gene mutation affects the activity of a single enzyme. This led directly to the one gene\u2013one enzyme hypothesis, which, with certain qualifications and refinements, has remained essentially valid to the present day. As recalled by Horowitz et al., the work of Beadle and Tatum also demonstrated that genes have an essential role in biosyntheses. At the time of the experiments (1941), non-geneticists still generally believed that genes governed only trivial biological traits, such as eye color, and bristle arrangement in fruit flies, while basic biochemistry was determined in the cytoplasm by unknown processes. Also, many respected geneticists thought that gene action was far too complicated to be resolved by any simple experiment. Thus Beadle and Tatum brought about a fundamental revolution in our understanding of genetics.",

These mutants enforced the idea that plant root endosymbioses with bacteria and fungi share a common genetic basis. Because arbuscular mycorrhiza dates back to the first land plant and the root nodule symbiosis is much younger, this common gene set revealed that the nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis evolved by co-opting genes from the existing arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. By map-based identification of so-called \u201ccommon symbiosis genes\u201d, the Parniske lab contributed to the identification of several components directly or indirectly involved in a plant signal transduction process required for both symbioses. These include a receptor-like kinase, nucleoporins, potassium channels required for nuclear calcium oscillations and a nuclear localized complex comprising a calcium-and-calmodulin dependent protein kinase and its phosphorylation target CYCLOPS, a DNA-binding transcriptional activator. The discovery of these genes and the postulated signal transduction processes had a major impact on this research field. The Parniske lab discovered that CYCLOPS is an interactor and phosphorylation substrate of the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CCaMK. Moreover, the role of CYCLOPS, initially annotated as a protein with unknown function, was identified as a DNA-binding transcriptional activator.

The two \"pan-2\" mutations B5 and B3 are located at different sites in the \"pan-2\" gene, so that a cross of B5 \u00b4 B3 yields wild-type recombinants at low frequency. An analysis of 939 asci in which the genotypes of all meiotic products (ascospores) could be determined found 11 asci with an exceptional segregation pattern. These included six asci in which there was one wild-type meiotic product but no expected reciprocal double-mutant (B5B3) product. Furthermore, in three asci the ratio of meiotic products was 1B5:3B3, rather than in the expected 2:2 ratio. This study, as well as numerous additional studies in \"N. crassa\" and other fungi (reviewed by Whitehouse), led to an extensive characterization of gene conversion. It became clear from this work that gene conversion events arise when a molecular recombination event happens to occur near the genetic markers under study (e.g. \"pan-2\" mutations in the above example). Thus studies of gene conversion allowed insight into the details of the molecular mechanism of recombination. Over the decades since the original observations of Mary Mitchell in 1955, a sequence of molecular models of recombination have been proposed based on both emerging genetic data from gene conversion studies and studies of the reaction capabilities of DNA. Current understanding of the molecular mechanism of recombination is discussed in the Wikipedia articles Gene conversion and Genetic recombination. An understanding of recombination is relevant to several fundamental biologic problems, such the role of recombination and recombinational repair in cancer (see BRCA1) and the adaptive function of meiosis (see Meiosis).",

In a recent study, growth was found to be greater when arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were present in soil with low phosphorus concentrations, compared to when the plant was placed in an environment with high soil phosphorus concentrations with no arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were present. The results from this study show the importance of symbiotic relationships in allowing Oriental bittersweet to effectively uptake nutrients from its surroundings. Additionally, the symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizae allows this invasive species to utilize less of its energy in root biomass to absorb necessary nutrients. This may be crucial in allowing Oriental bittersweet to act as an effective invasive species as it is able to allocate more energy to its aboveground biomass instead of its belowground biomass; a significant point regarding this plant\u2019s invasiveness relies on photosynthetic ability and reproductive capacity. It should be noted that the symbiotic relationship established with fungi only occurs with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while no such relationship has been observed with ectomycorrhizal fungi.

The researchers looked at the pattern of segments and denticles in each mutant under the microscope, and were therefore able to work out that particular genes were involved in different processes during development based on their differing mutant phenotypes (such as fewer segments, gaps in the normal segment pattern, and alterations in the patterns of denticles on the segments). Many of these genes were given descriptive names based on the appearance of the mutant larvae, such as \"hedgehog\", \"gurken\" (German: \"cucumbers\"), and \"Kr\u00fcppel\" ( \"cripple\").

In a recent study, growth was found to be greater when arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were present in soil with low phosphorus concentrations, compared to when the plant was placed in an environment with high soil phosphorus concentrations with no arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were present. The results from this study show the importance of symbiotic relationships in allowing Oriental bittersweet to effectively uptake nutrients from its surroundings. Additionally, the symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizae allows this invasive species to utilize less of its energy in root biomass to absorb necessary nutrients. This may be crucial in allowing Oriental bittersweet to act as an effective invasive species as it is able to allocate more energy to its aboveground biomass instead of its belowground biomass; a significant point regarding this plant\u2019s invasiveness relies on photosynthetic ability and reproductive capacity. It should be noted that the symbiotic relationship established with fungi only occurs with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while no such relationship has been observed with ectomycorrhizal fungi.

Studies have also shown evidence that \u201cintroduced plant species can modify microbial communities in the soil surrounding not only their own roots, but also the roots of neighboring plants, thereby altering competitive interactions among the plant species\u201d.

PAL in some plants and fungi also has a tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) for the synthesis of p-coumaric acid into p-coumaroyl-CoA. PAL likely emerged from bacteria in an antimicrobial role. Horizontal gene transfer took place through an pre-Dikarya divergent fungal lineage and a \"Nostocale\" or soil-sediment bacterium through symbiosis. The fungal PAL was then transferred to an ancestor of a land plant by an ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis that later developed in the phenylpropanoid pathway and land plant colonization. PAL enzymes in early bacteria and fungi could have contributed to protection against ultraviolet radiation, acted as a light capturing pigment, or assisted in antimicrobial defense.",

A large body of research has shown that AM fungi can, and do, transfer nitrogen to plants and transfer nitrogen between plants, including crop plants. However, it has not been shown conclusively that there is a growth benefit from AM due to nitrogen. Some researchers doubt that AM contribute significantly to plant N status in nature. In one field study, there was negligible transfer between soybeans and corn. Furthermore, AM sometimes appears to be parasitic. This has primarily been seen under conditions of high nitrogen, which is not the usual state in a natural environment. However, it has been shown that in at least one case, colonization by AM fungi under nitrogen-limiting conditions lead to decreased shoot biomass, implying that the relationship does the plant more harm than good. Likewise in a multi-plant system it would be very difficult to find the advantage to the source plants when their nutrients are being shunted to sink plants. These findings are at odds with the observed phenomenon that under conditions of low phosphorus, the degree of AM colonization is inversely proportional to nitrogen availability. Since the plant must supply all of the energy needed to grow and sustain the fungus, it seems counter-intuitive that it would do so without some benefit to itself. Further studies are definitely needed to delineate the details of the relationship between the symbionts, including a gradient of interaction that runs from mutualism to parasitism.",

The life cycle of \"V. longisporum\" is very similar to that of \"V. dahliae. V. longisporum\" is able to survive using overwintering structures that can survive in the soil, called microsclerotia. Microsclerotia are masses of hyphae that are produced in the dying part of the plant and are used to infect healthy plants. When a canola root is near the microsclerotia, the fungi will grow towards it. Root exudates cause the microsclerotia to germinate. Once the fungus has entered the root, it will produce hyphae to move through the plant. The fungi also use conidia to transport. Once the fungi reaches the xylem, it can quickly colonize the plant. This causes the plant to start slowly dying. This is due to fungal growth and plant defenses clogging the xylem, so the plant cannot take up nutrients in this area. Once there is enough dead plant tissue, the fungus will produce more microsclerotia. The process will then continue to repeat. This is the only known life cycle of \"V. longisporum.\" The pathogen is only known to cause asexual disease. The fungus is primarily spread via soil cultivation, harvesting, or any action that causes movement of the soil.\"Verticillium spp.\" do a spectacular job of being able to germinate, spread within the plant, and reproduce in most weather types. With this, water is usually necessary for the germination of the resting spore to first affect plants. This causes the disease to be most infectious during the spring when there is a lot of water in the ground and new, young plants are present.",

Carbon has been shown to move from paper birch trees into Douglas-fir trees thereby promoting succession in ecosystems.

In a study by Klironomos and Hart, Eastern White Pine inoculated with \"L. bicolor\" was able to derive up to 25% of its nitrogen from springtails. When compared to non-mycorrhizal fine roots, ectomycorrhizae may contain very high concentrations of trace elements, including toxic metals (cadmium, silver) or chlorine. The first genomic sequence for a representative of symbiotic fungi, the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete \"Laccaria bicolor\", has been published. An expansion of several multigene families occurred in this fungus, suggesting that adaptation to symbiosis proceeded by gene duplication. Within lineage-specific genes those coding for symbiosis-regulated secreted proteins showed an up-regulated expression in ectomycorrhizal root tips suggesting a role in the partner communication. \"Laccaria bicolor\" is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells during the root colonisation. By contrast, \"Laccaria bicolor\" possesses expanded multigene families associated with hydrolysis of bacterial and microfauna polysaccharides and proteins.

The fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal, nutrient-absorbing root tips, often inducing a high degree of branching in the tips of the host, and penetrating into the root tissue, forming, to some mycologists, the defining feature of ectomycorrhizal relationships, a hartig net. The ectomycorrhizal fungi are then able to exchange nutrients with the plant, effectively expanding the root system of the host plant to the furthest reaches of the symbiont fungi. Compatible hosts may belong to multiple families of vascular plants that are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere; according to one 1995 estimate, there are at least 30 host plant species distributed over more than 15 genera. Examples of mycorrhizal associates include Chinese red pine, Mexican weeping pine, Scots pine, Norway spruce, Coast Douglas-fir, mountain pine, and Virginia pine.
