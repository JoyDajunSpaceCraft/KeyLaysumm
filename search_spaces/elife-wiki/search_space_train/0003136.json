Nickel enzymes such as urease are considered virulence factors in some organisms. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbamate. The NiFe hydrogenases can catalyze the oxidation of to form protons and electrons, and can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas. A nickel-tetrapyrrole coenzyme, cofactor F430, is present in methyl coenzyme M reductase, which can catalyze the formation of methane, or the reverse reaction, in methanogenic archaea. One of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an Fe-Ni-S cluster. Other nickel-bearing enzymes include a rare bacterial class of superoxide dismutase and glyoxalase I enzymes in bacteria and several parasitic eukaryotic trypanosomal parasites (in higher organisms, including yeast and mammals, this enzyme contains divalent Zn).",

            "document": "Fumarate reductase (quinol) . To date, a number of QFR enzymes have been crystalized and the specifics of enzyme structure varies between organisms; however, the overall structure remains similar across different species. Fumarate reductase complexes include four subunits. Subunit A contains the site of fumarate reduction and a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group. It is closely bound to subunit B, which contains three iron-sulfur centers, all placed near to each other and the nearby substrates. Subunit C consists of hydrophobic membrane-spanning, primarily helical segments and is the site of quinol oxidization. In some fumarate reductase structures, one or more heme groups are additionally bound to the C subunit and participate in the electron transfer. The D subunit contains hydrophobic alpha helices that span the membrane, but does not participate in the catalytic action of the enzyme. It may be required to anchor the catalytic components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic membrane. The reduction of fumarate in fumarate reductase is achieved via the oxidation of a quinol bound to subunit C and the resulting transfer of electrons down a chain of iron-sulfur clusters onto a waiting FAD molecule. The edge-to-edge distances between the quinol, the iron sulfur clusters, and the FAD in this enzyme do not exceed 12.5 Angstroms and can be seen on the image below. These short distances between electron receptors allow electrons to travel down the chain at a physiologically reasonable timescale. Once electrons have travelled down the iron-sulfur clusters, they pass onto the FAD molecule bound to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The final reduction of the fumarate is achieved in the active site where the asymmetrical charges from the nearby amino acids polarize the fumarate and distort its shape. Once the fumarate is no longer planar, a hydride from the bound FAD molecule in the active site attacks the double bond to reduce the fumarate. Thus, in this reaction, the fumarate serves as the terminal electron acceptor.  Succinate dehydrogenase (SQR) is a key enzyme in both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain in the mitochondria of eukaryotes and single celled organisms. It is a key enzyme in aerobic respiration and it performs the opposite reaction of QFR, by coupling the reduction of a quinone to the formation of succinate for use in the citric acid cycle.",

            "document": "Dioxygenase . The Rieske dioxygenases catalyze the cis-dihydroxylation of arenes to cis-dihydro-diol products. These enzymes are prominently found in soil bacteria such as \"Pseudomonas\", and their reactions constitute the initial step in aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. Rieske dioxygenases are structurally more complex than other dioxygenases due to the need for an efficient electron transfer pathway (figure 2) to mediate the additional, simultaneous two-electron reduction of the aromatic substrate.  A catalytically-competent Rieske dioxygenase has three components: an NADH-dependent FAD reductase, a ferredoxin with two [2Fe-2S] Rieske clusters, and an \u03b13\u03b23 oxygenase with each \u03b1-subunit containing a mononuclear iron center and a [2Fe-2S] Rieske cluster. Within each \u03b1-subunit, the iron-sulfur cluster and mononuclear iron center are separated by a distance of some ~43 \u00c5, much too far for efficient electron transfer to occur. Instead, it is proposed electron transfer is mediated through these two centers in adjacent subunits, that the iron-sulfur cluster of one subunit transfers electrons to the mononuclear iron center of the adjacent subunit which is conveniently separated by ~12 \u00c5. While this distance would appear optimal for efficient electron transfer, replacement of the bridging aspartate residue causes a loss of enzyme function, suggesting that electron transfer instead proceeds through the hydrogen-bonding network held in place by this aspartate residue.  The mechanistic picture for this class of dioxygenases is not yet clear, but there is evidence supporting an iron(III) hydroperoxy intermediate in the reaction pathway. This species could represent the active oxidant, or it could undergo hemolytic O-O bond cleavage to yield an iron(V)-oxo intermediate as the working oxidizing agent. The Rieske dioxygenase are a powerful class of redox-active enzymes, and reactions such as sulfoxidation, desaturation, and benzylic oxidation have been reported in addition to dioxygenation. While most iron-dependent dioxygenases utilize a non-heme iron cofactor, the oxidation of L-(and D-)tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine is catalyzed by either tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which are heme dioxygenases that utilize iron coordinated by a heme B prosthetic group. While these dioxygenases are of interest in part because they uniquely use heme for catalysis, they are also of interest due to their importance in tryptophan regulation in the cell, which has numerous physiological implications. The initial association of the substrate with the dioxygen-iron in the enzyme active site is thought to either proceed via radical or electrophilic addition, requiring either ferrous iron or ferric iron, respectively. While the exact reaction mechanism for the heme-dependent dioxygenases is still under debate, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through either a dioxetane or Criegee mechanism (figures 4, 5).",

            "document": "Adsorbable organic halides . A more economically attractive option for treatment of the organic halides is through utilization of biological agents. Recently, bacteria \"(Ancylobacter aquaticus),\" fungi (\"Phanerochaete chrysosporium\" and \"Coiriolus versicolor\"), or synthetic enzymes have been used in the degradation of chlorinated organic compounds. The microorganisms degrade halocompounds using either aerobic or anaerobic processes. The mechanisms of degradation include utilization of the compound as carbon source for energy, cometabolite, or as an electron acceptor. Note that enzymatic or microbial action could be regulated through feedback inhibition-the final product in the series inhibits a reaction in the process. An example of a microbe that can degrade AOX is shown below in Figures 1 and 2. A sample dechlorination of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) such as perchloroethylene (PCE) by \"Dehalococcoides ethenogenes\" has been illustrated above. PCE is one of the highly chlorinated CAHs with no known microorganisms capable of aerobic degradation. The high electronegative character of PCE renders oxidizing agent capabilities through accepting electrons by co-metabolism or dehalorespiration. In a co-metabolism, the reduction of PCE is made feasible by the utilization of a primary metabolite for carbon and energy source. In dehalorespiration, the electron transfer from oxidation of small molecules (H is the major source; but, glucose, acetate, formate, and methanol can also be used) to PCE generates energy required for the bacterial growth. The hydrogen involved in this mechanism is often a product of another process such as fermentation of simple molecules like sugars or other complex molecules like fatty acids. Moreover, due to competition from methanogens for H, low H concentrations are favored by dechlorinating bacteria, and is often established through slow-release fermentation compounds such as fatty acids and decaying bacterial biomass. While several enzymes and electron carriers are involved in process, two enzymes perform the dechlorination reactions\u2013PCE reductive dehydrogenase (PCE-RDase) and TCE reductive dehydrogenase (TCE-RDase). The PCE-RDase is normally found freely in cytoplasm while the TCE-RDase is found attached to the exterior cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes normally utilize a metal ion cluster like Fe-S cluster to complete electron transfer cycle. Hydrogen is oxidized to generate two protons and two electrons. The removal of first chloride, which is performed by PCE-RDase, reduces PCE into TCE by reductive dehalogenation, where a hydride replaces the chlorine. The chloride lost from PCE gains the two electrons and the proton that accompanies them to form HCl. TCE can be reduced to \"cis\"-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) by either PCE-RDase or TCE-RDase. Subsequent reductions to vinyl chloride (VC) and ethylene are performed by TCE-RDase. The dechlorination of PCE to cis-DCE is faster and thermodynamically more favorable than dechlorination of cis-DCE to VC. The transformation of VC to ethylene is the slowest step of the process and hence limits the overall rate of the reaction. The rate of reductive dechlorination is also directly correlated with the number of chlorine atoms, and as such, it decreases with a decreasing number of chlorine atoms. In addition, while several groups of bacteria such as \"Desulfomonile\", \"Dehalobacter\", \"Desulfuromonas\"...etc. can perform the dehalogenation of PCE to TCE, only the \"Dehalococcoides\" group can perform the complete reductive dechlorination from PCE to ethene.",

NADPH and FAD are bound to cytoplasmic binding sites on the enzyme. Two electrons from NADPH are transported to FAD which reduces it to FADH. Then, one electron moves to one of two heme groups in the enzyme within the plane of the membrane.

This structure identified the enzyme as consisting of identical beta barrel subunits (exhibiting the TIM barrel fold, which consists of eight parallel beta strands). Dimerization was observed in which a helix from each subunit interacts with the other subunit's barrel; the authors called this feature \"helix swapping.\" The dimers can dimerize as well to form a homotetrameric enzyme. A double phosphoryl transfer mechanism was proposed on the basis of this study: this would involve breakage of PEP's phosphorus-oxygen bond to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate, followed by transfer of the phosphoryl group from the enzyme to carbon-3, forming PPR.",

            "document": "Threonine ammonia-lyase . Threonine ammonia-lyase is a tetramer of identical subunits, and is arranged as a dimer of dimers. Each subunit has two domains: a domain containing the catalytic active site and a domain with allosteric regulatory sites. The two have been shown to be distinct regions, but the regulatory site of one subunit actually interacts with the catalytic site of another subunit. Both domains contain the repeating structural motif of beta sheets surrounded by alpha helices. While the threonine binding site is not perfectly understood, structural studies do reveal how the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor is bound. The PLP cofactor is bonded to a lysine residue by means of a Schiff base, and the phosphate group of PLP is held in place by amine groups derived from a repeating sequence of glycine residues. The aromatic ring is bound to phenylalanine, and the nitrogen on the ring is hydrogen bonded to hydroxyl group-containing residues. The mechanism of threonine ammonia-lyase is analogous to other deaminating PLP enzymes in its use of Schiff base intermediates. Initially, the amine group of threonine attacks the lysine/PLP Schiff base, displacing lysine. After deprotonation of the amino acid alpha carbon and subsequent dehydration (hence the common name threonine \"dehydratase\"), a new Schiff base is formed. This Schiff base is replaced by lysine attack, reforming the catalytically active PLP and releasing an initial alkene-containing product. This product tautomerizes, and after hydrolysis of the Schiff base, the final products are generated. After the final alpha-ketobutyrate product is generated, isoleucine is synthesized by progressing through the intermediates alpha-acetohydroxybutyrate to alpha-beta-dihydroxy-beta-methylvalerate, then to alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate. Threonine ammonia-lyase has been shown to not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, rather, it is subject to complex allosteric control. The enzyme is inhibited by isoleucine, the product of the pathway it participates in, and is activated by valine, the product of a parallel pathway. Thus, an increase in isoleucine concentration shuts off its production, and an increase in valine concentration diverts starting material (Hydroxyethyl-TPP) away from valine production. The enzyme has two binding sites for isoleucine; one has a high affinity for isoleucine and the other has a low affinity. The binding of isoleucine to the high affinity site increases the binding affinity of the low affinity site, and enzyme deactivation occurs when isoleucine binds to the low affinity site. Valine promotes enzyme activity by competitively binding to the high affinity site, preventing isoleucine from having an inhibitory effect. The combination of these two feedback methods balances the concentration of BCAAs. Multiple forms of threonine ammonia-lyase have been observed in a variety of species of organism. In Escherichia Coli, a system in which the enzyme has been studied extensively, two different forms of the enzyme are found. One is biosynthetic and resembles the enzyme characteristics presented here, while the other is degradative and functions to generate carbon fragments for energy production. The pair of isoforms has also been observed in other bacteria. In many bacteria, the biodegradative isoform of the enzyme is expressed in anaerobic conditions and is promoted by cAMP and threonine, while the biosynthetic isoform is expressed in aerobic conditions. This allows the bacterium to balance energy stores and inhibit energy-consuming synthetic pathways when energy is not abundant.",

To date, a number of QFR enzymes have been crystalized and the specifics of enzyme structure varies between organisms; however, the overall structure remains similar across different species. Fumarate reductase complexes include four subunits. Subunit A contains the site of fumarate reduction and a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group. It is closely bound to subunit B, which contains three iron-sulfur centers, all placed near to each other and the nearby substrates. Subunit C consists of hydrophobic membrane-spanning, primarily helical segments and is the site of quinol oxidization. In some fumarate reductase structures, one or more heme groups are additionally bound to the C subunit and participate in the electron transfer. The D subunit contains hydrophobic alpha helices that span the membrane, but does not participate in the catalytic action of the enzyme. It may be required to anchor the catalytic components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic membrane. The reduction of fumarate in fumarate reductase is achieved via the oxidation of a quinol bound to subunit C and the resulting transfer of electrons down a chain of iron-sulfur clusters onto a waiting FAD molecule. The edge-to-edge distances between the quinol, the iron sulfur clusters, and the FAD in this enzyme do not exceed 12.5 Angstroms and can be seen on the image below. These short distances between electron receptors allow electrons to travel down the chain at a physiologically reasonable timescale. Once electrons have travelled down the iron-sulfur clusters, they pass onto the FAD molecule bound to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The final reduction of the fumarate is achieved in the active site where the asymmetrical charges from the nearby amino acids polarize the fumarate and distort its shape. Once the fumarate is no longer planar, a hydride from the bound FAD molecule in the active site attacks the double bond to reduce the fumarate. Thus, in this reaction, the fumarate serves as the terminal electron acceptor.  Succinate dehydrogenase (SQR) is a key enzyme in both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain in the mitochondria of eukaryotes and single celled organisms. It is a key enzyme in aerobic respiration and it performs the opposite reaction of QFR, by coupling the reduction of a quinone to the formation of succinate for use in the citric acid cycle.",

Six years later, Hans Gaffron observed that the green photosynthetic alga \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\", would sometimes produce hydrogen. Gaffron and many other scientists failed to elucidate how it induced hydrogen production. In the late 1990s Anastasios Melis discovered that deprivation of sulfur induces the alga to switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis) to the production of hydrogen. He found that the enzyme responsible for this reaction is hydrogenase, but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis also discovered that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted their internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen. \"Chlamydomonas moewusii\" is also a promising strain for the production of hydrogen.",

Both Complex I and Complex II of oxidative phosphorylation have multiple Fe\u2013S clusters. They have many other functions including catalysis as illustrated by aconitase, generation of radicals as illustrated by SAM-dependent enzymes, and as sulfur donors in the biosynthesis of lipoic acid and biotin. Additionally, some Fe\u2013S proteins regulate gene expression. Fe\u2013S proteins are vulnerable to attack by biogenic nitric oxide, forming dinitrosyl iron complexes.

Since discovery of ribozymes by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman in the early 1980s, ribozymes have been shown to be a distinct class of metalloenzymes. Many ribozymes require metal ions in their active sites for chemical catalysis; hence they are called metalloenzymes. Additionally, metal ions are essential for structural stabilization of ribozymes. Group I intron is the most studied ribozyme which has three metals participating in catalysis. Other known ribozymes include group II intron, RNase P, and several small viral ribozymes (such as hammerhead, hairpin, HDV, and VS) and the large subunit of ribosomes. Recently, four new classes of ribozymes have been discovered (named twister, twister sister, pistol and hatchet) which are all self-cleaving ribozymes.",

These enzymes are prominently found in soil bacteria such as \"Pseudomonas\", and their reactions constitute the initial step in aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. Rieske dioxygenases are structurally more complex than other dioxygenases due to the need for an efficient electron transfer pathway (figure 2) to mediate the additional, simultaneous two-electron reduction of the aromatic substrate.  A catalytically-competent Rieske dioxygenase has three components: an NADH-dependent FAD reductase, a ferredoxin with two [2Fe-2S] Rieske clusters, and an \u03b13\u03b23 oxygenase with each \u03b1-subunit containing a mononuclear iron center and a [2Fe-2S] Rieske cluster. Within each \u03b1-subunit, the iron-sulfur cluster and mononuclear iron center are separated by a distance of some ~43 \u00c5, much too far for efficient electron transfer to occur. Instead, it is proposed electron transfer is mediated through these two centers in adjacent subunits, that the iron-sulfur cluster of one subunit transfers electrons to the mononuclear iron center of the adjacent subunit which is conveniently separated by ~12 \u00c5. While this distance would appear optimal for efficient electron transfer, replacement of the bridging aspartate residue causes a loss of enzyme function, suggesting that electron transfer instead proceeds through the hydrogen-bonding network held in place by this aspartate residue.  The mechanistic picture for this class of dioxygenases is not yet clear, but there is evidence supporting an iron(III) hydroperoxy intermediate in the reaction pathway. This species could represent the active oxidant, or it could undergo hemolytic O-O bond cleavage to yield an iron(V)-oxo intermediate as the working oxidizing agent. The Rieske dioxygenase are a powerful class of redox-active enzymes, and reactions such as sulfoxidation, desaturation, and benzylic oxidation have been reported in addition to dioxygenation. While most iron-dependent dioxygenases utilize a non-heme iron cofactor, the oxidation of L-(and D-)tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine is catalyzed by either tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which are heme dioxygenases that utilize iron coordinated by a heme B prosthetic group. While these dioxygenases are of interest in part because they uniquely use heme for catalysis, they are also of interest due to their importance in tryptophan regulation in the cell, which has numerous physiological implications. The initial association of the substrate with the dioxygen-iron in the enzyme active site is thought to either proceed via radical or electrophilic addition, requiring either ferrous iron or ferric iron, respectively. While the exact reaction mechanism for the heme-dependent dioxygenases is still under debate, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through either a dioxetane or Criegee mechanism (figures 4, 5).",

This step is completed by the proteins HypC, HypD, HypE, and HypF. After, synthesis of the iron center, nickel is inserted using metallochaperones HypA, HypB, and SlyD. Once the catalytic center is completed, the hydrogenase precursor undergoes a C-terminal cleavage that prompts rearrangement of its structure and association with the small subunit.
