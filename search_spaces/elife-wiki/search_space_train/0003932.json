Over the past 2 decades (the cell line was established in 1992) researchers worldwide have used NK-92 cells to test their anti-cancer activity in mouse models. and also use it as a model to learn more about the biology of NK cells. NK-92 cells are a very close match with blood NK cells: they express on their surface the characteristic CD56 antigen and are negative for CD3 which is typical for T-lymphocytes. In addition they express a number of adhesion molecules such as ICAM and LFA that facilitates binding to infected and cancer cells. Blood NK cells, unlike NK-92 cells, recognize \"invaders\" or foreign cells only if those cells do not express self MHC molecules. This means if cancer cells maintain their MHC phenotype they may go unnoticed by NK cells but not of NK-92 cells. The reason for this difference in target cell recognition relates to the fact that NK-92 cells do not express killer cell immunoglobulinlike receptors (KIR) that are negative regulators of NK cell activity through interaction with self-MHC.",

Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), are a family of type I transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on the plasma membrane of natural killer (NK) cells and a minority of T cells. They regulate the killing function of these cells by interacting with major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules, which are expressed on all nucleated cell types. KIR receptors can distinguish between major histocompatibility (MHC) class I allelic variants, which allows them to detect virally infected cells or transformed cells. Most KIRs are inhibitory, meaning that their recognition of MHC molecules suppresses the cytotoxic activity of their NK cell. Only a limited number of KIRs are activating, meaning that their recognition of MHC molecules activates the cytotoxic activity of their cell. Initial expression of KIRs on NK cells is stochastic, but there is an educational process that NK cells undergo as they mature that alters the expression of KIRs to maximize the balance between effective defense and self-tolerance. As a result of KIR's role in killing unhealthy self-cells and not killing healthy self-cells, KIRs are involved in protection against and propensity to viral infection, autoimmune disease, and cancer. KIR molecules are highly polymorphic, meaning that their gene sequences differ greatly between individuals, and polygenic so that it is extremely rare for two unrelated individuals to possess the same KIR genotype.",

When the body is infected by a pathogen, na\u00efve CD8+ T cells will recognize and bind infected cells through the recognition of MHC Class I peptides on infected cells by the CD8 protein on CD8+ T cells, as previously mentioned. Once bound, CD8+ T cells will kill infected cells by secreting perforin (a pore-forming protein) and granzymes (a protease) onto infected cells. The pores formed by perforin disrupts the protective barrier of the infected cell membrane, and will enable influx of ions and water into the cell, and efflux of essential nutrients, substances and proteins out of the cell - ultimately destroying the integrity of the cell. Furthermore, the granzymes will induce programmed cell death in the infected cell. Overall, this mechanism of destruction using perforin and granzymes is a similar process to how Natural Killer (NK) cells destroy cells infected by intracellular viruses and cancer cells.",

In addition, CD16 downregulation represents a possible way to moderate NK cell responses and maintain immune homeostasis in both T cell and antibody-dependent signaling pathways. In a normal, healthy individual, cross-linking of CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIII) by immune complexes induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in NK cells. However, this pathway can also be targeted in cancerous or diseased cells by immunotherapy. After influenza vaccination, CD16 downregulation was associated with significant upregulation of influenza-specific plasma antibodies, and positively correlated with degranulation of NK cells.",

As a lineage of leukocytes, lymphocytes reside in peripheral lymphoid tissues, including lymphoid follicles and lymph nodes, and include B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells (NK cells). B cells, which act specifically, secrete antibody molecules, but do not bind MHC. T cells, which act specifically, as well as NK cells, which act innately, interact with MHC. NK cells express Killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs) that bind to MHC I molecules and signal through ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibition motif) recruitment and activation of protein tyrosine phosphatases. This means in contrast to CD8/TCR interaction that activates Tc lymphocytes, NK cells becomes deactivated when bound to MHC I. When MHC class I expression is low, as is typically the case with abnormal cell function during viral infection or tumourigenesis, NK cells lose the inhibitory KIR signal and trigger programmed cell death of the abnormal cell. NK cells thus help prevent progress of cancerous cells by contributing to tumor surveillance.",

In addition, the mechanism for such anti-apoptotic (anti-cell death) activity was studied, specifically using the chemotherapeutic Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) on osteosarcoma (Saos2) cells. Doxorubicin works by putting rampant cancer cells into a senescent state. MK, in WT-MK transfected cells versus WT cells, seemed to activate PKB (Akt), mTOR, and Bad protein, while it inactivated caspase-3. PKB, mTOR, and Bad are all elements associated with the cell cycle survival pathway, whereas caspase-3 is important in the apoptotic pathway (cell death). This indicates that MK caused the cells to initiate the survival pathway (via PKB, mTOR, and Bad activation) and inhibit the senescent or apoptotic pathway (via inhibiting caspase-3) encouraging the chemoresistance seen in resistant cells and in the co-culture experiments. The activation and inhibition of these particular factors clearly is maintaining the immortal quality inherent in cancer cells and specifically in the resistant cell types. Stat-3, however, which is another survival pathway factor, does not appear to have any change in activation between the wild type cells and the MK-transfected WT cells, as was initially believed from a previous study.",
