This superoxide can react to form hydrogen peroxide and a reactive oxygen species. The enzyme NADPH oxidase is able to generate more reactive oxygen species in the presence of arsenic, due to the subunit p22phax, which is responsible for the electron transfer, being upregulated by arsenic. The reactive oxygen species are capable of stressing the endoplasmic reticulum, which increases the amount of the unfolded protein response signals. This leads to inflammation, cell proliferation, and eventually to cell death. Another mechanism in which reactive oxygen species cause cell death would be through the cytoskeleton rearrangement, which affects the contractile proteins. The reactive nitrogen species arise once the reactive oxygen species destroy the mitochondria. This leads to the formation of the reactive nitrogen species, which are responsible for damaging DNA in arsenic poisoning. Mitochondrial damage is known to cause the release of reactive nitrogen species, due to the reaction between superoxides and nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide (NO) is a part of cell regulation, including cellular metabolism, growth, division and death. Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with reactive oxygen species to form peroxynitrite.

These cells rapidly reduce ambient 5-oxo-ETE to 5(\"S\")-HETE. However, cells suffering oxidative stress generate excesses in toxic reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (). Cells use glutathione peroxidase to detoxify this by converting it to H|2|O in a reaction that consumes glutathione by converting it to glutathione disulfide; the cells then metabolize glutathione disulfide back to glutathione in a glutathione reductase-dependent reaction that converts NADPH to NADP. While cells suffering oxidative stress can replenish NADPH by reducing NADP through the Pentose phosphate pathway, they often develop very high NADP/NADPH ratios and therefore preferentially convert 5-(\"S\")-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE.

Colony forming unit and regrowth curves showed that more than 98% of both bacterial cells lost viability at 200 \u03bcg/mL TiC colloidal solution within 4 h of exposure. Damage to the cell membrane was observed, which resulted in release of cytoplasmic materials from the bacterial cells and cell death. The principal in vitro studies of cytotoxicity of 2D sheets of MXenes showed promise for applications in bioscience and biotechnology. Presented studies of anticancer activity of the TiC MXene was determined on two normal (MRC-5 and HaCaT) and two cancerous (A549 and A375) cell lines. The cytotoxicity results indicated that the observed toxic effects were higher against cancerous cells compared to normal ones. The mechanisms of potential toxicity were also elucidated. It was shown that TiC MXene may affect the occurrence of oxidative stress and, in consequence, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further studies on TiC MXene revealed potential of MXenes as a novel ceramic photothermal agent used for cancer therapy.",

A paradox in metabolism is that, while the vast majority of complex life on Earth requires oxygen for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing reactive oxygen species. Consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as DNA, proteins and lipids. In general, antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell. However, reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions, such as redox signaling.

By directing low temperature microplasma beams at the calcified tissue structure beneath the tooth enamel coating called dentin, it severely reduces the amount of dental bacteria and in turn reduces infection. This aspect of microplasma could allow dentists to use microplasma technology to destroy bacteria in tooth cavities instead of using mechanical means. Developers claim that microplasma devices will enable dentists to effectively treat oral-borne diseases with little pain to their patients.  Recent studies show that microplasmas can be a very effective method of controlling oral biofilms. Biofilms (also known as slime) are highly organized, three-dimensional bacterial communities. Dental plaque is a common example of oral biofilms. It is the main cause of both tooth decay and periodontal diseases such as Gingivitis and Periodontitis. At the University of Southern California, Parish Sedghizadeh, Director of the USC Center for Biofilms and Chunqi Jiang, assistant research professor in the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering-Electrophysics, work with researchers from Viterbi School of Engineering searching for new ways to fight off these bacterial infections. Sedghizadeh explained that the biofilms\u2019 slimy matrix acts as extra protection against traditional antibiotics. However, the centers\u2019 study confirms that biofilms cultivated in the root canal of extracted human teeth can be easily destroyed by the application of microplasma. The plasma emission microscopy obtained during each experiment suggests that the atomic oxygen produced by the microplasma is responsible for the inactivation of bacteria. Sedghizadeh then suggested that the oxygen free radicals could disrupt the biofilms cellular membrane and cause them to break down. According to their ongoing research at USC, Sedghizadeh and Jiang have found that microplasma is not harmful to surrounding healthy tissues and they are confident that microplasma technology will soon become a groundbreaking tool in the medical industry.J.K. Lee along with other scientists in this field have found that microplasma can also be used for teeth bleaching. This reactive species can effectively bleach teeth along with saline or whitening gels that consist of hydrogen peroxide. Lee and his colleagues experimented with this method, examining how microplasma along with hydrogen peroxide effects blood stained human teeth. These scientists took forty extracted single-root, blood stained human teeth and randomly divided them into two groups of twenty. Group one received 30% hydrogen peroxide activated by microplasma for thirty minutes in a pulp chamber, while group two received 30% hydrogen peroxide alone for thirty minutes in the pulp chamber and the temperature was maintained at thirty seven degrees Celsius for both groups. After the tests had been performed, they found that microplasma treatment with 30% hydrogen peroxide had a significant effect on the whiteness of the teeth in group one.

The bleaching effect of peroxides and their salts on natural dyes became known around that time, but early attempts of industrial production of peroxides failed, and the first plant producing hydrogen peroxide was built in 1873 in Berlin. The discovery of the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by electrolysis with sulfuric acid introduced the more efficient electrochemical method. It was first implemented into industry in 1908 in Wei\u00dfenstein, Carinthia, Austria. The anthraquinone process, which is still used, was developed during the 1930s by the German chemical manufacturer IG Farben in Ludwigshafen. The increased demand and improvements in the synthesis methods resulted in the rise of the annual production of hydrogen peroxide from 35,000 tonnes in 1950, to over 100,000 tonnes in 1960, to 300,000 tonnes by 1970; by 1998 it reached 2.7 million tonnes.",

As it has been observed in other organisms (such as fungi), filamentous forms are resistant to phagocytosis. As an example of this, during urinary tract infection, filamentatious structures of uropathogenic \"E. coli\" (UPEC) start to develop in response to host innate immune response (more exactly in response to Toll-like receptor 4-TLR4). TLR-4 is stimulated by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recruits neutrophils (PMN) which are important leukocytes to eliminate these bacteria. Adopting filamentous structures, bacteria resist these phagocytic cells and their neutralizing activity (which include antimicrobial peptides, degradative enzyme and reactive oxygen species).  It is believed that filamentation is induced as a response of DNA damage (by the mechanisms previously exposed), participating SulA mechanism and additional factors. Furthermore, the length of the filamentous bacteria could have a stronger attachment to the epithelial cells, with an increased number of adhesins participating in the interaction, making even harder the work for (PMN). The interaction between phagocyte cells and adopting filamentous-shape bacteria provide an advantage to their survival. In this relate, filamentation could be not only a virulence, but also a resistance factor in these bacteria.",

There are two categories to which parts of the immune system are assigned: the non-specific, or innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.The non-specific response is a generalized response to pathogen infections involving the use of several white blood cells and plasma proteins. Non-specific immunity, or innate immunity, is the immune system with which you were born, made up of phagocytes and barriers. Phagocytosis, derived from the Greek words \u201cphagein,\u201d meaning to eat, \u201ckytos\u201d or cell, and \u201cosis\u201d meaning process, was first described by \u00c9lie Metchnikoff, who won the Noble Prize 100 years ago. Phagocytosis involves the internalization of solids, such as bacteria, by an organism.Macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are all cells of the innate immune system that utilize phagocytosis and are equipped with Toll-like receptors (TLR). Toll-like receptors are present on each of these cells and recognize a variety of microbial products resulting in the induction of more specific immune responses. When a phagocytic cell engulfs bacteria, a phagosome is formed around it and the entire complex is ultimately trafficked to the lysosome for degradation. These cells that participate in the non-specific immune system response do not differentiate between types of microorganisms but do have the ability to discern between what is self and what is non-self. The cells of this system are known as non-specific immune cells.",
