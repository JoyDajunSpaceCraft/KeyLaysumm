The germ cells are bipotential in that prior to migrating to the gonads, they are capable of forming either spermatogonia or oogonia. The specification into either female or male fates for the organism itself also depends on the development of the gonads, which have yet to differentiate into ether ovaries or testes. In the mouse, somatic sex determination (i.e. determination of either female or male gonads) begins at embryonic day 10.5 in mice, but is not finalised until day 12.5. Male somatic cell specification involves the Y-chromosome specific Sry gene, which regulates the specification of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Without the specification of those cells, the gonad formation is regulated by the X-chromosomes, forming the ovaries. After the fate of the gonads is finalised, the sex specification of the germ cells occurs at 12.5-15.5 days. Sex specification of the germ cells requires the repression of pluripotency and relies on the communication between the somatic cells of the gonads and germ cells Reitzel et al., 2015. The mechanisms for male and female differentiation are markedly different, since a population of sperm producing spermatogonia are retained throughout development and into adult life Reitzel et al., 2015, unlike oogonia which only produce oocyte in utero. When the germ cells reach the gonads, they undergo proliferation via mitosis and at 13.5 days of rat development they begin to undergo meiosis in the ovary but arrested at the mitotic stage in the testes. In the ovary, after mitosis, the gametogonium undergo meiosis, which is initiated by intrinsic competence factor DazL and extrinsic retinoic acid, excreted by the mesonephros. Retinoic acid is the major factor in meiosis, upregulating genes including \u2018\u2018Stra8\u2019\u2018, \u2018\u2018Dmc1\u2019\u2018 and \u2018\u2018Sycp3\u2019\u2018, which all have a role in meiosis. The male germ cells are protected from external signalling, like retinoic acid from the mesonephros, by the Leydig and Sertoli cells.",

            "document": "XY sex-determination system . It has long been believed that the female form was the default template for the mammalian fetuses of both sexes. After the discovery of the testis-determining gene SRY, many scientists shifted to the theory that the genetic mechanism that causes a fetus to develop into a male form was initiated by the SRY gene, which was thought to be responsible for the production of testosterone and its overall effects on body and brain development. This perspective still shares the classical way of thinking; that in order to produce two sexes, nature has developed a default female pathway and an active pathway by which male genes would initiate the process of determining a male sex, as something that is developed in addition to and based on the default female form. However, In an interview for the \"Rediscovering Biology\" website, researcher Eric Vilain described how the paradigm changed since the discovery of the SRY gene: In mammals, including humans, the SRY gene is responsible with triggering the development of non-differentiated gonads into testes, rather than ovaries. However, there are cases in which testes can develop in the absence of an SRY gene (see sex reversal). In these cases, the SOX9 gene, involved in the development of testes, can induce their development without the aid of SRY. In the absence of SRY and SOX9, no testes can develop and the path is clear for the development of ovaries. Even so, the absence of the SRY gene or the silencing of the SOX9 gene are not enough to trigger sexual differentiation of a fetus in the female direction. A recent finding suggests that ovary development and maintenance is an active process, regulated by the expression of a \"pro-female\" gene, FOXL2. In an interview for the \"TimesOnline\" edition, study co-author Robin Lovell-Badge explained the significance of the discovery: Looking into the genetic determinants of human sex can have wide-ranging consequences. Scientists have been studying different sex determination systems in fruit flies and animal models to attempt an understanding of how the genetics of sexual differentiation can influence biological processes like reproduction, ageing and disease.",

PAX10 mutations also hinder nasal cavity development due to the similar precursor structures that in small eye mice do not express PAX10 mRNA. Mice with the mutant genotype begin to be phenotypically differentiable from normal mouse embryos at about day 9 to 10 of gestation. The full elucidation of the precise mechanisms and molecular components by which the PAX6 gene influences eye, nasal and central nervous system development are still researched however, the study of PAX6 has brought more understanding to the development and genetic complexities of these mammalian body systems.",

A gametocyte in Plasmodium Falciparum is a cell specializing in the transition between the human and the mosquito host. Gametocytes arise from erythrocytic asexual stages. The production of gametocytes directly from hepatic merozoites, which has been described in other species, does not occur in P. falciparum. Gametocytes are capable of inducing specific humoral IgG, and cellular responses, which include induction of TNFa (protein coding), IFNg(gene protein coding) and gd+ lymphocyte proliferation, in addition to immune responses to other stages of the parasite. There has been much debate on the actual point of sexual differentiation and many people have shown that merozoites emerging from a single schizont developed either into further asexual stages or into gametocytes. It has been further shown that the gametocytes from one schizont are all male or all female. This suggests that the trophozoites of the preceding asexual generation were already committed to either sexual development or continuing asexual cycling. In order to adjust to life in such drastically different environments, many changes occur in its cell biology, metabolism, gene expression and protein synthesis. Gametocytes of P. falciparum have been shown to exhibit a different pattern of gene expression than asexual stages, which is unsurprising if one were to consider the difference between these two stages. Transcription and translation levels are not constant during gametocytogenesis: this was shown in drug sensitivity studies where RNA and protein synthesis levels were much more important in the early than the late gametocyte stages. Furthermore, a sex-specific expression has also been discovered, with differences in RNA, mitochondria and ribosome content. The female is preparing for a continued development, and the male is terminally differentiated and only needs what is necessary for exflagellation ( cell division cycle, dynein and \u03b1-tubulin II). Plasmodium falciparum is both the most deadly and most researched species of malaria. The majority of the research conducted is to find a vaccine or treatment for the disease. Some believe that due to the ineffectiveness of the past, any vaccine found will most likely not become completely effective. Others remain hopeful citing the fact that the species complex life cycle offers numerous options for vaccines and treatments, as well as the proof that partial immunity does occur in endemic areas in some people. Mature macrogamtocytes are female and mature microgametocytes are male. In P. falciparum, gametocytes are produced from asexual stages. All the gametocytes produced from one sexually committed schizont are of the same sex, suggesting that sex is determined at the very beginning of sexual development. However, gametocyte sex can only be microscopically differentiated from stage III and onward. They are crescent- or sausage- shaped.",

The germ cells are bipotential in that prior to migrating to the gonads, they are capable of forming either spermatogonia or oogonia. The specification into either female or male fates for the organism itself also depends on the development of the gonads, which have yet to differentiate into ether ovaries or testes. In the mouse, somatic sex determination (i.e. determination of either female or male gonads) begins at embryonic day 10.5 in mice, but is not finalised until day 12.5. Male somatic cell specification involves the Y-chromosome specific Sry gene, which regulates the specification of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Without the specification of those cells, the gonad formation is regulated by the X-chromosomes, forming the ovaries. After the fate of the gonads is finalised, the sex specification of the germ cells occurs at 12.5-15.5 days. Sex specification of the germ cells requires the repression of pluripotency and relies on the communication between the somatic cells of the gonads and germ cells Reitzel et al., 2015. The mechanisms for male and female differentiation are markedly different, since a population of sperm producing spermatogonia are retained throughout development and into adult life Reitzel et al., 2015, unlike oogonia which only produce oocyte in utero. When the germ cells reach the gonads, they undergo proliferation via mitosis and at 13.5 days of rat development they begin to undergo meiosis in the ovary but arrested at the mitotic stage in the testes. In the ovary, after mitosis, the gametogonium undergo meiosis, which is initiated by intrinsic competence factor DazL and extrinsic retinoic acid, excreted by the mesonephros.

After the discovery of the testis-determining gene SRY, many scientists shifted to the theory that the genetic mechanism that causes a fetus to develop into a male form was initiated by the SRY gene, which was thought to be responsible for the production of testosterone and its overall effects on body and brain development. This perspective still shares the classical way of thinking; that in order to produce two sexes, nature has developed a default female pathway and an active pathway by which male genes would initiate the process of determining a male sex, as something that is developed in addition to and based on the default female form. However, In an interview for the \"Rediscovering Biology\" website, researcher Eric Vilain described how the paradigm changed since the discovery of the SRY gene: In mammals, including humans, the SRY gene is responsible with triggering the development of non-differentiated gonads into testes, rather than ovaries. However, there are cases in which testes can develop in the absence of an SRY gene (see sex reversal). In these cases, the SOX9 gene, involved in the development of testes, can induce their development without the aid of SRY. In the absence of SRY and SOX9, no testes can develop and the path is clear for the development of ovaries. Even so, the absence of the SRY gene or the silencing of the SOX9 gene are not enough to trigger sexual differentiation of a fetus in the female direction. A recent finding suggests that ovary development and maintenance is an active process, regulated by the expression of a \"pro-female\" gene, FOXL2. In an interview for the \"TimesOnline\" edition, study co-author Robin Lovell-Badge explained the significance of the discovery: Looking into the genetic determinants of human sex can have wide-ranging consequences. Scientists have been studying different sex determination systems in fruit flies and animal models to attempt an understanding of how the genetics of sexual differentiation can influence biological processes like reproduction, ageing and disease.",

Humans have forty-six chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes, XX in females and XY in males. It is obvious that the Y chromosome must carry at least one essential gene which determines testicular formation (originally termed \"TDF\"). A gene in the sex-determining region of the short arm of the Y, now referred to as \"SRY\", has been found to direct production of a protein, testis determining factor, which binds to DNA, inducing differentiation of cells derived from the genital ridges into testes. In transgenic XX mice (and some human XX males), \"SRY\" alone is sufficient to induce male differentiation.",

Its expression causes the development of primary sex cords, which later develop into seminiferous tubules. These cords form in the central part of the yet-undifferentiated gonad, turning it into a testis. The now-induced Leydig cells of the testis then start secreting testosterone, while the Sertoli cells produce anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone.

During gestation, the cells of the primordial gonad that lie along the urogenital ridge are in a bipotential state, meaning they possess the ability to become either male cells (Sertoli and Leydig cells) or female cells (follicle cells and Theca cells). TDF initiates testis differentiation by activating male-specific transcription factors that allow these bipotential cells to differentiate and proliferate. TDF accomplishes this by upregulating SOX9, a transcription factor with a DNA-binding site very similar to TDF's. SOX9 leads to the upregulation of fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9), which in turn leads to further upregulation of SOX9 . Once proper SOX9 levels are reached, the bipotential cells of the gonad begin to differentiate into Sertoli cells. Additionally, cells expressing TDF will continue to proliferate to form the primordial testis. While this constitutes the basic series of events, this brief review should be taken with caution since there are many more factors that influence sex differentiation.",

SOX-9 also plays a pivotal role in male sexual development; by working with Sf1, SOX-9 can produce AMH in Sertoli cells to inhibit the creation of a female reproductive system. It also interacts with a few other genes to promote the development of male sexual organs. The process starts when the transcription factor Testis determining factor (encoded by the sex-determining region SRY of the Y chromosome) activates SOX-9 activity by binding to an enhancer sequence upstream of the gene. Next, Sox9 activates FGF9 and forms feedforward loops with FGF9 and PGD2. These loops are important for producing SOX-9; without these loops, SOX-9 would run out and the development of a female would almost certainly ensue. Activation of FGF9 by SOX-9 starts vital processes in male development, such as the creation of testis cords and the multiplication of Sertoli cells. The association of SOX-9 and Dax1 actually creates Sertoli cells, another vital process in male development.",
