Molybdenum (Mo) is the most abundant transition element in solution in the sea (mostly as dianionic molybdate ion) and in living organisms, its abundance in the Earth\u2019s crust is quite low. Therefore, the use of Mo by living organisms seems surprising at first glance. Archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, including humans, require molybdenum. It is also found in over 50 different enzymes. Its hydrolysis to water-soluble oxo-anionic species makes Mo readily accessible. Mo is found in the active sites of metalloenzymes that perform key transformations in the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, arsenic, selenium, sulfur, and chlorine compounds. The mononuclear Mo enzymes are widely distributed in the biosphere; they catalyze many significant reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds as well as various carbonyl compounds (e.g., aldehydes, CO, and CO). Nitrate reductases enzymes are important for the nitrogen cycle. They belong to a class of enzymes with a mononuclear Mo center and they catalyze the metabolism reaction of C, N, S, etc., in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans. Due to the oxidation of sulfides, The first considerable development was that of aerobic bacteria which could now utilize Mo. As oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere and oceans, the reaction of MoS to MoO also increased. This reaction made the highly soluble molybdate ion available for incorporation into critical metalloenzymes, and may have thus allowed life to thrive. It allowed organisms to occupy new ecological niches. Mo plays an important role in the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia, which occurs in one type of nitrogenases. These enzymes are used by bacteria that usually live in a symbiotic relationship with plants; their role is nitrogen fixation, which is vital for sustaining life on earth. Mo enzymes also play important roles in sulfur metabolism of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.",

Secondary metabolism produces a large number of specialized compounds (estimated 200,000) that do not aid in the growth and development of plants but are required for the plant to survive in its environment. Secondary metabolism is connected to primary metabolism by using building blocks and biosynthetic enzymes derived from primary metabolism. Primary metabolism governs all basic physiological processes that allow a plant to grow and set seeds, by translating the genetic code into proteins, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Specialized compounds from secondary metabolism are essential for communicating with other organisms in mutualistic (e.g. attraction of beneficial organisms such as pollinators) or antagonistic interactions (e.g. deterrent against herbivores and pathogens). They further assist in coping with abiotic stress such as increased UV-radiation. The broad functional spectrum of specialized metabolism is still not fully understood. In any case, a good balance between products of primary and secondary metabolism is best for a plant\u2019s optimal growth and development as well as for its effective coping with often changing environmental conditions.

Plants that use the C carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases fixation and, thus, the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf. plants can produce more sugar than plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called C plants because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle.

The other type, haloperoxidases, takes bromine from seawater along with hydrogen peroxide and converts them into organobromine compounds. These unique vanadium complexes, as well as others are found in some terrestrial beings such as mushrooms. Additionally, these compounds may provide very useful for humans as they have been found to help people with diabetes by improving glucose control. The Pecoraro group has taken these interesting applications of vanadium and started research to more fully understand them. In particular, the haloperoxidases have been a main focus on research. First, the group synthesized vanadium complexes to mock the vanadium haloperoxidases in order to gain an understanding of the mechanism. Not only did their system efficiently catalyze the reaction, but they were also able to collect valuable kinetic data and come up with a proposed catalytic cycle as seen below. The information showed that an acid/base was necessary for catalysis to occur. With this information in hand, efforts are underway to understand how these complexes are activated naturally to allow halide oxidation. Also, they are working to understand the structures of the inactive forms of these vanadium based haloperoxidases.

The meaning of \"plant-derived\" has also been attached to the term \"bioidentical\", and it may also mean that the hormones are \"natural\"; throughout the 1990s plant-derived, compounded hormones were referred to as \"natural hormone therapy\". However, the term \"natural\" can be applied to all products where the principal ingredient originates from an animal, plant, or mineral source, and both bioidentical and nonbioidentical hormones can be produced from the same plant sources.",

They have similar activity and are often found together in plants of the genus \"Calotropis\". It is thought that the biosynthesis of calotropin is similar to that of digitoxin, another cardenolide. Digitoxin is more established as a medicine for cardiac insufficiency, and therefore the biosynthesis has been further studied. However, it is believed that many cardenolides are synthesized in plants by a similar process, but this process is not yet well understood. The sterol precursor for this process is similar to precursors for steroidal alkaloids. Two suggested pathways, the pregnane pathway and norcholanic acid pathway are possible for the conversion of the sterol precursor to digitoxigenin, the precursor to digitoxin. Both the pregnane and norcholanic acid pathways use progesterone 5\u03b2-reductases, the P5\u03b2R and P5\u03b2R2 respectively. In the pregnane pathway, a plant analog of the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 (CYP11A in humans), is thought to catalyze the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. Progesterone is further processed by P5\u03b2R to 5\u03b2-Pregnane-3,20-dione, and then to digitoxigenin. Less is known about the norcholanic acid pathway. At this point the similarities between digitoxin and calotropin end. Calotropogenin may be produced by the same process as digitoxigenin, however the mechanism for production of calotropin and digitoxin from these genins diverges.

When the cell is damaged, the myrosinases hydrolise the glucosinolates, leading to the synthesis of isothiocyanates, which are compounds toxic to most animals, fungi and bacteria. Some insect herbivores have developed counter adaptations such as rapid absorption of the glucosinates, quick alternative breakdown into non-toxic compounds and avoiding cell damage. In the whites family (Pieridae), one counter mechanisme involves glucosinolate sulphatase, which changes the glucosinolate, so that it cannot be converted to isothiocyanate. A second is that the glucosinates are quickly broken down, forming nitriles. Differences between the mixtures of glucosinolates between species and even within species is large, and individual plants may produce in excess of fifty individual substances. The energy penalty for synthesising all these glucosinolates may be as high as 15% of the total needed to produce a leaf. \"Bittercress\" (\"Barbarea vulgaris\") also produces triterpenoid saponins. These adaptations and counter adaptations probably have led to extensive diversification in both the Brassicaceae and one of its major pests, the butterfly family Pieridae. A particular cocktail of volatile glucosinates triggers egg-laying in many species. Thus a particular crop can sometimes be protected by planting bittercress as a deadly bait, for the saponins kill the caterpillars, but the butterfly is still lured by the bittercress to lay its egg on the leaves. A moth that feeds on a range of Brassicaceae is the diamondback moth (\"Plutella xylostella\"). Like the Pieridae, it is capable of converting isothiocyanates into less problematic nitriles. Managing this pest in crops became more complicated after resistance developed against a toxin produced by \"Bacillus thuringiensis\", which is used as a wide spectrum biological plant protection against caterpillars. Parasitoid wasps that feed on such insect herbivores are attracted to the chemical compounds released by the plants, and thus are able to locate their prey. The cabbage aphid (\"Brevicoryne brassicae\") stores glucosinolates and synthesises its own myrosinases, which may deter its potential predators.",

The strains have been altered with a mutation in a gene important for histidine production, so they require histidine for growth. The cells are grown on a histidine rich medium and are then transferred to a medium that lacks histidine and contains the potential mutagenic substance. If the mutagenic substance causes mutations, there is a very small chance that another mutation occurs in the histidine gene which again enables the production of histidine. These cells are then able to grow on the medium lacking histidine. The mutagenicity of a compound is calculated by the number of yeast colonies which are reverted to the histidine-independent form. In one study, the Ames test was executed with benzo[\"c\"]fluorene. Two different strains were used, TA100 and TA98. One group of each strain had a rat liver fraction and one group did not. The difference between the TA100 and the TA98 strain is that the TA98 strain has a frameshift mutation, and the TA100 has a base substitution mutation. When the amount of benzo[\"c\"]fluorene is increased in TA 100 yeast strain, the amount of revertants per plate does not increase. Only in the TA98 strain plate, which contained a fraction of a rat liver, a higher dose of benzo[\"c\"]fluorene seems to correspond with a larger amount of revertants. This indicates that benzo[\"c\"]fluorene is metabolized by enzymes in the rat liver into more potent mutagenic compounds. These compounds only affected the TA98 strain. This indicates that the adducts formed by benzo[\"c\"]fluorene metabolites cause frameshift mutations, and not point mutations.",

The general process of winemaking is initiated by the enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds by polyphenol oxidases. Contact between the phenolic compounds in the Vacuole of the grape cell and the Polyphenol oxidase Enzyme (located in the cytoplasm) triggers the oxidation of the grape. Thus, the initial browning of grapes occurs as a result of \"compartmentalization modification\" in the cells of the grape. Enzymatic browning affects the color, flavor, and nutritional value of foods, causing huge economic loss when not sold to consumers on time. It is estimated that more than 50% of produce is lost as a result of enzymatic browning. The increase in human population and consequential depletion in our natural resources has prompted many biochemists and Food engineers alike to find new and improved techniques to preserve food longer, by using methods to inhibit the browning reaction, and effectively increase the shelf life of foods. A better understanding of the enzymatic browning mechanisms, specifically, understanding the properties of the enzymes and substrates that are involved in the reaction, may help food technologists to control certain stages in the mechanism and inhibit browning.",

Sorghum produces a chemical compound called sorgoleone, which the plant uses to combat weeds.

To address this problem, researchers at the Agricultural Research Service found two gene sequences believed to be responsible for the enzymes that secrete the chemical compound sorogoleone. The discovery of these gene sequences will help researchers one day in developing sorghum varieties that cause less soil toxicity and potentially target gene sequences in other crops to increase their natural pesticide capabilities, as well.",

This technique analyzes the metabolic pathway of a microorganism, and determines the constraints and their effects on the production of desired compounds. It then uses genetic engineering to relieve these constraints. Some examples of successful metabolic engineering are the following: (i) Identification of constraints to lysine production in \"Corynebacterium\" \"glutamicum\" and insertion of new genes to relieve these constraints to improve production (ii) Engineering of a new fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, called reversed beta oxidation pathway, that is more efficient than the native pathway in producing fatty acids and alcohols which can potentially be catalytically converted to chemicals and fuels (iii) Improved production of DAHP an aromatic metabolite produced by \"E. coli\" that is an intermediate in the production of aromatic amino acids. It was determined through metabolic flux analysis that the theoretical maximal yield of DAHP per glucose molecule utilized, was 3/7. This is because some of the carbon from glucose is lost as carbon dioxide, instead of being utilized to produce DAHP. Also, one of the metabolites (PEP, or phosphoenolpyruvate) that are used to produce DAHP, was being converted to pyruvate (PYR) to transport glucose into the cell, and therefore, was no longer available to produce DAHP. In order to relieve the shortage of PEP and increase yield, Patnaik et al. used genetic engineering on \"E. coli\" to introduce a reaction that converts PYR back to PEP. Thus, the PEP used to transport glucose into the cell is regenerated, and can be used to make DAHP. This resulted in a new theoretical maximal yield of 6/7 \u2013 double that of the native \"E. coli\" system.",

Most other animals are able to produce this compound in their bodies and do not require it in their diets.

In other cells, it is maintained in its reduced form by reaction with glutathione, which can be catalysed by protein disulfide isomerase and glutaredoxins. Ascorbic acid is a redox catalyst which can reduce, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. In addition to its direct antioxidant effects, ascorbic acid is also a substrate for the redox enzyme ascorbate peroxidase, a function that is particularly important in stress resistance in plants.

Secondary metabolism produces a large number of specialized compounds (estimated 200,000) that do not aid in the growth and development of plants but are required for the plant to survive in its environment. Secondary metabolism is connected to primary metabolism by using building blocks and biosynthetic enzymes derived from primary metabolism. Primary metabolism governs all basic physiological processes that allow a plant to grow and set seeds, by translating the genetic code into proteins, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Specialized compounds from secondary metabolism are essential for communicating with other organisms in mutualistic (e.g. attraction of beneficial organisms such as pollinators) or antagonistic interactions (e.g. deterrent against herbivores and pathogens). They further assist in coping with abiotic stress such as increased UV-radiation. The broad functional spectrum of specialized metabolism is still not fully understood. In any case, a good balance between products of primary and secondary metabolism is best for a plant\u2019s optimal growth and development as well as for its effective coping with often changing environmental conditions.

In that year, it was announced that researchers had managed to completely oxidize methanol using a series (or \u201ccascade\u201d) of enzymes in a biofuel cell. Previous to this time, the enzyme catalysts had failed to completely oxidize the cell\u2019s fuel, delivering far lower amounts of energy than what was expected given what was known about the energy capacity of the fuel. While methanol is now far less relevant in this field as a fuel, the demonstrated method of using a series of enzymes to completely oxidize the cell\u2019s fuel gave researchers a way forward, and much work is now devoted to using similar methods to achieve complete oxidation of more complicated compounds, such as glucose. In addition, and perhaps what is more important, 1998 was the year in which enzyme \u201cimmobilization\u201d was successfully demonstrated, which increased the usable life of the methanol fuel cell from just eight hours to over a week. Immobilization also provided researchers with the ability to put earlier discoveries into practice, in particular the discovery of enzymes that can be used to directly transfer electrons from the enzyme to the electrode. This process had been understood since the 1980s but depended heavily on placing the enzyme as close to the electrode as possible, which meant that it was unusable until after immobilization techniques were devised.  In addition, developers of enzymatic biofuel cells have applied some of the advances in nanotechnology to their designs, including the use of carbon nanotubes to immobilize enzymes directly. Other research has gone into exploiting some of the strengths of the enzymatic design to dramatically miniaturize the fuel cells, a process that must occur if these cells are ever to be used with implantable devices. One research team took advantage of the extreme selectivity of the enzymes to completely remove the barrier between anode and cathode, which is an absolute requirement in fuel cells not of the enzymatic type. This allowed the team to produce a fuel cell that produces 1.1 microwatts operating at over half a volt in a space of just 0.01 cubic millimeters.",

It is also involved in the production of serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine \u2013 neurotransmitters that transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. THB deficiency can be caused by mutations in one of several genes, including GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR. These genes control the production of hydroxylase enzymes that are critical for producing and recycling THB. If just one of the enzymes fails to function correctly because of a gene mutation, little or no BH4 is produced. As a result, phenylalanine from the diet builds up in the bloodstream and other tissues, potentially damaging nerve cells in the brain. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency also disrupts the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which affects the function of the central nervous system (CNS), and dysregulation of the nitric oxide cycle leads to a buildup of peroxynitrite, an inflammatory oxidant that further degrades BH4 and perpetuates a state of inflammation. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can be caused by a deficiency of the enzyme dihydrobiopterin reductase (DHPR), whose activity is needed to replenish quinonoid-dihydrobiopterin back into its tetrahydrobiopterin form. Those with this deficiency may produce sufficient levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) but, since tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for PAH activity, deficient dihydrobiopterin reductase renders any PAH produced unable to use phenylalanine to produce tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor in the production of L-DOPA from tyrosine and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan from tryptophan, which must be supplemented as treatment in addition to the supplements for classical PKU.",
