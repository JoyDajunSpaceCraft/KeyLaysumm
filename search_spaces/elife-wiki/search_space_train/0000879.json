In normal iron regulation, iron is absorbed in the intestine, and ferroportin transports iron from the cells of the intestinal lining into the bloodstream. Iron in the bloodstream is then bound by transferrin, which carries the iron to target cells. Iron is stored in cells and blood serum in a protein called ferritin. Reticuloendothelial macrophages, which can phagocytose red blood cells, are important in the iron recycling process. Ferroportin is upregulated in the reticuloendothelial macrophages after phagocytosis occurs so that iron from the degraded red blood cells can be released into the bloodstream and transported to other types of cells as needed. Hepcidin, a protein synthesized in the liver in response to iron or inflammation, is a regulator of ferroportin expression. When hepcidin binds ferroportin, ferroportin is phosphorylated, endocytosed, tagged with ubiquitin, and degraded. More than 39 mutations to the SLC40A1 gene have been identified in patients with type 4 hemochromatosis. The misregulation of ferroportin in type 4 hemochromatosis can involve a failure of ferroportin to be properly expressed at the cell membrane, or it can involve a failure of ferroportin to respond to negative regulation by hepcidin.",

A working model describes the defect in the HFE gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE is only part of the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.",

The serial analyses of \u03b2-thalassemic mice indicate hemoglobin levels decreases over time, while the concentration of iron in the liver, spleen, and kidneys markedly increases. The overload of iron is associated with low levels of hepcidin. Patients with \u03b2-thalassemia also have low hepcidin levels. The observations led researchers to hypothesize that more iron is absorbed in \u03b2-thalassemia than is required for erythropoiesis. Increasing expression of hepcidin in \u03b2-thalassemic mice limits iron overload, and also decreases formation of insoluble membrane-bound globins and reactive oxygen species, and improves anemia. Mice with increased hepcidin expression also demonstrated an increase in the lifespan of their red cells, reversal of ineffective erythropoiesis and splenomegaly, and an increase in total hemoglobin levels. From these data, researchers suggested that therapeutics to increase hepcidin levels or act as hepcidin agonists could help treat the abnormal iron absorption in individuals with \u03b2-thalassemia and related disorders.

Protein is an essential component in any dog's diet. \u00a0Muscle, hair, skin, ligaments, cartilage, and chest and abdomen organs are structurally supported by protein. In comparison to the average dog, a performance or sporting dog requires a greater protein intake. This is a result of wear and tear on muscles and other organ tissues caused by strenuous activity. Protein is also a vital component in bodily functions such as transporting oxygen and energy to the muscles, regulating blood glucose levels, fighting infections, and repairing tissues. Many diets targeted for performance dogs contain 30% protein. However, dogs performing in different athletic activities can require varying amounts of protein and essential amino acids. For instance, studies have shown that sled dogs require a high protein, high fat diet, where 30 to 40% of energy comes from protein and 50% of energy comes from fat. Greyhounds were found to require a moderate protein (25% energy) and moderately high fat (30-50% energy) diet. At present there are conflicting opinions concerning whether protein from animal sources is of higher quality than protein from non animal sources. For instance, a study completed by Brown et al., concluded that \"In a 16-week controlled experiment, a meat-free diet maintained haematological characteristics in sprint-racing sled dogs (Siberian huskies)\". No deficiencies or side effects were noted in this study. However, in previous studies it was discovered that when feeding non animal protein diets to performance dogs, a larger prevalence of anemia was found in comparison to when dogs were fed diets containing animal protein. Poor iron bioavailability can lead to anemia. As stated by Chausow and Czarnecki-Maulden, it is generally accepted that animal sources of protein have more iron bioavailability than plant sources. Studies have been conducted to compare iron bioavailability when feeding animal and non animal sources of protein. However, research on dogs for this topic is are lacking. Studies completed by Chausow and Czarnecki-Maulden conclude that more research needs to be done on iron bioavailability of plant and animal protein sources.

Starting during the Mesolithic Era, communities of people lived in an environment that was fairly sunny, warm and had the dry climates of the Middle East. Most of the humans who lived at the time were foragers and their diets consisted mostly of hunting game, gathering and even fishing when and if the opportunity arose. With the archaeologists studying dental plaque and the assumptions of what would have been available to the people due to their environment, leads to the theories of Mesolithic foragers eating substances such as tubers, nuts, plantains, grass and much of the food would have been was very rich in iron. Over hundreds of years the body was very well adapted to the high level of iron content in the consumption. Moving forward in time and studying the Neolithic Era, which was during the end of the Stone Age, we see serious advancements in both the environment and diet of the travelling people. During the European Neolithic era, some communities of foragers started to migrate north. The lifestyle and environment started to change to a decrease in temperatures and a change in the landscaping in which the foragers now needed to adapt to. As the people began to develop and advance their use of tools and learn new ways of producing food, hunting and gathering was no longer the main source, but farming also slowly started to develop. The change that the travellers encountered would have lead to serious stress on the body and a decrease in iron rich consumption. This transition is a key factor in which researchers can start to see the link between the travellers diets, environment & the mutations of genes, especially those that regulated the iron absorption within the body. The iron, that makes of 70% of our red blood cell composition, \u00a0is a critical micronutrient for effective thermoregulation in the body. When the body encounters a deficiency of its micronutrients, in this case iron, it will lead to a drop in the core temperature. When the travellers encountered the much more chilly & damp environments of Europe, the supplementary iron from there food was a necessity to help keep their temperatures regulated- however, without the iron supplements from the food the human body would have undergone serious stress to make up for the lost iron and would have started to store iron at higher rates than normal. This theory hypothesizes that the pressures cause by the migration would be the initiation to the gene mutation that allowed the body to absorb & store higher amounts of iron. There is no way to know the exact time at which the gene mutated or in which location these people were in when it happened. However, when the time frame at which the migrators would have started to move north and the increasing probability of the people\u2019s bodies adapting, lead to the assumption that the travellers would have moved and helped to develop the Celtic Empire during the Bronzing Age. This theory would also offer an explanation of why the name \u2018Celtic Curse\u2019 became a well known alternative/nickname for hemochromatosis.",

The overload of iron is associated with low levels of hepcidin. Patients with \u03b2-thalassemia also have low hepcidin levels.

As APP does not possess ferroxidase activity within its E2 domain, the mechanism of APP-modulated iron efflux from ferroportin has come under scrutiny. One model suggests that APP acts to stabilize the iron efflux protein ferroportin in the plasma membrane of cells thereby increasing the total number of ferroportin molecules at the membrane. These iron-transporters can then be activated by known mammalian ferroxidases (i.e. ceruloplasmin or hephaestin).",

Measurement of serum ferritin indicates for total body iron overload. Liver biopsy measures the iron concentration of liver. It provides the microscopic examination of the liver. Measurement of serum hepcidin levels may be useful in diagnostic for iron overload. MRI can detect the degree of magnetic disruption due to iron accumulation. MRI can measure iron accumulation within the heart, liver, and pituitary. Accumulation of iron in a single organ does not provide proper representation of the total body iron overload.",

Hemochromatosis type 4, also known as ferroportin disease, is a hereditary iron overload disorder that affects ferroportin, an iron transport protein needed to export iron from cells into circulation. Although the disease is rare, it is found throughout the world and affects people from various ethnic groups. While the majority of individuals with type 4 hemochromatosis have a relatively mild form of the disease, some affected individuals have a more severe form. As the disease progresses, iron may accumulate in the tissues of affected individuals over time, potentially resulting in organ damage.",

            "document": "HFE hereditary haemochromatosis . Since the regulation of iron metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the HFE gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE is only part of the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.",

Since the liver produces hepcidin in response to inflammatory cytokines, hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of anemia of chronic disease, in which not enough iron is available to produce enough hemoglobin-containing red blood cells.",

The loss of function mutation results in a phenotype that is different from that of a gain of function mutation, and these phenotypes are associated with two different forms of type 4 hemochromatosis. Loss-of-function mutations are more frequent and are associated with type 4A hemochromatosis. These mutations lead to a defect in the localization of ferroportin. Gain-of-function mutations are associated with type 4B and lead to production of ferroportin that resists negative regulation by hepcidin.",
