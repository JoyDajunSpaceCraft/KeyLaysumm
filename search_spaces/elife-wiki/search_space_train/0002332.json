The genus \"Loxodonta\" was named by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier in 1825. Cuvier spelled it \"Loxodonte,\" but in 1827 an anonymous author romanised the spelling to \"Loxodonta\"; the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature recognises this as the proper authority. In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but further morphological data has reduced the number of classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant (\"L.\u00a0a.\u00a0africana\") and the forest elephant (\"L.\u00a0a.\u00a0cyclotis\"), the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist Paul Matschie. Forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants, and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and Central Africa. A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species (\"L.\u00a0africana\" and \"L.\u00a0cyclotis\" respectively) based on differences in skull morphology. DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that they were the same species. Further studies (2010, 2011, 2015) have supported African savannah and forest elephants' status as separate species. The two species are believed to have diverged 6 million years ago. and have been completely genetically isolated for the past 500,000 years. In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that \"L. cyclotis\" is more closely related to the extinct \"Palaeoloxodon antiquus\", than it is to \"L. africana,\" possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole. Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species, although this is disputed.

Each of these schistosomes, that are part of the genus \"Bivitellobilharzia\", sit near the base of a branch within the schistosome family that contains mammal-infecting species. This is a fairly new identified endoparasite that was found in 1955 by Mudaliar and Ramanujachari, who first recorded the parasite in India. Researchers collected fecal samples of the Indian rhinoceros and were startled to find \"B. nairi\" eggs.  The morphological characteristics of the egg are a spindle shape with a terminal spine The eggs are characteristically similar to \"schistosome\" eggs. They also share a distinct similarity with the eggs of the elephant blood fluke. Researchers sequenced specific sections of the fluke egg's DNA and found that the elephant blood fluke and the rhinoceros blook fluke matched sequences with each other. This can tell us that both species are hosts to the same parasites. The elephant schistosome is able to infect the Indian Rhinoceros. Elephants and Indian Rhinoceros must share the same physiological structures to be infected by the same \"B. nairi\" parasite. They also share the same habitat making transmission from one animal to next fairly easy.  \"Bivitellobilharzia nairi\", common name the elephant schistosome, is a parasitic trematode that uses the Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\") as a definitive host. Two other hosts may be the Indian elephant and the greater one-horned rhinoceros Once the elephant is infected, it releases schistosome eggs in the feces near a fresh water habitat where it infects the intermediate host, snails. The cercariae larval stage of the parasite will be released into freshwater and become free-swimming parasites to then penetrate the hosts' skin. Once inside the mammal the cercariae will loose its tail during infection and pair with an adult worm to sexually reproduce. Eggs produced in host will be passed in feces to then be deposited in freshwater once again and release the miracidia within. The miracidia will then penetrate the snail host tissue. These freshwater snails have been confirmed to be intermediate hosts. So far two intermediate snail genus have been identified; \"Indoplanorbis exustus\" and \"Lymnaea luteola\".",

The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events. In the modern era, elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo (1861 \u2013 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus. These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals. As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans. Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.",

In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but further morphological data has reduced the number of classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant (\"L.\u00a0a.\u00a0africana\") and the forest elephant (\"L.\u00a0a.\u00a0cyclotis\"), the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist Paul Matschie.

This fragmentation means that recovery of a full extinct genome is largely impossible. Thus, only partial genes can be utilized and the most viable method is to use a close evolutionary relative of the extinct species and insert the genes that differ into an embryo of the living species. For mammoth de-extinction, any trait consideration would involve the Asian elephant, the closest still-living relative. Using genes from extrapolated mammoth DNA, the Asian elephant could be made to survive across a wider range, including cold environments, protecting it against possible extinction.

Two methods have been proposed to achieve this. The first is cloning, which would involve removal of the DNA-containing nucleus of the egg cell of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and inserted back into a female elephant. The resulting calf would have the genes of the woolly mammoth, although its fetal environment would be different. To date, even the most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough to guide the production of an embryo. The second method involves artificially inseminating an elephant egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring would be an elephant\u2013mammoth hybrid, and the process would have to be repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are potent for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old. In 2008, a Japanese team found usable DNA in the brains of mice that had been frozen for 16 years. They hope to use similar methods to find usable mammoth DNA.

The first woolly mammoth remains studied by European scientists were examined by Hans Sloane in 1728 and consisted of fossilised teeth and tusks from Siberia. Sloane was the first to recognise that the remains belonged to elephants. Sloane turned to another biblical explanation for the presence of elephants in the Arctic, asserting that they had been buried during the Great Flood, and that Siberia had previously been tropical before a drastic climate change. Others interpreted Sloane's conclusion slightly differently, arguing the flood had carried elephants from the Tropics to the Arctic. Sloane's paper was based on travellers' descriptions and a few scattered bones collected in Siberia and Britain. He discussed the question of whether or not the remains were from elephants, but drew no conclusions. In 1738, the German zoologist Johann Philipp Breyne argued that mammoth fossils represented some kind of elephant. He could not explain why a tropical animal would be found in such a cold area as Siberia, and suggested that they might have been transported there by the Great Flood. In 1796, the French anatomist Georges Cuvier was the first to identify the woolly mammoth remains not as modern elephants transported to the Arctic, but as an entirely new species.

However recent DNA research has revealed that most likely, Ptolemy's elephants were in fact \"Loxodonta africana\", albeit culled from a population of more diminutive African bush elephants still found in Eritrea today. Another possibility is that Ptolemy utilized the now extinct North African elephants (Loxodonta africana pharaoensis). Much smaller than their Indian or Bush cousins, members of this subspecies were typically around 8 foot high at the shoulder. Regardless of origin, according to Polybius, Ptolemy's African elephants could not bear the smell, sound, and sight of their Indian counterparts. The Indian's greater size and strength easily routed the Africans.",

            "document": "Ivory carving . Ivory is by no means just obtained from elephants; any animal tooth or tusk used as a material for carving may be termed \"ivory\", though the species is usually added, and a great number of different species with tusks or large teeth have been used. Teeth have three elements: the outer dental enamel, then the main body of dentine, and the inner root of osteo-dentine. For the purposes of carving the last two are in most animals both usable, but the harder enamel may be too hard to carve, and require removal by grinding first. This is the case with hippopotamus for example, whose tooth enamel (on the largest teeth) is about as hard as jade. Elephant ivory, as well as coming in the largest pieces, is relatively soft and even, and an ideal material for carving. The species of animal from which ivory comes can usually be determined by examination under ultra-violet light, where different types show different colours. Eurasian elephant ivory was usually obtained from the tusks of elephants in India, and in Roman times, from North Africa; from the 18th century sub-Saharan Africa became the main source. Ivory harvesting led to the extinction, or near-extinction of elephants in much of their former range. In early medieval Northern Europe, walrus ivory was traded south from as far away as Norse Greenland to Scandinavia, southern England and northern France and Germany. In Siberia and Arctic North America, mammoth tusks could be recovered from permafrost and used; this became a large business in the 19th century, with convicts used for much of the labour. The 25,000-year-old Venus of Brassempouy, arguably the earliest real likeness of a human face, was carved from mammoth ivory no doubt freshly killed. In northern Europe during the Early Middle Ages walrus ivory was more easily obtained from Viking traders, and later Norse settlements in Greenland than elephant ivory from the south; at this time walrus were probably found much further south than they are today. Sperm whale teeth are another source, and bone carving has been used in many cultures without access to ivory, and as a far cheaper alternative; in the Middle Ages whalebone was often used, either from the Basque whaling industry or natural strandings.",

It is most closely related to the blood fluke \"Bivitellobilharzia loxodontae\", which uses African forest elephants (\"Loxodonta cyclotis\") as a definitive host. Each of these schistosomes, that are part of the genus \"Bivitellobilharzia\", sit near the base of a branch within the schistosome family that contains mammal-infecting species. This is a fairly new identified endoparasite that was found in 1955 by Mudaliar and Ramanujachari, who first recorded the parasite in India. Researchers collected fecal samples of the Indian rhinoceros and were startled to find \"B. nairi\" eggs.  The morphological characteristics of the egg are a spindle shape with a terminal spine The eggs are characteristically similar to \"schistosome\" eggs. They also share a distinct similarity with the eggs of the elephant blood fluke. Researchers sequenced specific sections of the fluke egg's DNA and found that the elephant blood fluke and the rhinoceros blook fluke matched sequences with each other. This can tell us that both species are hosts to the same parasites. The elephant schistosome is able to infect the Indian Rhinoceros. Elephants and Indian Rhinoceros must share the same physiological structures to be infected by the same \"B. nairi\" parasite. They also share the same habitat making transmission from one animal to next fairly easy.  \"Bivitellobilharzia nairi\", common name the elephant schistosome, is a parasitic trematode that uses the Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\") as a definitive host. Two other hosts may be the Indian elephant and the greater one-horned rhinoceros Once the elephant is infected, it releases schistosome eggs in the feces near a fresh water habitat where it infects the intermediate host, snails. The cercariae larval stage of the parasite will be released into freshwater and become free-swimming parasites to then penetrate the hosts' skin. Once inside the mammal the cercariae will loose its tail during infection and pair with an adult worm to sexually reproduce. Eggs produced in host will be passed in feces to then be deposited in freshwater once again and release the miracidia within. The miracidia will then penetrate the snail host tissue. These freshwater snails have been confirmed to be intermediate hosts. So far two intermediate snail genus have been identified; \"Indoplanorbis exustus\" and \"Lymnaea luteola\".",

The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events. In the modern era, elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo (1861 \u2013 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus. These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals. As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans. Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.",
