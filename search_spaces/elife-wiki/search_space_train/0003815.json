The proton symport proteins in the membrane take in the amino acid coupled with a hydrogen ion that later gets expelled by the cell via a hydrogen ion pump. This is an energy dependent process that becomes more energetically unfavorable for the yeast cell as fermentation progressed and ethanol levels increase, creating \"passive leakage\" of excess hydrogen ions into the cell. The cell's hydrogen ion pumps have to work even harder to maintain its internal pH so it sends a signal to the symport proteins to stop bringing other ions. This is one of the reasons why late fermentation nitrogen additions have little to no effective as the transport mechanisms of the nitrogen into the cell are shut down.",

Like all anion exchangers, the resin carries a positive charge that interacts favorably with negative charges. The positive charge of DEAE cellulose is due to a protonated amine group. To ensure that the resin is protonated and positively charged, the chromatography should be performed at least 2 pH units below the pKa of the amine group, 10. The strength of the bond between the resin and protein is highly dependent on the pH range in the column and the pI of the protein of interest. The resin is a weak exchanger because it is only partially ionized over most pH values, and an efficient separation with DEAE-C chromatography requires a specific, narrow pH range. Elution of a protein of interest is accomplished by increasing the salt concentration in the column or any means of adding ions that compete for binding to the tertiary amine. NaCl or KCl are typically used because the chloride anions will attach to the resin and displace the protein, allowing the protein to proceed through the column. Adding a suitable buffer may bring the pH close to or below the pI, which causes the protein to lose its negative charges that interact with the resin, thus eluting the molecule from the column.",

Ion chromatography (or ion-exchange chromatography) is a chromatography process that separates ions and polar molecules based on their affinity to the ion exchanger. It works on almost any kind of charged molecule\u2014including large proteins, small nucleotides, and amino acids. However, ion chromatography must be done in conditions that are one unit away from the isoelectric point of a protein. The two types of ion chromatography are anion-exchange and cation-exchange. Cation-exchange chromatography is used when the molecule of interest is positively charged. The molecule is positively charged because the pH for chromatography is less than the pI. In this type of chromatography, the stationary phase is negatively charged and positively charged molecules are loaded to be attracted to it. Anion-exchange chromatography is when the stationary phase is positively charged and negatively charged molecules (meaning that pH for chromatography is greater than the pI) are loaded to be attracted to it. It is often used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control. The water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, amino acids, and peptides bind to moieties which are oppositely charged by forming ionic bonds to the insoluble stationary phase. The equilibrated stationary phase consists of an ionizable functional group where the targeted molecules of a mixture to be separated and quantified can bind while passing through the column\u2014a cationic stationary phase is used to separate anions and an anionic stationary phase is used to separate cations. Cation exchange chromatography is used when the desired molecules to separate are cations and anion exchange chromatography is used to separate anions. The bound molecules then can be eluted and collected using an eluant which contains anions and cations by running higher concentration of ions through the column or changing pH of the column. One of the primary advantages for the use of ion chromatography is only one interaction involved during the separation as opposed to other separation techniques; therefore, ion chromatography may have higher matrix tolerance. Another advantage of ion exchange, is the predictably of elution patterns (based on the presence of the ionizable group). For example, when cation exchange chromatography is used, cations will elute out last. Meanwhile, the negative charged molecules will elute out first. However, there are also disadvantages involved when performing ion-exchange chromatography, such as constant evolution with the technique which leads to the inconsistency from column to column. A major limitation to this purification technique is that it is limited to ionizable group.",

Gelation can be defined as protein aggregation phenomenon in which polymer-polymer and polymer-solvent interaction are so balanced that a tertiary network of matrix is. Coagulation is protein aggregation in which polymer-polymer interaction are favored resulting in a less elastic, less hydrated structure than a protein gel. The gel formation characteristic of tofu consists of the following two steps: an irreversible step which is (1) protein denaturation induced by heat and (2) acid or salt coagulation. Heat induced denaturation results in the disruption of the secondary and tertiary structure of the soy proteins. Now that the soy proteins are unfolded, the hydrophobic regions that are initially located inside the protein are exposed to the outside medium. In the second step, the exposed negatively charged acidic side chains residues (-COOH) present on glutamic and aspartic acid amino acid are protonated by the addition of coagulant. The addition of acid or ions neutralizes the surface charge of the exposed side chains. As a result, the electrostatic repulsion between protein molecules are decreased and hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals forces dominate and the now neutralized protein molecule becomes the predominant structure. Due to charge dispersion and decrease electrostatic repulsion, the particles can come closer together and aggregation occur via hydrophobic interactions causing the proteins aggregate to form a three dimensional protein network entrapping water and other components.",

In passive acidification, it has been proposed that cell walls contain acidic polymers composed of residues such as galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phosphoric acid. Together, these residues form an acidic matrix that helps protect the plasma membrane from alkaline conditions by preventing the entry of hydroxide ions, and allowing for the uptake of sodium and hydronium ions. In addition, the peptidoglycan in alkaliphilic \"B. subtilis\" has been observed to contain higher levels of hexosamines and amino acids as compared to its neutrophilic counterpart. When alkaliphiles lose these acidic residues in the form of induced mutations, it has been shown that their ability to grow in alkaline conditions is severely hindered.  However, it is generally agreed upon that passive methods of cytosolic acidification are not sufficient to maintain an internal pH 2-2.3 levels below that of external pH; there must also be active forms of acidification. The most characterized method of active acidification is in the form of Na+/H+ antiporters. In this model, H+ ions are first extruded through the electron transport chain in respiring cells and to some extent through an ATPase in fermentative cells. This proton extrusion establishes a proton gradient that drives electrogenic antiporters\u2014which drive intracellular Na+ out of the cell in exchange for a greater number of H+ ions, leading to the net accumulation of internal protons. This proton accumulation leads to a lowering of cytosolic pH. The extruded Na+ can be used for solute symport, which are necessary for cellular processes. It has been noted that Na+/H+ antiport is required for alkaliphilic growth, whereas either K+/H+ antiporters or Na+/H+ antiporters can be utilized by neutrophilic bacteria. If Na+/H+ antiporters are disabled through mutation or another means, the bacteria are rendered neutrophilic.

In passive acidification, it has been proposed that cell walls contain acidic polymers composed of residues such as galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phosphoric acid. Together, these residues form an acidic matrix that helps protect the plasma membrane from alkaline conditions by preventing the entry of hydroxide ions, and allowing for the uptake of sodium and hydronium ions. In addition, the peptidoglycan in alkaliphilic \"B. subtilis\" has been observed to contain higher levels of hexosamines and amino acids as compared to its neutrophilic counterpart. When alkaliphiles lose these acidic residues in the form of induced mutations, it has been shown that their ability to grow in alkaline conditions is severely hindered.  However, it is generally agreed upon that passive methods of cytosolic acidification are not sufficient to maintain an internal pH 2-2.3 levels below that of external pH; there must also be active forms of acidification. The most characterized method of active acidification is in the form of Na+/H+ antiporters. In this model, H+ ions are first extruded through the electron transport chain in respiring cells and to some extent through an ATPase in fermentative cells. This proton extrusion establishes a proton gradient that drives electrogenic antiporters\u2014which drive intracellular Na+ out of the cell in exchange for a greater number of H+ ions, leading to the net accumulation of internal protons. This proton accumulation leads to a lowering of cytosolic pH. The extruded Na+ can be used for solute symport, which are necessary for cellular processes. It has been noted that Na+/H+ antiport is required for alkaliphilic growth, whereas either K+/H+ antiporters or Na+/H+ antiporters can be utilized by neutrophilic bacteria. If Na+/H+ antiporters are disabled through mutation or another means, the bacteria are rendered neutrophilic.

This antiporter imports cystine and exports glutamate, which are both amino acids. An antiporter functions with a one-to-one counter-transport, which is when one substance is transported across the membrane at the same time another substance is transported across the membrane in the opposite direction. The antiporter is a heterodimeric amino acid transporter. The structure of this protein includes a specific light chain, xCT, and a heavy chain, 4F2, which are linked by a disulfide bridge. The xCT chain has 12 transmembrane domains consisting of 501 amino acids, and the 4F2 chain appears to be highly conserved among transporters. The human xCT has an 89% similarity of amino acids to a mouse xCT. The complementary DNA, cDNA, has a total of 9648 base pairs. The SLC7A11 gene has been found not only in the brain, but has also been found to be expressed in the spinal cord, pancreas, and in glioma cells.",

The symporter works in the plasma membrane and molecules are transported across the cell membrane at the same time, and is, therefore, a type of cotransporter. The transporter is called a symporter, because the molecules will travel in the same direction in relation to each other. This is in contrast to the antiport transporter. Typically, the ion(s) will move down the electrochemical gradient, allowing the other molecule(s) to move against the concentration gradient. The movement of the ion(s) across the membrane is facilitated diffusion, and is coupled with the active transport of the molecule(s).",

As with other regions, tubule cells in the distal convoluted tubule possess the ATP-powered sodium-potassium antiporter (Na/K-ATPase), which uses energy from ATP to transfer three sodium ions out from the basolateral surface (toward blood vessels) while simultaneously transferring two potassium ions in. The distal convoluted tubule cells also possess a sodium-chloride symporter on the apical side, which passively allows one sodium ion and one chloride ion to diffuse together in from the lumen (where urine is forming) into the cell interior. As sodium is pumped out of the cell by the ATPase, its intracellular concentration falls, and additional sodium begins to diffuse in from the tubule lumen as replacement. The symporter requires chloride to be transported in as well. Water passively follows to maintain isotonicity; excess chloride and potassium passively diffuse out the cell through basolateral channels into the interstitial space, and water accompanies them. The water and chloride, as well as the sodium pumped out by the ATPase, will be absorbed into the bloodstream.",

Even when cultured in a Fe deficient medium, MTB succeed at accumulating high intracellular concentrations of this ion. It has been suggested that they accomplish this by secreting, upon need, a siderophore, a low-molecular-weight ligand displaying an elevated affinity for Fe ions. The \"Fe-siderophore\" complex is subsequently moved in the cytoplasm, where it is cleaved. The ferric ions must then be converted into the ferrous form (Fe), to be accumulated within the BMP; this is achieved by means of a transmembrane transporter, which exhibits sequence homology with a Na/H antiporter. Furthermore, the complex is a H/Fe antiporter, which transports ions via the proton gradient. These transmembrane transporters are localised both in the cytoplasmic membrane and in the MM, but in an inverted orientation; this configuration allows them to generate an efflux of Fe ions at the cytoplasmic membrane, and an influx of this same ion at the MM. This step is strictly controlled by a cytochrome-dependent redox system, which is not yet fully explained and appears to be species-specific.",

While the activity of this enzyme varies across seasons and the mating habits of the newt, the exact role this enzyme plays is not particularly well understood. From the experiment performed by Dore et al., it was observed that the alkaline phosphatase activity was reduced in the transport of two anti-diuretic hormones, prolactin and arginine-vasotocin. It was also noted that the activity of alkaline phosphatase decreased, due in part to hypophysectomy. In summer, aldosterone creates an increase in enzymatic activity (Lodi et al. 1995). Because of this increase in activity, there is a decrease in ion transport, which ties into the activity of ion transport during the aquatic phase. This is likely due to the lowering of bodily functions. Of course, there is an involvement of APH activity in the mechanisms involved in ion transport across the epithelial membrane, also called the cutaneous epithelium. Epithelial cells undergo frequent renewal, and this, in combination with the processes that lead to the rapid regulation of membrane transport, will lead to the said regulation. The APH molecule, in short, plays a large role in the ion exchange across the membrane between the internal and external environments (Lodi et al. 1995). Aldosterone, will independently cause an increase in Na+ channels within the cutaneous membrane. The ion transport is a direct result of coordination and cooperation of both MR cells and the principal cells; for instance, a main role of the mitochondria-rich cells is to energize sodium absorption through use of the principal cells.",
