Lipid droplets, also referred to as lipid bodies, oil bodies or adiposomes, are lipid-rich cellular organelles that regulate the storage and hydrolysis of neutral lipids and are found largely in the adipose tissue. They also serve as a reservoir for cholesterol and acyl-glycerols for membrane formation and maintenance. Lipid droplets are found in all eukaryotic organisms and store a large portion of lipids in mammalian adipocytes. Initially, these lipid droplets were considered to merely serve as fat depots, but since the discovery in the 1990s of proteins in the lipid droplet coat that regulate lipid droplet dynamics and lipid metabolism, lipid droplets are seen as highly dynamic organelles that play a very important role in the regulation of intracellular lipid storage and lipid metabolism. The role of lipid droplets outside of lipid and cholesterol storage has recently begun to be elucidated and includes a close association to inflammatory responses through the synthesis and metabolism of eicosanoids and to metabolic disorders such as obesity, cancer, and atherosclerosis. In non-adipocytes, lipid droplets are known to play a role in protection from lipotoxicity by storage of fatty acids in the form of neutral triacylglycerol, which consists of three fatty acids bound to glycerol. Alternatively, fatty acids can be converted to lipid intermediates like diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramides and fatty acyl-CoAs. These lipid intermediates can impair insulin signaling, which is referred to as lipid-induced insulin resistance and lipotoxicity. Lipid droplets also serve as platforms for protein binding and degradation. Finally, lipid droplets are known to be exploited by pathogens such as the hepatitis C virus, the dengue virus and \"chlamydia trachomatis\" among others.",

These fats are obtained from consuming food and absorbing them or they are synthesized by an animal's liver. Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing these fats. The majority of lipids found in the human body from ingesting food are triglycerides and cholesterol. Other types of lipids found in the body are fatty acids and membrane Lipids. Lipid metabolism is often considered the digestion and absorption process of dietary fat; however, there are two ways organisms can use fats to obtain energy: consumed dietary fats and storage fat. Vertebrates and humans use both methods of fat usage as their sources of energy for organs such as the heart to function. Since lipids are hydrophobic molecules, they need to be solubilized before their metabolism begin. Lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis, which occurs with the help of various enzymes in the digestive system. Lipid metabolism does exist in plants, though the processes differ in some ways when compared to animals. The second step after the hydrolysis is the absorption of the fatty acids into the epithelial cells of the intestinal wall. In the epithelial cells, fatty acids are packaged and transported to the rest of the body.",

In addition to blood cells, PLSCR3 is expressed to a significantly higher level in fat and muscle cells, which are actively involved in fat metabolism. PLSCR3 knockout mice showed an aberrant abdominal fat accumulation, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and dyslipidema as compared to controlled mice. Cultured fat cells from PLSCR3 knockout mice were engorged with neutral lipids. Blood plasma of these mice showed elevated levels of non-high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, and leptin, but low adiponectin content. Abdominal fat accumulation with the formation of enlarged lipid engorged adipocytes has emerged as the key risk factor for the onset of type 2 diabetes, which is often a manifestation of a broader underlying metabolic disorder termed as metabolic syndrome. Further studies on the regulation of lipid metabolism by PLSCRs are required to understand the risk for development of similar diseases in humans when PLSCR genes are mutated, leading to a defective expression and/or function of PLSCR proteins.",

In mammals, FITM2 protein is made up of 262 amino acids (while FIT1 part of the same family is 292 amino acids long) and has six transmembrane domains in which the N and C termini are both geared to face the cytosol. When FITM2 has a mutation in its fourth transmembrane domain that happens to be a gain-of-function one, is found overexpressed in cells, it has unfailingly caused the buildup of TG rich lipid droplets. This mutation has been described as having a significant effect on increasing both the amount and size and lipid droplets. A comparative sequence analysis of FITM2 showed a tract of residues that were deemed as extensively conserved located in this transmembrane 4 that was later named the \u201cFIT signature sequence\u201d. In the cells of mammals, the construction of lipid droplets is a process that is strictly controlled, using hormone induced signals, proteins related to droplets, and lipases as well. Four observations support the role of FIT proteins in the buildup and mediation of lipid droplets. First, they have been conserved throughout evolution and solely found in the ER which is the primary site for the biosynthesis of TGs. Second, when FIT proteins are overexpressed in either the liver of a mouse of even in cells that have been cultured \"in vivo\", there has been observable buildup of lipid droplets that are rich in triglycerides as an outcome. Third, FIT proteins are not DGATs. DGATs facilitate the biosynthesis of the TGs. FIT proteins strictly aid in the conversion of the TGs (made by DGATs) into lipid droplets. Therefore, knowing the function of these FIT proteins helps us to make sense of why they are placed downstream of the DGATs. Lastly, a shRNA-facilitated reduction in FITM2 in adipocytes (3T3-L1) or even a knockdown of it in the embryos of zebrafish resulted in great declines in lipid droplet build-up.",

The accumulation of lipid peroxides that results in the process of ferroptosis makes it peroxidation-driven, meaning it is driven by the oxidative degeneration of lipids. This process of cell death occurs when free radical molecules take electrons from a lipid molecule to cause the degradation of the lipid molecule. This degradation is the result of the lipid molecules being oxidized, meaning losing electrons, to the free radical molecules. This process makes ferroptosis a regulatory form of cell death. The reason the process of oxidative degradation of a lipid drives ferroptosis is because glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a lipid repair enzyme, undergoes a loss of activity. Researchers have identified roles in which ferroptosis can contribute to the medical field such as in aiding in cancer treatments where this form of cell death can be induced in the human body. Ferroptosis activation plays a regulatory role on growth of tumor cells in the human body. However, the positive effects of ferroptosis could be potentially neutralized by its disruption of metabolic pathways and disruption of homeostasis in the human body.

For example, in adipocytes, this has been shown in a variety of experiments with mice: ectopic expression of these C/EBPs (C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b2) were able to initiate the differentiation programs of the cell, even in the absence of adipogenic hormones, or the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes (or fat cells).

However, if enlargement of fat cells and fat tissue causes them to become \"sick\", then important fat tissue functions are disrupted, and deranged responses contribute to metabolic disease. When excessive body weight leads to adiposopathy, this represents a hormone or endocrine disease. Additionally, fat cells and fat tissue also produce many different types of immune factors. Inflammation is a contributing cause to metabolic disease, and the ultimate contribution of fat tissue to inflammation is determined by the production of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. From a pro-inflammatory standpoint, fat tissue (which includes fat cells and other cells, such as immune cells) produces factors including: (1) adipokines with cytokine activity such as leptin, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; (2) acute phase proteins / reactants such as C-reactive protein; (3) adipokines of the alternative complement system; (4) chemotactic/chemoattractant adipokines; and prostaglandins (eicosanoids). From an anti-inflammatory standpoint, fat tissue produces various anti-inflammatory factors with the most commonly described being adiponectin. If fat cells or fat tissue becomes \"sick\", then the release of too many pro-inflammatory factors and a decrease in too many anti-inflammatory factors often result in a net pro-inflammatory response can contribute to metabolic disease.",

When FITM2 has a mutation in its fourth transmembrane domain that happens to be a gain-of-function one, is found overexpressed in cells, it has unfailingly caused the buildup of TG rich lipid droplets. This mutation has been described as having a significant effect on increasing both the amount and size and lipid droplets. A comparative sequence analysis of FITM2 showed a tract of residues that were deemed as extensively conserved located in this transmembrane 4 that was later named the \u201cFIT signature sequence\u201d. In the cells of mammals, the construction of lipid droplets is a process that is strictly controlled, using hormone induced signals, proteins related to droplets, and lipases as well. Four observations support the role of FIT proteins in the buildup and mediation of lipid droplets. First, they have been conserved throughout evolution and solely found in the ER which is the primary site for the biosynthesis of TGs. Second, when FIT proteins are overexpressed in either the liver of a mouse of even in cells that have been cultured \"in vivo\", there has been observable buildup of lipid droplets that are rich in triglycerides as an outcome. Third, FIT proteins are not DGATs. DGATs facilitate the biosynthesis of the TGs. FIT proteins strictly aid in the conversion of the TGs (made by DGATs) into lipid droplets. Therefore, knowing the function of these FIT proteins helps us to make sense of why they are placed downstream of the DGATs. Lastly, a shRNA-facilitated reduction in FITM2 in adipocytes (3T3-L1) or even a knockdown of it in the embryos of zebrafish resulted in great declines in lipid droplet build-up.",

Lipid droplets, also referred to as lipid bodies, oil bodies or adiposomes, are lipid-rich cellular organelles that regulate the storage and hydrolysis of neutral lipids and are found largely in the adipose tissue.

Lipid droplets are found in all eukaryotic organisms and store a large portion of lipids in mammalian adipocytes. Initially, these lipid droplets were considered to merely serve as fat depots, but since the discovery in the 1990s of proteins in the lipid droplet coat that regulate lipid droplet dynamics and lipid metabolism, lipid droplets are seen as highly dynamic organelles that play a very important role in the regulation of intracellular lipid storage and lipid metabolism. The role of lipid droplets outside of lipid and cholesterol storage has recently begun to be elucidated and includes a close association to inflammatory responses through the synthesis and metabolism of eicosanoids and to metabolic disorders such as obesity, cancer, and atherosclerosis. In non-adipocytes, lipid droplets are known to play a role in protection from lipotoxicity by storage of fatty acids in the form of neutral triacylglycerol, which consists of three fatty acids bound to glycerol. Alternatively, fatty acids can be converted to lipid intermediates like diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramides and fatty acyl-CoAs. These lipid intermediates can impair insulin signaling, which is referred to as lipid-induced insulin resistance and lipotoxicity. Lipid droplets also serve as platforms for protein binding and degradation. Finally, lipid droplets are known to be exploited by pathogens such as the hepatitis C virus, the dengue virus and \"chlamydia trachomatis\" among others.",

Vertebrates and humans use both methods of fat usage as their sources of energy for organs such as the heart to function.

Lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis, which occurs with the help of various enzymes in the digestive system.

This degradation is the result of the lipid molecules being oxidized, meaning losing electrons, to the free radical molecules. This process makes ferroptosis a regulatory form of cell death.

Alternatively, seipin can be referred to as Bernardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 protein (BSCL2), and it is encoded by the corresponding gene of the same name, i.e. BSCL2. At protein level, seipin is expressed in cortical neurons in the frontal lobes, as well as motor neurons in the spinal cord. It is highly expressed in areas like the brain, testis and adipose tissue. Seipin's function is still unclear but it has been localized close to lipid droplets, and cells knocked out in seipin which have anomalous droplets. Hence, recent evidence suggests seipin to play a crucial role in lipid droplet biogenesis.",

Although the exact mechanism of formation of lipid droplets is still unknown, it is proposed that they bud off the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum as TAGs are collected between the two layers of its phospholipid membrane. Lipid droplet growth can consequently happen through direct diffusion of fatty acids, endocytosis of sterols or by fusion of smaller lipid droplets through the aid of SNARE proteins. Lipid droplets have also been observed to be created by the fission of existing lipid droplets, though this is thought to be less common than \"de novo\" formation.",

            "document": "Lipolysis . In adipose tissue, intracellular triglycerides are stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. When lipases are phosphorylated, they access lipid droplets and through multiple steps of hydrolysis, breakdown triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. Each step of hydrolysis leads to the removal of one fatty acid. The first step and the rate-limiting step of lipolysis is carried out by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to diacylglycerol. Subsequently, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol to glycerol. Perilipin 1A is a key protein regulator of lipolysis in adipose tissue. This lipid droplet-associated protein, when deactivated, will prevent the interaction of lipases with triglycerides in the lipid droplet and grasp the ATGL co-activator, comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58) (a.k.a. ABHD5). When perilipin 1A is phosphorylated by PKA, it releases CGI-58 and it expedites the docking of phosphorylated lipases to the lipid droplet. CGI-58 can be further phosphorylated by PKA to assist in its dispersal to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, CGI-58 can co-activate ATGL. ATGL activity is also impacted by the negative regulator of lipolysis, G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2). When expressed, G0S2 acts as a competitive inhibitor in the binding of CGI-58. Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27) (a.k.a CIDEC) is also a negative regulator of lipolysis. FSP-27 expression is negatively correlated with ATGL mRNA levels.",

A particularly important example in animal cells is cholesterol, which helps strengthen the bilayer and decrease its permeability. Cholesterol also helps regulate the activity of certain integral membrane proteins. Integral membrane proteins function when incorporated into a lipid bilayer, and they are held tightly to lipid bilayer with the help of an annular lipid shell. Because bilayers define the boundaries of the cell and its compartments, these membrane proteins are involved in many intra- and inter-cellular signaling processes. Certain kinds of membrane proteins are involved in the process of fusing two bilayers together. This fusion allows the joining of two distinct structures as in the fertilization of an egg by sperm or the entry of a virus into a cell. Because lipid bilayers are quite fragile and invisible in a traditional microscope, they are a challenge to study. Experiments on bilayers often require advanced techniques like electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.",

In addition, when fully developed and implemented clinically, it reduces the demand for allogenic blood and reduces or eliminates blood transfusion related incompatibilities. The primary acoustic radiation force equation tells us that the acoustic force can move particles either towards a node or an anti-node of a standing wave depending on their densities and compressibilities. If the particles are red blood cells and lipid droplets in blood plasma, the erythrocytes gather in the pressure node (in the centre of the channel) while the lipid particles gather in the pressure anti-nodes (by the side walls), Fig. 4. At the end of the channel the red blood cells exit through the centre outlet while the lipid particles exit through the side outlets, separating the two particle types, Fig. 5. visual observations of the separation process performed on human blood could be made, displaying steady streams of lipid particles flowing along the side walls and a well defined band of red blood cells exiting the system through the centre outlet channel, Fig. 6.",

The most generally accepted view on the creation of lipid droplets is that the neutral lipids build up between the ER leaflets due to \"de novo\" synthesizing enzymes for both triglyceride phospholipids and cholesteryl esters. This leads to the budding lipid droplets growing into the cytoplasm space. There are two different groups of lipid droplets that are known: the first is characterized by its phospholipid leaflet in continuity with the membrane of the ER and the second is classified as definitively cytosolic without a connection to the ER.",
