Pigmentation of the \"Drosophila\" wing has proven to be a particularly amenable system for studying the development of complex pigmentation phenotypes. The \"Drosophila guttifera\" wing has 12 dark pigmentation spots and 4 lighter gray intervein patches. Pigment spots arise from expression of the \"yellow\" gene, whose product produces black melanin. Recent work has shown that two enhancers in the \"yellow\" gene produce gene expression in precisely this pattern \u2013 the vein spot enhancer drives reporter gene expression in the 12 spots, and the intervein shade enhancer drives reporter expression in the 4 distinct patches. These two enhancers are responsive to the Wnt signaling pathway, which is activated by \"wingless\" expression at all of the pigmented locations. Thus, in the evolution of the complex pigmentation phenotype, the \"yellow\" pigment gene evolved enhancers responsive to the wingless signal and \"wingless\" expression evolved at new locations to produce novel wing patterns.",

Genome-wide association mapping and gene-expression analysis mapped the Mendelian blue locus, which abolishes yellow pigmentation in the budgerigar. The blue trait maps to a single amino acid substitution (R644W) in an uncharacterized polyketide synthase (MuPKS) gene. When the MuPKS gene is expressed in yeast, yellow pigments accumulated. Mass spectrometry confirmed the yellow pigments matched those in feathers. The R644W substitution abolished MuPKS gene activity. Furthermore, gene-expression data from feathers of different bird species suggest that parrots acquired their colors through regulatory changes that drive high expression of the MuPKS gene in feather epithelia.

            "document": "Leslie D. Gottlieb . A series of subsequent studies in wild plants by Gottlieb bolstered his assertions that important evolutionary changes need not involve many small genes. In 1988 Gottlieb and Ford reported on floral pigmentation in \"Clarkia gracilis\" and discovered a basal spot allele that was unique and normally was unexpressed. They concluded: \"It is an interesting speculation that many loci include alleles that normally remain unexpressed. Segregation following hybridization, frequent in plants, may place such alleles, as well as normally expressed alleles, under new patterns of regulation resulting in the abrupt appearance of novel forms.\" In 1989 Gottlieb concluded that floral spot patterns in \"Clarkia\" were controlled by only a few genes, and that \"The flower is a complex structure in which many specialized tissues and cell types form distinctive organs in a precise and orderly manner. The differentiation of structures is most likely independent of pigmentation pattern, and this is one reason the patterns may be changed by a few genes. Although the patterns may have a simple and readily modified developmental basis, pigment patterns are likely to have complex effects on pollination and eventual seed set.\" Ford and Gottlieb performed an extensive analysis of the genetic control of flower differences between the two closely related species \"Layia glandulosa\" and \"L. discoidea\", related as progenitor and derivative, respectively. The two species differ primarily by presence versus absence of ray florets. They confirmed earlier results that the primary difference in ray flowers was due to a single gene. However, they also found a novel floret called \"gibbous,\" and demonstrated that there were numerous gene differences between the species that affected the ray florets size, shape, and color. They concluded: Characterization of evolutionary morphological changes as major or minor is illusory unless founded on genetic analysis: the demonstration that the absence of ray florets in \"L. discoidea\" is conferred by a simple genetic difference shows that this was not a large change despite the accretion of a considerable number of differences between the species. The discovery of gibbous fiorets has particular interest because it demonstrates that novel combinations of developmental processes can be readily assimilated without evident adverse effects. The complex admixture of genes with large and small, qualitative and quantitative, effects may prove typical as more instances of morphological evolution are subjected to intensive genetic analysis.",

Forbes rounds off the book by looking at the genetic basis of camouflage in butterflies, which has been studied extensively, from the early work (starting in 1954) of P. M. Sheppard and Cyril Clarke on the multiple mimicry of female \"Papilio dardanus\" of various other species of \"Papilio\", controlled by alleles of a single gene. He describes how Miriam Rothschild took time away from her major study of fleas to investigate the toxic chemicals that underlie aposematism (warning coloration) and hence mimicry, showing that monarch butterflies contained cardenolides similar to the heart drug digoxin. She predicted that mimetic butterfly coloration would be shown to be caused by a combination of selection by bird predators and sexual selection by male butterflies, working on preadaptations involving suitable genes which enabled mimicry to develop. Around the same time, Bernard Kettlewell carried out experiments on industrial melanism in the peppered moth, showing that it was driven by bird predators. A generation later, a pioneer of evolutionary developmental biology, Sean B. Carroll, investigated the way that interacting genes such as \"distal-less\" (\"dll\") control the development of butterfly wing patterns. This gene is active at the wing margin of butterflies, and at the centre of their conspicuous eyespots. The gene was known for its effects in the fruit fly; evidently, nature had tinkered with it to give it additional effects. More recent work by Chris Jiggins and others has started to uncover the complex genetics of the wing patterns of the mimetic \"Heliconius\" butterflies; it seems likely that they make use of an evo-devo gene toolkit which they have continually tinkered with, passing genes between species by hybridisation.",

A comparative analysis of CpG methylation patterns between humans and primates found that there were more than 800 genes that varied in their methylation patterns among orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. Despite these apes having the same genes, methylation differences are what account for their phenotypic variation. The genes in question are involved in development. It is not the protein sequences that account for the differences in physical characteristics between humans and apes; rather, it is the epigenetic changes to the genes. Since humans and the great apes share 99% of their DNA, it is thought that the differences in methylation patterns account for their distinction. So far, there are known to be 171 genes that are uniquely methylated in humans, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in chimpanzees and bonobos, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in gorillas, and 450 genes that are uniquely methylated in orangutans. For example, genes involved in blood pressure regulation and the development of the inner ear\u2019s semicircular canal are highly methylated in humans, but not in the apes. There are also 184 genes that are conserved at the protein level between human and chimpanzees, but have epigenetic differences. Enrichments in multiple independent gene categories show that regulatory changes to these genes have given humans their specific traits. This research shows that epigenetics plays an important role in evolution in primates. It has also been shown that cis-regulatory elements changes affect the transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. 471 DNA sequences are found to be enriched or depleted in regards to histone trimethylation at the H3K4 histone in chimpanzee, human, and macaque prefrontal cortexes. Among these sequences, 33 are selectively methylated in neuronal chromatin from children and adults, but not from non-neuronal chromatin. One locus that was selectively methylated was DPP10, a regulatory sequence that showed evidence of hominid adaptation, such as higher nucleotide substitution rates and certain regulatory sequences that were missing in other primates. Epigenetic regulation of TSS chromatin has been identified as an important development in the evolution of gene expression networks in the human brain. These networks are thought to play a role in cognitive processes and neurological disorders. An analysis of methylation profiles of humans and primate sperm cells reveals epigenetic regulation plays an important role here as well. Since mammalian cells undergo reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns during germ cell development, the methylomes of human and chimp sperm can be compared to methylation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). There were many hypomethylated regions in both sperms cells and ESCs that showed structural differences. Also, many of the promoters in human and chimp sperm cells had different amounts of methylation. In essence, DNA methylation patterns differ between germ cells and somatic cells as well as between the human and chimpanzee sperm cells. Meaning, differences in promoter methylation could possible account for the phenotypic differences between humans and primates.",

Although some instances of errors in metabolism following Mendelian inheritance patterns were known earlier, beginning with the 1902 identification by Archibald Garrod of alkaptonuria as a Mendelian recessive trait, for the most part genetics could not be applied to metabolism through the late 1930s. Another of the exceptions was the work of Boris Ephrussi and George Beadle, two geneticists working on the eye color pigments of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" fruit flies in the Caltech laboratory of Thomas Hunt Morgan. In the mid-1930s they found that genes affecting eye color appeared to be serially dependent, and that the normal red eyes of \"Drosophila\" were the result of pigments that went through a series of transformations; different eye color gene mutations disrupted the transformations at a different points in the series. Thus, Beadle reasoned that each gene was responsible for an enzyme acting in the metabolic pathway of pigment synthesis. However, because it was a relatively superficial pathway rather than one shared widely by diverse organisms, little was known about the biochemical details of fruit fly eye pigment metabolism. Studying that pathway in more detail required isolating pigments from the eyes of flies, an extremely tedious process.",

This locus is recognised as affecting coat colour through the expression of pheomelanin, the pigment responsible for red and yellow pigmentation. The effects on pheomelanin pigmentation are only seen if there is no eumelanin expressed in the fur, else the dark eumelanin will mask any pheomelanin present, and thus these differences are visible only in yellow Labradors. The result is dogs of colours ranging from a red to a light cream. It had long been thought that the genetic locus for this trait was the same seen regulating pheomelanin in other mammals, subsequently identified as tyrosinase. This enzyme makes both eumelanin and pheomelanin, and when subject to a knockout mutation results in albinism. A less extreme mutation of the same tyrosinase gene, the so-called \"Chinchilla\" trait, produces a dilution that selectively affects pheomelanin alone, similar to the phenotype observed in yellow Labradors. Thus, as with \"Chinchilla\"-related pheomelanin dilution in other species, this trait in Labradors has been represented by the letter C. However, genetic analysis of the inheritance of coat colour in yellow Labradors has shown that the locus responsible is entirely distinct from the \"Chinchilla\" trait of the tyrosinase gene, and likewise is distinct from SLC45A2, the so-called cream gene responsible for the dilution of pheomelanin in buckskin, palomino and cremello horses and also for the absence of pheomelanin in the white tiger, while a mutation in SLC7A11 found to cause pheomelanin dilution in mice was not found in a survey of cream-coloured dogs. The gene responsible for colour variation within the yellow Labrador remains unidentified, but the variation it causes is formally recognised as part of the normal pigmentation spectrum seen within Labradors.

A dog that is very dark red, like an Irish Setter may sometimes appear brown. Dogs with a blend of Black and Red/Yellow fur can also look like they have brown areas. An easy way to tell if a dog is Liver or not is to look at their nose. Eumelanin (black) pigment colors a dog's nose, so a Liver dog will have a Liver colored nose. If the nose is black, the dog is not a liver. A pink nose has nothing to do with liver dilution, and will not help determine if a dog is liver or not. Liver will also dilute a dog's brown eyes to amber/yellow.",

The majority can change their color depending on things like emotions (for example, aggression or stress), activity level, levels of light and as a social signal (for example, displaying dominance), but evidence showing that they do it in response to the color of the background (camouflage) is lacking. Whether they do it in response to temperature (thermoregulation) is less clear, with studies supporting it and contradicting it. The extent and variations of this color changing ability differ widely throughout the individual species. For example, the Carolina (or green) anole can change its color from a bright, leafy green to a dull brown color, while the brown anole can only change its shade, ranging from pale gray-brown to very dark brown. Even the distinct green-to-brown change in the Carolina anole can happen in only a few minutes. The colors are the result of their skin pigment cells, the chromatophores, of which they have three main types, but the change occurs only in the melanophores. When triggered by melanophore-stimulating hormone and other hormones, the melanosomes of the melanophores partially cover the other skin pigment cells, giving the anole a darker or browner color. In most cases stress results in a darker/browner color, but in the aquatic anole, a species that is dark brown with a barred pattern and light brown stripes on the sides of its body and head, stress results in paler brown upperparts and the stripes turn pale blue-green.",

            "document": "Feather . The functional view on the evolution of feathers has traditionally focused on insulation, flight and display. Discoveries of non-flying Late Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs in China, however, suggest that flight could not have been the original primary function as the feathers simply would not have been capable of providing any form of lift. There have been suggestions that feathers may have had their original function in thermoregulation, waterproofing, or even as sinks for metabolic wastes such as sulphur. Recent discoveries are claimed to support a thermoregulatory function, at least in smaller dinosaurs. While feathers have been suggested as having evolved from reptilian scales, there are numerous objections to that idea, and more recent explanations have arisen from the paradigm of evolutionary developmental biology. Theories of the scale-based origins of feathers suggest that the planar scale structure was modified for development into feathers by splitting to form the webbing; however, that developmental process involves a tubular structure arising from a follicle and the tube splitting longitudinally to form the webbing. The number of feathers per unit area of skin is higher in smaller birds than in larger birds, and this trend points to their important role in thermal insulation, since smaller birds lose more heat due to the relatively larger surface area in proportion to their body weight. The miniaturization of birds also played a role in the evolution of powered flight. The coloration of feathers is believed to have evolved primarily in response to sexual selection. In one fossil specimen of the Parave \"Anchiornis huxleyi\", the features are so well preserved that the melanosome (pigment cells) structure can be observed. By comparing the shape of the fossil melanosomes to melanosomes from extant birds, the color and pattern of the feathers on \"Anchiornis\" could be determined. \"Anchiornis\" was found to have black-and-white-patterned feathers on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with a reddish-brown crest. This pattern is similar to the coloration of many extant bird species, which use plumage coloration for display and communication, including sexual selection and camouflage. It is likely that non-avian dinosaur species utilized plumage patterns for similar functions as modern birds before the origin of flight. In many cases, the physiological condition of the birds (especially males) is indicated by the quality of their feathers, and this is used (by the females) in mate choice.",

The display may be repeated two or three times before the bird returns to a perch. On the ground the male performs a bowing display with his neck inflated to show off the iridescent neck patches; meanwhile, the tail is raised, fanned, then closed again.

In Europe, the leading prey species numerically (the main prey species in 41% of 32 European studies largely focused on the nesting season) is the rock pigeon (\"Columba livia\"). Although the predominance of rock pigeons in urban environments that host goshawks such as the German cities of Hamburg (where they constituted 36% by number and nearly 45% by weight of the local diet) or Cologne is predictable, evidence shows that these development-clinging pigeons are sought out even within ample conserved woodland from Portugal to Georgia. In areas where goshawk restrict their hunting forays to field and forest, they often catch another numerous pigeon, the common wood pigeon (\"Columba palumbus\") (the largest pigeon the goshawk naturally encounters and is known to hunt). The latter species was the main prey in the diet of northern goshawks from in the Dutch-German border (37.7% of 4125 prey items) and Wales (25.1% by number and 30.5% by biomass of total prey). It has been theorized that male goshawks in peri-urban regions may be better suited with their higher agility to ambushing rock pigeons in and amongst various manmade structures whereas females may be better suited due the higher overall speeds to taking out common wood-pigeons, as these typically forage in wood-cloaked but relatively open fields; however males are efficient predators of common wood-pigeons as well. Studies have proven that, while hunting rock pigeons, goshawks quite often select the oddly colored pigeons out of flocks as prey, whether the plumage of the flock is predominantly dark or light hued, they disproportionately often select individuals of the other color. This preference is apparently more pronounced in older, experienced goshawks and there is some evidence that the males who select oddly-colored pigeons have higher average productivity during breeding. Around eight additional species of pigeon and dove have turned up in the goshawks diet from throughout the range but only in small numbers and in most of North America, goshawks take pigeons less commonly than in Eurasia. One exception is in Connecticut where the mourning dove (\"Zenaida macroura\"), the smallest known pigeon or dove the goshawk has hunted at , was the second most numerous prey species.",
