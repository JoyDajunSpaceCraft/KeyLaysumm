A detailed model of membrane channel formation that reveals membrane insertion mechanism is constructed. Shatursky et al. studied the membrane insertion mechanism of Perfringolysin O (PFO), a cholesterol-dependent pore-forming cytolysin produced by pathogenic Clostridium perfringens. Instead of using a single amphipathic \u03b2 hairpin per plypeptide, PFO monomer contains two amphipathic \u03b2 hairpins, each spans the whole membrane. Larry et al. focused on the membrane penetrating models of RTX toxins, a family of MDT secreted by many gram-negative bacteria.

The mechanism of pore formation of perfingolysin O (PFO; TC# 1.C.12.1.1), which is secreted by \"Clostridium perfringens\", begins with encountering and binding to cholesterol on the target membrane. The C-terminus of PFO domain 4 (D4) encounters the membrane first. The binding of D4 triggers a structural rearrangement in which the PFO monomers oligomerize forming the pre-pore complex. The binding of CDC to the target membrane is required for oligmerization. The oligomerization of the CDC requires the conversion of alpha-helical regions to amphipathic beta-strands that is initiated by protein-lipid interactions or protein-protein interactions. The water-soluble form of the toxins is prevented from oligomerizing by having the access of one edge of a core \u03b2-sheet in the monomer blocked. To be specific, \u03b25, a short polypeptide loop, hydrogen-bonds to \u03b24, preventing \u03b24 interaction with \u03b21 on the adjacent monomer. The binding of D4 to the membrane surface triggers a conformational change in domain 3, which rotates \u03b25 away from \u03b24, exposing \u03b24 allowing it to interact with the \u03b21 strand of another PFO molecule, initiating oligomerization. Unlike most of the exposed surface residues of CDC that are not conserved the residues at the surface of the D4 tip, which are involved in membrane interactions, are highly conserved. Pore formation begins once two amphipathic transmembrane \u03b2-hairpins from ~35 PFO monomers are inserted in a concerted fashion, which then create a large \u03b2-barrel that perforates the membrane. The toxin gets around the energy barrier, of inserting the CDC into the membrane, by the formation of the \u03b2-barrel, which will lower the energy requirements compared to what would be required for the insertion of single \u03b2-hairpins. In the water-soluble monomeric form of CDC, the transmembrane \u03b2-hairpins that are located on both sides of the central \u03b2-sheet on domain 3 are each folded as three short \u03b1-helices to minimize the exposure of hydrophobic residues. The \u03b1-helices are inserted into the target cell membrane bilayer and a conformational change takes place into amphipathic \u03b2-hairpins. A concerted mechanism of insertion is required so that the hydrophilic surfaces of the \u03b2-hairpins remain exposed to the aqueous medium, and not the hydrophobic membrane core. Six short \u03b1-helices in D3 unfold to form two transmembrane \u03b2-hairpin (TMH), TMH1 (red) and TMH2 (green).",

A hydrophobicity plot lacking any patterns which are common to possible membrane-spanning domains. The structures of other multimeric membrane proteins (such as diphtheria toxin) provide the answer to how PA manages to span the membrane. It is thought that PA acts like these multimeric membrane proteins that form \u03b2-barrels made from stretchs of both polar and non-polar amino acids from each monomer. The formation of the \u03b2-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination of the structure of domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. The only problem is that the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a \u03b2-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a \u03b2-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a \u03b2-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 \u00c5 (1.2\u00a0nm), which fits the theoretical value of this model.",

This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer is often referred to as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF.

In some crystal forms the hexamers assemble further in a side-by-side fashion to form a tightly packed molecular layer, which presumably is how the facets of the shell are assembled. Small pores perforate many different types of BMC-H hexamers, and may serve as the route for diffusion of small substrates (e.g. bicarbonate) into and out of the carboxysome. Positively charged amino acids in the pores presumably help promote the diffusion of the negatively charged substrates and products. Other minor structural components of the shell that have been characterized include pentameric proteins (BMC-P proteins), which have been proposed to occupy the vertices of the icosahedral shell. A third building block of the carboxysome shell is a protein composed of two BMC domains in tandem (BMC-T proteins). Structurally, many of these are known to form trimers which are pseudohexameric. Some members of the BMC-T protein family stack in a face-to-face fashion and form tiny cages. Based on crystal structures, these protein cages have relatively large gated pores on both sides, and it has been proposed that the opening and closing of the pore could be controlled in a manner similar to an air-lock. Such an air-lock, in contrast to BMC-H proteins with constitutively open pores, has been suggested to serve as a route for larger substrates (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) and products (3-phosphoglycerate) that must cross the shell.",

This mechanism involves strong interactions between cell-penetrating peptides and the phosphate groups on both sides of the lipid bilayer, the insertion of positively charged arginine side-chains that nucleate the formation of a transient pore, followed by the translocation of cell-penetrating peptides by diffusing on the pore surface. This mechanism explains how key ingredients, such as the cooperation among the peptides, the large positive charge, and specifically the guanidinium groups, contribute to the uptake. The proposed mechanism also illustrates the importance of membrane fluctuations. Indeed, mechanisms that involve large fluctuations of the membrane structure, such as transient pores and the insertion of charged amino acid side-chains, may be common and perhaps central to the functions of many membrane protein functions.",

Porous membranes find use in the microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and dialysis applications. There is some controversy in defining a \u201cmembrane pore\u201d. The most commonly used theory assumes a cylindrical pore for simplicity. This model assumes that pores have the shape of parallel, nonintersecting cylindrical capillaries. But in reality a typical pore is a random network of the unevenly shaped structures of different sizes. The formation of a pore can be induced by the dissolution of a \"better\" solvent into a \"poorer\" solvent in a polymer solution. Other types of pore structure can be produced by stretching of crystalline structure polymers. The structure of porous membrane is related to the characteristics of the interacting polymer and solvent, components concentration, molecular weight, temperature, and storing time in solution. The thicker porous membranes sometimes provide support for the thin dense membrane layers, forming the asymmetric membrane structures.

In order for LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize to the cell and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer is often referred to as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell.

The mechanism of pore formation of perfingolysin O (PFO; TC# 1.C.12.1.1), which is secreted by \"Clostridium perfringens\", begins with encountering and binding to cholesterol on the target membrane. The C-terminus of PFO domain 4 (D4) encounters the membrane first. The binding of D4 triggers a structural rearrangement in which the PFO monomers oligomerize forming the pre-pore complex. The binding of CDC to the target membrane is required for oligmerization. The oligomerization of the CDC requires the conversion of alpha-helical regions to amphipathic beta-strands that is initiated by protein-lipid interactions or protein-protein interactions. The water-soluble form of the toxins is prevented from oligomerizing by having the access of one edge of a core \u03b2-sheet in the monomer blocked. To be specific, \u03b25, a short polypeptide loop, hydrogen-bonds to \u03b24, preventing \u03b24 interaction with \u03b21 on the adjacent monomer. The binding of D4 to the membrane surface triggers a conformational change in domain 3, which rotates \u03b25 away from \u03b24, exposing \u03b24 allowing it to interact with the \u03b21 strand of another PFO molecule, initiating oligomerization. Unlike most of the exposed surface residues of CDC that are not conserved the residues at the surface of the D4 tip, which are involved in membrane interactions, are highly conserved. Pore formation begins once two amphipathic transmembrane \u03b2-hairpins from ~35 PFO monomers are inserted in a concerted fashion, which then create a large \u03b2-barrel that perforates the membrane. The toxin gets around the energy barrier, of inserting the CDC into the membrane, by the formation of the \u03b2-barrel, which will lower the energy requirements compared to what would be required for the insertion of single \u03b2-hairpins. In the water-soluble monomeric form of CDC, the transmembrane \u03b2-hairpins that are located on both sides of the central \u03b2-sheet on domain 3 are each folded as three short \u03b1-helices to minimize the exposure of hydrophobic residues. The \u03b1-helices are inserted into the target cell membrane bilayer and a conformational change takes place into amphipathic \u03b2-hairpins. A concerted mechanism of insertion is required so that the hydrophilic surfaces of the \u03b2-hairpins remain exposed to the aqueous medium, and not the hydrophobic membrane core.

These tubules are essential for uptake into the host cell. When the protein is inside the cell, the A subunit interacts with the ribosomes to inactivate them. The A subunit of Shiga toxin is an N-glycosidase that modifies the RNA component of the ribosome to inactivate it and so bring a halt to protein synthesis leading to the death of the cell. The vascular endothelium has to continually renew itself, so this killing of cells leads to a breakdown of the lining and to hemorrhage. The first response is commonly a bloody diarrhea.

From cases contracted through raw or supposedly pasteurized milk, one may safely assume that, in susceptible persons, fewer than 1,000 total organisms may cause disease. \"L. monocytogenes\" may invade the gastrointestinal epithelium. Once the bacterium enters the host's monocytes, macrophages, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes, it becomes bloodborne (septicemic) and can grow. Its presence intracellularly in phagocytic cells also permits access to the brain and probably transplacental migration to the fetus in pregnant women. The pathogenesis of \"L. monocytogenes\" centers on its ability to survive and multiply in phagocytic host cells. It seems that \"Listeria\" originally evolved to invade membranes of the intestines, as an intracellular infection, and developed a chemical mechanism to do so. This involves a bacterial protein \"internalin\"(InlA/InlB) which attaches to a protein on the intestinal cell membrane \"cadherin\" and allows the bacteria to invade the cells through a zipper mechanism. These adhesion molecules are also to be found in two other unusually tough barriers in humans\u00a0\u2014 the blood-brain barrier and the fetal\u2013placental barrier, and this may explain the apparent affinity that\" Listeria\" has for causing meningitis and affecting babies \"in utero\".

This frees the pathogen and gives it access to the cytosol of the cell, where it continues its pathogenesis. Motility in the intracellular space is provided by actin assembly-inducing protein (ActA) which allows the bacteria to use the host cell's actin polymerization machinery to polymerize the cytoskeleton to give a \"boost\" to the bacterial cell so it can move in the cell.

The alpha toxin produced by \"C. septicum\" is the underlying cause of gas gangrene, otherwise known as myonecrosis; a disease characterized by extensive tissue destruction, edema, thrombosis, and fluid-filled bullae. Alpha toxin is a pore-forming toxin exotoxin that is secreted as a protoxin that requires proteolytic cleavage of a 5kDa peptide from its carboxy-terminal in order to become active. Cleavage is typically initiated by the cell surface protease furin. Once activated, the toxin can oligomerize and form ion-permeable pores through the cell membrane. Pores formed by alpha toxin are approximately 1.5\u00a0nm in diameter, allowing the release of potassium ions from erythrocytes, thus disrupting the ionic equilibrium within the cell. Alpha toxin binds GPI-anchored cell surface receptors including the human folate receptor (hFR) as well as the neuronal molecules contactin and Thy-1 (CD90).  Quite surprisingly, the alpha toxin of \"C. septicum\" is not related to the alpha toxin of \"C. perfringens\" (another bacterium implicated in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene). \"C. septicum\" alpha toxin does, however, exhibit similarities to aerolysin, another beta-pore forming toxin. Alpha toxin and aerolysin share approximately 72% sequence similarity and have numerous functional similarities as well. Both proteins require cleavage by furin, or a furin-like protease, and then oligomerize to form transmembrane pores. Similarities between the two toxins have also been discovered through analysis of the crystal structure of aerolysin. Aerolysin is a bilobar protein consisting of four domains (D1-D4). The smallest lobe of aerolysin is missing in the alpha toxin of \"C. septicum\", implying that the alpha toxin is monolobar with three domains, similar to domains D2-D4 in aerolysin. Further research has led to the conclusions that the D1 domain is involved in receptor-binding and the D3 domain functions to prevent premature oligomerization of alpha toxin.",

These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the endosome, the enzymatic components of the toxin translocate into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration.
