Prehistoric stone tools and fossils have been found in and around Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania, an area often referred to as \"The Cradle of Mankind\". Acheulian stone tools were discovered there in 1931 by Louis Leakey, after he had correctly identified the rocks brought back by Hans Reck to Germany from his 1913 Olduvai expedition as stone tools. The same year, Louis Leakey found older, more primitive stone tools in Olduvai Gorge. These were the first examples of the oldest human technology ever discovered in Africa, and were subsequently known throughout the world as Oldowan after Olduvai Gorge. The first hominid skull in Olduvai Gorge was discovered by Mary Leakey in 1959, and named Zinj or Nutcracker Man, the first example of \"Paranthropus boisei\", and is thought to be over 1.8 million years old. Other finds including \"Homo habilis\" fossils were subsequently made. At nearby Laetoli the oldest known hominid footprints, the Laetoli footprints, were discovered by Mary Leakey in 1978, and estimated to be about 3.6 million years old and probably made by \"Australopithecus afarensis\". The oldest hominid fossils ever discovered in Tanzania also come from Laetoli and are the 3.6 to 3.8 million year old remains of \"Australopithecus afarensis\"\u2014Louis Leakey had found what he thought was a baboon tooth at Laetoli in 1935 (which was not identified as afarensis until 1979), a fragment of hominid jaw with three teeth was found there by Kohl-Larsen in 1938\u201339, and in 1974\u201375 Mary Leakey recovered 42 teeth and several jawbones from the site.",

The preservation of the tracks has been attributed to volcanic activity that instantly covered the paleosurface. It was Hugo B\u00f6ckh, who, at the base of the giant tree, originally discovered the prehistoric animal footprints in 1900. The original discovery, a 4x4 m slab with footprints was transported to Budapest within a year, where it is still displayed in the Hungarian Geological Institute's (HGI) well-known lecture hall, hence known as \"Footprint Hall.\" In the 1920s, 30's and 60's Ferenc Nopcsa, and later Tasn\u00e1di also enriched the Institute's collections by excavating more footprints (Tasn\u00e1di, 1976). In the early 1980s, the footprints were mapped during the construction of the first of several facilities built to protect them; 1298 tracks were registered on the site, while the total number reached 1644, together with the specimens in the HGI collections (Kordos, 1985). Explorations in the 1990s doubled the figure of footprints on the site to 2762. The extent of the known area with footprints explored at Ipolytarn\u00f3c in the last hundred years exceeds 1500 sq. m. The whole site, which is estimated as being 50-100 times larger than the currently exposed areas and is mostly continuous can only be explored after removing the rhyolite tuff bed. Such exposure of the surface containing the footprints should only be undertaken if they can be preserved from weathering. Therefore, scientific exploration only takes place gradually, and requires subsequent protective measures. Analysis of the footprints started immediately after their discovery, and it was known a hundred years ago that there were tracks of rhinoceroses, ungulates and birds. The first scientific description of the footprints was in 1935, in a book by Othenio Abel (Abel, 1935), who identified footprints of a rhinoceros, a proboscidean, cervids, an ancestral triungulate horse, a large carnivore as well as birds. He illustrated them with photographs. Following the studies of Tasn\u00e1di, the \"Ipolytarn\u00f3c\" monograph of \"Geologica Hungarica\" series \"Palaeontologica\" was issued in 1985, for the Regional Committee on Mediterranean Neogene Stratigraphy (RCMNS) congress, where L. Kordos identified 11 animal species based on all footprints known at the time.  The commonest avian species are the medium-sized \"Ornithotarnocia lambrechti\" with three toeprints and the similar-sized \"Tetraorniothopedia tasnadii\" that left four toeprints behind, while \"Aviadactyla media\" is characterized by rod-like, straight toeprints. Tracks of the small songbird \"Passeripeda ipolyensis\" are present but not as common as those of the other birds. The most common mammalian footprints include the rounded and three-hooved footprints of adult and juvenile, prehistoric rhinoceroses (\"Rhinoceripeda tasnadyi\") as well as those of smaller (\"Pecoripeda hamori\") and larger (\"Megapecoripeda miocaenica\") ungulates. Numerous carnivores lived here 20 million years ago. Amongst them, the largest footprints belong to the rare \"Bestiopeda maxima\", first illustrated by Abel (1935). Astonishingly fresh-looking and distinct are the three footprints of a single individual of \"Carnivoripeda nogradensis\", the blurry tracks of \"Bestiopeda tarnocensis\", and the clawprints of a peculiar mustelid, \"Mustelipeda punctata\" (Kordos, 1985).",

Nevertheless, some scholars argue that the dating method at both Java sites is unclear, especially the collective method of the rock and the relationships between the rock and the fossils. In fact, the remains in Java were found in more than these two sites, such as Ngandong (\"homo soloensis\") and Kedung.",

For the next 80 years they attracted relatively little interest, largely due to the difficulty of reaching the area. In the 1980s interest in the site resumed as four wheel drive vehicles became more readily available. Continuing interest coincided with the site being visited by fossil collectors, and many bones were removed, prompting calls for the site to be conserved. The remains display the typical streamlined body form of modern whales, yet retaining some of the primitive aspects of skull and tooth structure. The largest skeleton found reached up to 21 m in length, with well-developed five-fingered flippers on the forelimbs and the unexpected presence of hind legs, feet, and toes, not known previously in any archaeoceti. Their form was serpentine and they were carnivorous. A few of these skeletal remains are exposed but most are shallowly buried in sediments, slowly uncovered by erosion. Wadi El-Hitan provides evidences of millions of years of coastal marine life. Fossils are present in high numbers and often show excellent quality of preservation. The most conspicuous fossils are the skeletons and bones of whales and sea cows, and over several hundred fossils of these have been documented.  The fossils of whales vary from single bones to entire skeletons, and a number of partial skeletons are currently on display in the public part of the park. The two common whales are the large \"Basilosaurus\", and the smaller (3 to 5 metre) \"Dorudon.\" At least two other species are known from rarer remains. The whales possess small hind limbs, that are not seen in modern whales, and a powerful skull with teeth similar to those of carnivorous land mammals. Other mammals are represented by the skeletons of three species of sirenia or sea cows. These were fully marine like the whales, and likewise show primitive features not seen in modern species and possess teeth that suggest that they grazed on seagrasses and other marine plants. Bones of the primitive elephant \"Moeritherium\" have also been recorded.  Fossil reptiles are represented by fossils of crocodiles and sea turtles, and bones of sea snakes have also been recorded.  There are many species of bony fish, sharks and rays represented, but most of the fossils are isolated small teeth and these are not often conspicuous. Larger fish fossils include the rostra and pegs of sawfish; a sawfish rostrum of 1.8 metres long is laid out in the park.  Fossil shells are not common in the main whale-bearing rocks, but are very common in other rocks; many fallen rocks can be seen to be full of a wide variety of fossil shells.

If observations on the relationship between sexual dimorphism and social group structure from modern gorillas are applied to \"A. afarensis\", then these creatures may have lived in small family groups containing a single dominant male and a number of breeding females.

In the early 1980s, the footprints were mapped during the construction of the first of several facilities built to protect them; 1298 tracks were registered on the site, while the total number reached 1644, together with the specimens in the HGI collections (Kordos, 1985). Explorations in the 1990s doubled the figure of footprints on the site to 2762. The extent of the known area with footprints explored at Ipolytarn\u00f3c in the last hundred years exceeds 1500 sq. m. The whole site, which is estimated as being 50-100 times larger than the currently exposed areas and is mostly continuous can only be explored after removing the rhyolite tuff bed. Such exposure of the surface containing the footprints should only be undertaken if they can be preserved from weathering. Therefore, scientific exploration only takes place gradually, and requires subsequent protective measures. Analysis of the footprints started immediately after their discovery, and it was known a hundred years ago that there were tracks of rhinoceroses, ungulates and birds. The first scientific description of the footprints was in 1935, in a book by Othenio Abel (Abel, 1935), who identified footprints of a rhinoceros, a proboscidean, cervids, an ancestral triungulate horse, a large carnivore as well as birds. He illustrated them with photographs. Following the studies of Tasn\u00e1di, the \"Ipolytarn\u00f3c\" monograph of \"Geologica Hungarica\" series \"Palaeontologica\" was issued in 1985, for the Regional Committee on Mediterranean Neogene Stratigraphy (RCMNS) congress, where L. Kordos identified 11 animal species based on all footprints known at the time.  The commonest avian species are the medium-sized \"Ornithotarnocia lambrechti\" with three toeprints and the similar-sized \"Tetraorniothopedia tasnadii\" that left four toeprints behind, while \"Aviadactyla media\" is characterized by rod-like, straight toeprints. Tracks of the small songbird \"Passeripeda ipolyensis\" are present but not as common as those of the other birds. The most common mammalian footprints include the rounded and three-hooved footprints of adult and juvenile, prehistoric rhinoceroses (\"Rhinoceripeda tasnadyi\") as well as those of smaller (\"Pecoripeda hamori\") and larger (\"Megapecoripeda miocaenica\") ungulates. Numerous carnivores lived here 20 million years ago. Amongst them, the largest footprints belong to the rare \"Bestiopeda maxima\", first illustrated by Abel (1935). Astonishingly fresh-looking and distinct are the three footprints of a single individual of \"Carnivoripeda nogradensis\", the blurry tracks of \"Bestiopeda tarnocensis\", and the clawprints of a peculiar mustelid, \"Mustelipeda punctata\" (Kordos, 1985).",

This evidence also suggests that \"H.

This has been put forth as evidence that a small pack of \"Acrocanthosaurus\" was stalking a herd of sauropods. While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and other explanations exist. For example, several solitary theropods may have moved through in the same direction at different times after the sauropods had passed, creating the appearance of a pack stalking its prey. The same can be said for the purported \"herd\" of sauropods, who also may or may not have been moving as a group. At a point where it crosses the path of one of the sauropods, one of the theropod trackways is missing a footprint, which has been cited as evidence of an attack. However, other scientists doubt the validity of this interpretation because the sauropod did not change gait, as would be expected if a large predator were hanging onto its side.",

The footprints had been imprinted in mud, which allowed the feet to sink down . The prints were sloppy, and the varying breadth of the toe prints indicates that mud had clung to the feet. The impressions varied according to differences in the substrate and the manner in which they were made; sometimes the foot was planted directly, but there was often a backwards or forwards slip as the foot came down. The positions and angles of the toes also varied considerably, which indicates they must have been quite flexible. The \"Dilophosauripus\" footprints had an offset second toe with a thick base, and very long, straight claws that were in line with the axes of the toe-pads. One of the footprints was missing the claw of the second toe, perhaps due to injury.

With the use of in vivo Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tissue sampling, different cortical samples from members of each hominoid species were analyzed. In each species, specific areas were either relatively enlarged or shrunken, which can detail neural organizations. Different sizes in the corticol areas can show specific adaptations, functional specializations and evolutionary events that were changes in how the hominoid brain is organized. In early prediction it was thought that the frontal lobe, a large part of the brain that is generally devoted to behavior and social interaction, predicted the differences in behavior between hominoid and humans. Discrediting this theory was evidence supporting that damage to the frontal lobe in both humans and hominoids show atypical social and emotional behavior; thus, this similarity means that the frontal lobe was not very likely to be selected for reorganization. Instead, it is now believed that evolution occurred in other parts of the brain that are strictly associated with certain behaviors. The reorganization that took place is thought to have been more organizational than volumetric; whereas the brain volumes were relatively the same but specific landmark position of surface anatomical features, for example, the lunate sulcus suggest that the brains had been through a neurological reorganization. There is also evidence that the early hominin lineage also underwent a quiescent period, which supports the idea of neural reorganization. Dental fossil records for early humans and hominins show that immature hominins, including australopithecines and members of \"Homo\", reveal that these species have a quiescent period (Bown et al. 1987). A quiescent period is a period in which there are no dental eruptions of adult teeth; at this time the child becomes more accustomed to social structure, and development of culture. During this time the child is given an extra advantage over other hominoids, devoting several years into developing speech and learning to cooperate within a community. This period is also discussed in relation to encephalization. It was discovered that chimpanzees do not have this neutral dental period and suggest that a quiescent period occurred in very early hominin evolution. Using the models for neurological reorganization it can be suggested the cause for this period, dubbed middle childhood, is most likely for enhanced foraging abilities in varying seasonal environments.
