Plants that use the C carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases fixation and, thus, the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf. plants can produce more sugar than plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called C plants because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle.

            "document": "Guangxi Guitang Group . The Guitang Group constructed an eco-industrial park (EIP) with two main value chains: a paper chain, and an alcohol chain. Each of these chains deals with different by-products to make final products in each stage of production. The alcohol chain includes a sugar refinery, an alcohol plant, and a fertilizer plant. Each by-product of production at each stage of the chain provides an input of raw material to the next stage. A description of how each chain operates is described by a case study on the Guitang Group. \"The sugarcane enters the sugar mill and is processed along one of two product chains: the sugar chain (containing the originally conceived sugar refinery and the alcohol plant) or the paper chain (containing the pulp and paper mills). Each downstream (internal) company uses the by-products from upstream companies as secondary material inputs. In addition, careful attention is given to reducing the residual waste and to its ultimate disposal. The sugar chain results in the ultimate production of sugar, alcohol, cement, and compound fertilizer (i.e., fertilizer with a specific ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). In the sugar refinery, the sugarcane \u201cjuice\u201d that is released in the crushing and grinding assembly in the sugar mill is refined in a carbonation process that yields a higher quality refined sugar than does the sulfitation process that is used by the majority of cane sugar plants in China (Wei 2004). Wei notes that sulfitation is favored by the GG\u2019s competitors, in part, because the filter mud (one of the wastes from the refining process) from sulfitation can easily be disposed of as a direct application fertilizer. Filter mud from the carbonation process, on the other hand, can have a significant negative effect on the local soil if it is applied directly to the land. The GG has addressed this problem by using the carbonation filter mud as an input to the State-owned cement production facility it manages, rather than as a fertilizer. The GG contributes the filter mud and pays for transportation costs, balancing the savings from not having to pay for disposal. The fuel for the cement plant is coal, introducing an added environmental burden on the symbiosis. The residues from the alcohol plant (molasses)\u2014which once would have been released into the environment\u2014are now used as input to the production of compound fertilizer, which goes back to the sugarcane fields, thus closing this loop. The paper chain is driven by the input of bagasse, which is the residue from the sugar mill, minus the pith; that is, the soft interior portion of the cane. Sixty percent of the bagasse has fibers long enough for paper-making. The short fibers of the pith are used as fuel in a cogeneration power plant. Earlier, the GG burnt the bagasse in its power plant and sold it to homeowners for cooking and heating. The pulping operation that prepares the bagasse for conversion into paper requires a significant addition of alkali, which ends up in the residue of that operation. The GG has constructed an alkali recovery plant that recycles the waste from the pulping operation (black liquor), generating a white sludge that can be used as input to the cement mill, which is primarily a part of the sugar chain. The pulp is processed by one of the three paper mills, where a major waste (white liquor) is generated and subsequently treated to recover major portions of fiber and water, which are recycled to the paper mills.\u201d",

Lignocellulosic ethanol is made by freeing the sugar molecules from cellulose using enzymes, steam heating, or other pre-treatments.

However, at higher temperatures and lower CO concentrations, RuBisCO adds oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, to form the unusable product glycolate in a process called photorespiration. To prevent this wasteful process, plants increase the local CO concentration in a process called the cycle. PEP carboxylase plays the key role of binding CO in the form of bicarbonate with PEP to create oxaloacetate in the mesophyll tissue. This is then converted back to pyruvate (through a malate intermediate), to release the CO in the deeper layer of bundle sheath cells for carbon fixation by RuBisCO and the Calvin cycle.

The use of oxygen as a substrate appears to be a puzzling process, since it seems to throw away captured energy.

This weakness in the enzyme is the cause of photorespiration, such that healthy leaves in bright light may have zero net carbon fixation when the ratio of to reaches a threshold at which oxygen is fixed instead of carbon. This phenomenon is primarily temperature-dependent. High temperature decreases the concentration of dissolved in the moisture in the leaf tissues. This phenomenon is also related to water stress.

Yeast metabolize the carbohydrate source to form a number of compounds including ethanol. The process of brewing beer starts with malting and mashing, which breaks down the long carbohydrates in the barley grain into more simple sugars. This is important because yeast can only metabolize very short chains of sugars. Long-carbohydrates are polymers, large branching linkages of the same molecule over and over. In the case of barley, we mostly see polymers called amylopectin and amylose which are made of repeating linkages of glucose. On very large time-scales (thermodynamically) these polymers would break down on their own, and there would be no need for the malting process. The process is normally sped up by heating up the barley grain. This heating process activates protein enzymes called amylases. The shape of these enzymes, their active site, gives them the unique and powerful ability to speed these degradation reactions to over 100,000 times faster. The reaction that takes place at the active site is called a hydrolysis reaction, which is a cleavage the linkages between the sugars. Repeated hydrolysis breaks the long amylopectin polymers into simpler sugars that can be digested by the yeast. Hops are the flowers of the hops plant \"Humulus lupulus\".

Isotopic fractionation is differs between C4 carbon fixation and C3, due to the spatial separation in C4 plants of CO capture (in the mesophyll cells) and the Calvin cycle (in the bundle sheath cells). In C4 plants, carbon is converted to bicarbonate, fixed into oxaloacetate via the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase, and is then converted to malate. The malate is transported from the mesophyll to bundle sheath cells, which are impermeable to CO. The internal CO is concentrated in these cells as malate is reoxidized then decarboxylated back into CO and pyruvate. This enables RuBisCO to perform catalysis while internal CO is sufficiently high to avoid the competing photorespiration reaction. The delta value in the C4 pathway is -12 to -16\u2030 depleted in C due to the combined effects of PEP carboxylase and RuBisCO.",

Over the course of Earth's geologic history concentrations have played a role in biological evolution. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide as sources of electrons, rather than water. Cyanobacteria appeared later, and the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen catastrophe, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. In recent geologic times, low concentrations below 600 parts per million might have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 plants which increased greatly in abundance between 7 and 5 million years ago over plants that use the less efficient C3 metabolic pathway. At current atmospheric pressures photosynthesis shuts down when atmospheric concentrations fall below 150 ppm and 200 ppm although some microbes can extract carbon from the air at much lower concentrations. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130\u00a0terawatts, which is about six times larger than the current power consumption of human civilization.
