These processes are cell proliferation, cell specialization, cell interaction and cell movement.

Almost all animals undergo a similar sequence of events during embryogenesis and have, at least at this developmental stage, the three germ layers and undergo gastrulation.

The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages.

Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell.

A cellular adhesion forms between the lamellae, reducing the actins' retrograde flow rate in the area immediately surrounding the adhesion. Consequently, the cells' velocity and motility are reduced. This then allows actin stress fibers and microtubules to form and align with each other in both colliding partners. The alignment of these stress fibers locally accumulates elastic tension in the lamellae. Eventually, the tension buildup becomes too great, and the cell adhesion complex dissociates, collapses the lamellae protrusions, and releases the cells in different directions in an effort to alleviate the elastic tension. A possible alternate event that also leads to the assembly dissociation is that upon stress fiber alignment, the cells' leading edges repolarize away from the contiguous lamellae. This produces significant elastic tension across the entire cell bodies, \"not only at the local site of contact\", and likewise causes the adhesion complex's disassembly. Elastic tension has been thought to be the primary driving force of the protrusion collapse, complex disassembly, and the cells' dispersion. Though this hypothetical tension has been characterized and visualized, how tension builds in lamellae and how cell repolarization contributes to tension buildup remain open to investigation.  Furthermore, as replication increases the amount of cells, the number of directions those cells can move without touching another is decreased. Cells will also attempt to move away from another cell because they stick better to the area around them, a structure called the substratum, than on other cells.

In an attractor network, interactions between neurons cause activity to stabilize, such that one state is preferred and other states suppressed. In the case of head direction, the cells are conceptualized as forming an imaginary ring, with each cell exciting cells coding for its own or neighboring directions, and suppressing cells coding for other directions. Direct evidence for such an organization in insects was recently reported: in mammals it is assumed that the \"ring\" is distributed, and not a geometric anatomical form. However, anatomical evidence for such excitatory interconnections between head direction cells is lacking.

In another key example, live single-cell studies of CDK2 activity in mammalian cells demonstrated that bifurcation in CDK2 activity following mitosis, determined whether cells would continue to proliferate or enter a state of quiescence; now shown, using live single-cell methods, to be caused by stochastic DNA damage inducing upregulation of p21, which inhibits CDK2 activity. Moving forward, live single cell studies will now likely incooperate multiple reporters into single cell lines to allow complex decision making processes to be understood, however challenges still remain in scaling up live single cell studies.",

Beyond the interactions with external synthetic materials, cells have been imaged with X-ray crystallography and there has been much curiosity about their behavior \"in vivo\". Studies have taken advantage of AFM to obtain further information on the behavior of live cells in biological media. Real-time atomic force spectroscopy (or nanoscopy) and dynamic atomic force spectroscopy have been used to study live cells and membrane proteins and their dynamic behavior at high resolution, on the nanoscale. Imaging and obtaining information on the topography and the properties of the cells has also given insight into chemical processes and mechanisms that occur through cell-cell interaction and interactions with other signaling molecules (ex. ligands). Evans and Calderwood used single cell force microscopy to study cell adhesion forces, bond kinetics/dynamic bond strength and its role in chemical processes such as cell signaling.  Scheuring, L\u00e9vy, and Rigaud reviewed studies in which AFM to explore the crystal structure of membrane proteins of photosynthetic bacteria.

Adherens junctions are composed primarily of E-cadherin, alpha and beta catenins and other transmembrane proteins such as actin and myosin. The junctions formed are vital in creating cell-cell contacts and do so via the interactions of all the different components. E-cadherins on separate cells use calcium based interactions to bind, whilst the catenins bind the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton of each cell, thus creating the cadherin-catenin complex. Vezatin co-localises with E-cadherin at these cell-cell junctions suggesting that in fact it is involved within adherens junctions . E-cadherin is an important transmembrane molecule in creating and facilitating adherens junctions, particularly in epithelial cells. Furthermore, vezatin does not appear at focal adhesion sites and does not co-localise with desmogleins, which are molecules present in desmosomes, suggesting it is solely responsible for interactions within the adherens junction . Additionally, in cells lacking E-cadherin and thus unable to form cell-cell contacts, vezatin displayed a cytoplasmic distribution .  Another key component of this junction is the protein myosin VIIA and primarily its interaction with vezatin. Myosins are mechanochemical proteins which interact with actins and enzymatically convert ATP to ADP in order to facilitate a motor function . Myosin VIIA is an unconventional member of the myosin family and is heavily expressed within ciliated epithelium such as that in the nose and the ear . Myosin VIIA has a similar structure to all other myosins, with a motor, neck and actin-binding domain, but is unique due to its short tail domain . Vezatin has been shown to interact with this tail domain due to co-localisation of both molecules in mouse inner-ear epithelial cells . However, this interaction was only observed during cell-cell contact junctions, otherwise the proteins are dispersed through the cytoplasm in individual cells . These results taken together suggest that vezatin plays a crucial role in the cadherin-catenin complex which is essential for cell-cell adhesion.",

The cell consists of a nucleus, digestive vacuoles and thin reticulopodia (Grell, 1995). The long thin reticulopodia stretch outwards from the cell to form networks across a substrate (Bass et al., 2012). The network created can be larger in diameter than the cell itself (Bass et al., 2012). The reticulopodia present bidirectionally motile granules and move slowly enabling them to change the size and the shape of the network formed (Bass et al., 2012). The first described species of \"Reticulamoeba\" was found associated with diatoms on which they feed (Bass et al., 2012). The reticulopodia are what interacts with the diatoms during feeding by penetrating the diatom frustules (Bass et al., 2012).

The other tissue is called \"leptom\", which surround the hadrom and contains smaller cells. This tissue is, on the other hand, analogous to phloem.

Another characteristic feature of the species (and the genus) is its parallel photosynthetic lamellae on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Most mosses simply have a single plate of cells on the leaf surface, but common haircap moss has more highly differentiated photosynthetic tissue. This is an example of a xeromorphic adaption, an adaptation for dry conditions. Moist air is trapped in between the rows of lamellae, while the larger terminal cells act to contain moisture and protect the photosynthetic cells. This minimises water loss as relatively little tissue is directly exposed to the environment, but allows for enough gas exchange for photosynthesis to take place. The microenvironment between the lamellae can host a number of microscopic organisms such as parasitic fungi and rotifers.

Somatic epigenetic inheritance, particularly through DNA and histone covalent modifications and nucleosome repositioning, is very important in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop, morphogens activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a memory. In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only stem cells retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types (\"totipotency\" and \"multipotency\"). In mammals, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, such as in neurogenesis, but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of. Epigenetic modifications regulate the transition from neural stem cells to glial progenitor cells (for example, differentiation into oligodendrocytes is regulated by the deacetylation and methylation of histones. Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant.

Leaves catch light in order to manufacture nutrients. For both of these organs to remain living, minerals that the roots acquire must be transported to the leaves, and the nutrients manufactured in the leaves must be transported to the roots. Plants have developed a number of ways to achieve this transport, such as vascular tissue, and the functioning of the various modes of transport is studied by plant physiologists.",

Early in their evolutionary history, the ancestors of modern cacti (other than one group of \"Pereskia\" species) developed stomata on their stems and began to delay developing bark. However, this alone was not sufficient; cacti with only these adaptations appear to do very little photosynthesis in their stems. Stems needed to develop structures similar to those normally found only in leaves. Immediately below the outer epidermis, a hypodermal layer developed made up of cells with thickened walls, offering mechanical support. Air spaces were needed between the cells to allow carbon dioxide to diffuse inwards. The center of the stem, the cortex, developed \"chlorenchyma\" \u2013 a plant tissue made up of relatively unspecialized cells containing chloroplasts, arranged into a \"spongy layer\" and a \"palisade layer\" where most of the photosynthesis occurs.",

Because the plant vascular system is vital in growth and development of plant cells and the organs within the plant, the role of sieve elements in the transport of necessary carbohydrates and macromolecules is largely expanded. This can be applied to agriculture to observe the way resources are distributed to various parts of the plant. Plasmodesmata connect companion cells to sieve elements and parenchyma cells can connect the sieve tubes to various tissues within the plant. This system between the plasmodesmata, companion cells, and sieve tubes allow for the delivery of necessary metabolites. The yield of agricultural product could potentially be increased to maximize the delivery system of these specialized cells within the phloem in a way that diffusion can be maximized. It has been discovered that the angiosperm phloem can use the sieve tubes as a way to transport various forms of RNA to sink tissues which can help alter transcriptional activity. Sink tissues are tissues that are in the process of growth and need nutrients. Having Sieve elements transport additional nutrients to sink tissues can speed up the growth process, which can affect plant growth and development. Overtime, rapid growth has the potential of leading to a greater agricultural output.",

Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo. Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form from the callus. The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant. Somatic embryos are mainly produced \"in vitro\" and for laboratory purposes, using either solid or liquid nutrient media which contain plant growth regulators (PGR\u2019s). The main PGRs used are auxins but can contain cytokinin in a smaller amount. Shoots and roots are monopolar while somatic embryos are bipolar, allowing them to form a whole plant without culturing on multiple media types. Somatic embryogenesis has served as a model to understand the physiological and biochemical events that occur during plant developmental processes as well as a component to biotechnological advancement. The first documentation of somatic embryogenesis was by Steward et al. in 1958 and Reinert in 1959 with carrot cell suspension cultures.",

The (dynamic and environment responsive) pattern of auxin distribution within the plant is a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs (such as leaves or flowers).

Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a nervous system. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones.

Cerebral organoids are created by culturing human pluripotent stem cells in a three-dimensional rotational bioreactor and develop over a course of months. The human brain is an extremely complex system of heterogeneous tissues and consists of an extremely diverse array of neurons. This complexity  has made studying the brain and understanding how it works a difficult task in neuroscience, especially  when it comes to neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of creating an in vitro neurological model is to  study these diseases in a more simple and variable space; free of in vivo limitations, especially when  working with humans. The varying physiology between human and other mammalian models limits the  scope of study in neurological disorders. Cerebral organoids are synthesized tissues that contain several types of nerve cells and have anatomical features that resemble mammalian brains. Cerebral organoids are most similar to layers of neurons called the cortex and choroid plexus. In some cases, structures similar to the retina, meninges and hippocampus can form. Stem cells have the potential to grow into many different types of tissues and their fate is dependent on many factors. Below is an image showing some of the chemical factors that can lead stem cells to differentiate into various neural tissues.

These underground organs, such as bulbs, corms and tubers, are often fleshy with water-storing tissues. Thus if roots are included in the definition, many geophytes would be classed as succulents.

However, not all xerophytes are succulents, since there are other ways of adapting to a shortage of water, e.g., by developing small leaves which may roll up or having leathery rather than succulent leaves.
