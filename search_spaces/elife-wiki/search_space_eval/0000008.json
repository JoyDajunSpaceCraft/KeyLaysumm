Most of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them as a source of energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be joined together to make polymers such as DNA and proteins, essential macromolecules of life. Proteins are made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain joined together by peptide bonds. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as those that form the cytoskeleton, a system of scaffolding that maintains the cell shape. Proteins are also important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, active transport across membranes, and the cell cycle. Amino acids also contribute to cellular energy metabolism by providing a carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle), especially when a primary source of energy, such as glucose, is scarce, or when cells undergo metabolic stress.",

It is also useful because enzymes can be purposefully manipulated by changing certain amino acids. If an amino acid is changed that is in close proximity to the active site, the kinetic parameters may change drastically, or the enzyme might behave in a different way. Another application of site directed mutagenesis is exchanging an amino acid residue far from the active site with a lysine residue or cysteine residue. These amino acids make it easier to covalently bond the enzyme to a solid surface, which allows for enzyme re-use and use of enzymes in continuous processes.

However, some bacteria such as Mycobacterium smegmatis as well as mammals and yeast use a type I synthase which is a large multifunctional protein similar to the synthase used for polyketide synthesis. This Type I synthase includes discrete domains on which individual reactions are catalyzed. In both fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis, the intermediates are covalently bound to ACP, or Acyl Carrier Protein. However, in fatty acid synthesis the original molecules are Acyl-CoA or Malonyl-CoA but poyketide synthases can use multiple primers including Acetyl-CoA, Propionyl-CoA, Isobutyrl-CoA, Cyclohexanoyl-CoA, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, or Cinnamyl-CoA. In both fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis these CoA carriers will be exchanged for ACP before they are incorporated into the growing molecule. During the elongation steps of fatty acid synthesis, ketosynthase, ketoreductase, dehydratase, and enoylreductase are all used in sequence to create a saturated fatty acid then postsynthetic modification can be done to create an unsaturated or cyclo fatty acid. However, in polyketide synthesis these enzymes can be used in different combinations to create segments of polyketide that are saturated, unsaturated, or have a hydroxyl or carbonyl functional group. There are also enzymes used in both fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis that can make modifications to the molecule after it has been synthesized. As far as regulating the length of the molecule being synthesized, the specific mechanism by which fatty acid chain length remains unknown but it is expected that ACP-bound fatty acid chains of the correct length act as allosteric inhibitors of the fatty acid synthesis enzymes. In polyketide synthesis, the synthases are composed of modules in which the order of enzymatic reactions is defined by the structure of the protein complex. This means that once the molecule reaches the last reaction of the last module, the polyketide is released from the complex by a thioesterase enzyme. Therefore, regulation of fatty acid chain length is most likely due to allosteric regulation, and regulation of polyketide length is due to a specific enzyme within the polyketide synthase.",

To date, a number of QFR enzymes have been crystalized and the specifics of enzyme structure varies between organisms; however, the overall structure remains similar across different species. Fumarate reductase complexes include four subunits. Subunit A contains the site of fumarate reduction and a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group. It is closely bound to subunit B, which contains three iron-sulfur centers, all placed near to each other and the nearby substrates. Subunit C consists of hydrophobic membrane-spanning, primarily helical segments and is the site of quinol oxidization. In some fumarate reductase structures, one or more heme groups are additionally bound to the C subunit and participate in the electron transfer. The D subunit contains hydrophobic alpha helices that span the membrane, but does not participate in the catalytic action of the enzyme. It may be required to anchor the catalytic components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic membrane. The reduction of fumarate in fumarate reductase is achieved via the oxidation of a quinol bound to subunit C and the resulting transfer of electrons down a chain of iron-sulfur clusters onto a waiting FAD molecule. The edge-to-edge distances between the quinol, the iron sulfur clusters, and the FAD in this enzyme do not exceed 12.5 Angstroms and can be seen on the image below. These short distances between electron receptors allow electrons to travel down the chain at a physiologically reasonable timescale. Once electrons have travelled down the iron-sulfur clusters, they pass onto the FAD molecule bound to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The final reduction of the fumarate is achieved in the active site where the asymmetrical charges from the nearby amino acids polarize the fumarate and distort its shape. Once the fumarate is no longer planar, a hydride from the bound FAD molecule in the active site attacks the double bond to reduce the fumarate. Thus, in this reaction, the fumarate serves as the terminal electron acceptor.  Succinate dehydrogenase (SQR) is a key enzyme in both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain in the mitochondria of eukaryotes and single celled organisms. It is a key enzyme in aerobic respiration and it performs the opposite reaction of QFR, by coupling the reduction of a quinone to the formation of succinate for use in the citric acid cycle.",

Epoxygenases are a set of membrane-bound, heme-containing cytochrome P450 (CYP P450 or just CYP) enzymes that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to epoxide products that have a range of biological activities. The most thoroughly studied substrate of the CYP epoxylgenases is arachidonic acid. This polyunsaturated fatty acid is metabolized by cyclooxygenases to various prostaglandin, thromboxane, and prostacyclin metabolites in what has been termed the first pathway of eicosanoid production; it is also metabolized by various lipoxygenases to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (e.g. 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid) and leukotrienes (e.g. leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4) in what has been termed the second pathway of eicosanoid production. The metabolism of arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids by the CYP epoxygenases has been termed the third pathway of eicosanoid metabolism. Like the first two pathways of eicosanoid production, this third pathway acts as a signaling pathway wherein a set of enzymes (the epoxygenases) metabolize arachidonic acid to a set of products (the eicosatrienoic acid epoxides, abbreviated as EETs, which are classified as nonclassic eicosanoids) that act as secondary signals to work in activating their parent or nearby cells and thereby orchestrate functional responses. However, none of these three pathways is limited to metabolizing arachidonic acid to eicosanoids. Rather, they also metabolize other polyunsaturated fatty acids to products that are structurally analogous to the eicosanoids but often have different bioactivity profiles. This is particularly true for the CYP epoxygenases which in general act on a broader range of polyunsaturated fatty acids to form a broader range of metabolites than the first and second pathways of eicosanoid production. Furthermore, the latter pathways form metabolites many of which act on cells by binding with and thereby activating specific and well-characterized receptor proteins; no such receptors have been fully characterized for the epoxide metabolites. Finally, there are relatively few metabolite-forming lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases in the first and second pathways and these oxygenase enzymes share similarity between humans and other mammalian animal models. The third pathway consists of a large number of metabolite-forming CYP epoxygenases and the human epoxygenases have important differences from those of animal models. Partly because of these differences, it has been difficult to define clear roles for the epoxygenase-epoxide pathways in human physiology and pathology.",

The energy from photosynthesis is used, in part, for the biosynthesis of cellular materials from nitrogenous compounds.

            "document": "Bacterial morphological plasticity . For \"Burkholderia pseudomallei\", some clinical antibiotic agents that are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some \u03b2-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the \"minimal inhibitory concentration\" (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. However, the \"B.pseudomallei\" filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. Furthermore, for \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\", filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (\"lipopolysaccharide, LPS\") release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol. The molecular correlate of the filament formation was described. The exposure to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics induced the SOS response in \"Escherichia coli\". During repair of DNA damage, the SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division. Moreover, both \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and genetic mutation induce SOS in \"E.coli\" through the DpiBA \"two-component signal transduction system\" leading to the inactivation of the ftsl gene product, penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP-3). The ftsl gene is a group of filamentous temperature-sensitive genes implicated in cell division. In addition, it is a membrane transpeptidase required for peptidoglycan synthesis at the septum generated by cell division. The event to inactivate ftsl gene product requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA and transiently inhibits bacterial cell division. Consequently, the bactericidal effects of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are limited. The DpiA is the effector for the DpiB two-component system. Interaction of DpiA with replication origins competes with the binding of the replication proteins DnaA and DnaB. When overexpressed, DpiA can interrupt DNA replication and induce the SOS response resulting in inhibition of cell division.",

When the cell has been filled with the correct keratin and structured correctly, it undergoes keratin stabilization and dies, a form of programmed cell death. This results in a fully matured, non-vascular keratin cell. These fully matured, or cornified, alpha-keratin cells are the main components of hair, the outer layer of nails and horns, and the epidermis layer of the skin.",

            "document": "Cytoplasmic streaming . Cytoplasmic streaming occurs due to the motion of organelles attached to actin filaments via myosin motor proteins. However, in \"Chara corallina\", the organization of actin filaments is highly ordered. Actin is a polar molecule, which means that myosin only moves in one direction along the actin filament. Thus, in \"Chara corallina\", where motion of the chloroplasts and the mysoin molecule follow a barber pole pattern, the actin filaments must all be similarly oriented within each section. In other words, the section where the chloroplasts move upward will have all of the actin filaments oriented in the same upward direction, and the section where the chloroplasts move downward will have all the actin filaments oriented in the downward direction. This organization emerges naturally from basic principles. With basic, realistic assumptions about the actin filament, Woodhouse demonstrated that the formation of two sets of actin filament orientations in a cylindrical cell is likely. His assumptions included a force keeping the actin filament in place once set down, an attractive force between filaments leading them to be more likely align as a filament already in place, and a repulsive force preventing alignment perpendicular to the length of the cylindrical cell. The first two assumptions derive from the molecular forces within the actin filament, while the last assumption was made due to the actin molecule's dislike of curvature. Computer simulations run with these assumptions with varying parameters for the assumptive forces almost always leads to highly ordered actin organizations. However, no order was as organized and consistent as the barber pole pattern found in nature, which suggests this mechanism plays role, but is not wholly responsible for the organization of actin filaments in \"Chara corallina\".",

As the environments of most organisms are constantly changing, the reactions of metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the \"regulation\" of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the \"control\" exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (\"i.e.\" it is highly regulated) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway. There are multiple levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates to respond to changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.",
