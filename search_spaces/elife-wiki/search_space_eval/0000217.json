Their results identified a subset of radiomic features that may be useful for predicting patient survival and describing intratumoural heterogeneity. They also confirmed that the prognostic ability of these radiomics features may be transferred from lung to head-and-neck cancer. However, Parmar et al.

They offer a unique opportunity to noninvasively access the wealth of biological information related to their cells of origin. The quantity and molecular composition of microvesicles released from malignant cells varies considerably compared with those released from normal cells. Thus, the concentration of plasma microvesicles with molecular markers indicative of the disease state may be used as an informative blood-based biosignature for cancer. microvesicles express many membrane-bound proteins, some of which can be used as tumor biomarkers. Several tumor markers accessible as proteins in blood or urine have been used to screen and diagnose various types of cancer. In general, tumor markers are produced either by the tumor itself or by the body in response to the presence of cancer or some inflammatory conditions. If a tumor marker level is higher than normal, the patient is examined more closely to look for cancer or other conditions. For example, CA19-9, CA-125, and CEA have been used to help diagnose pancreatic, ovarian, and gastrointestinal malignancies, respectively. However, although they have proven clinical utility, none of these tumor markers are highly sensitive or specific.

In order to understand the role of CpG island hypermethylation in cancer, it is useful to consider a particular tumor type, called CpG island methylator prototype, or CIMP. Higher levels of CpG island hypermethylation are found in CIMP. The frequent occurrence of hypermethylation was first described in colorectal cancer and later for glioma. More recently, it has been studied for neuroblastomas. The frequent hypermethylation of CpG islands in these tumors as well as their irregularity are ways to determine that hypermethylated CpGs differ by tumor type. This would imply that colorectal cancer will not necessarily have the same set of hypermethylated CpG islands as in a glioma. This clinical distinctness of tumors can be interpreted by doctors. To zoom in further, let us focus on colorectal CIMP, as this was one of the first of its kind to be described. Patients in this category of cancer tend to be older and female and have a defective MLH1 function. The tumors are usually in the ascending colon. They also have a good prognostic outcome, so if a patient were diagnosed with this variety of CIMP, they are likely to have a good outcome. These clinically distinct phenotypes of CIMP also suggest that there is potential for epigenetic therapy.  CpG islands that are hypermethylated can play three roles in cancer: in diagnosis, prognosis and in monitoring. In diagnosis, one can identify the tumor type and tumor subtype, as well as its primary tumor when that is unknown. Hypermethylation increases with tumorigenicity, which is an indication of the prognosis of cancer. For example, high methylation is a marker for poor prognosis in lung cancer. CpG island hypermethylation shows much promise for molecular monitoring of patients with cancer. It is also a potential target for therapeutic use.",

Elastography is useful in medical diagnoses, as elasticity can discern healthy from unhealthy tissue for specific organs/growths. For example, cancerous tumours will often be harder than the surrounding tissue, and diseased livers are stiffer than healthy ones. There are a several elastographic techniques based on the use of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and tactile imaging. The wide clinical use of ultrasound elastography is a result of the implementation of technology in clinical ultrasound machines. Main branches of ultrasound elastography include Quasistatic Elastography/Strain Imaging, Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI), Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse imaging (ARFI), Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI), and Transient Elastography. In the last decade a steady increase of activities in the field of elastography is observed demonstrating successful application of the technology in various areas of medical diagnostics and treatment monitoring.",

Radiation therapy may be used to treat almost every type of solid tumor, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, uterus, or soft tissue sarcomas. Radiation is also used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. Radiation dose to each site depends on a number of factors, including the radio sensitivity of each cancer type and whether there are tissues and organs nearby that may be damaged by radiation. Thus, as with every form of treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects. Radiation therapy kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA (the molecules inside cells that carry genetic information and pass it from one generation to the next) (1).Radiation therapy can either damage DNA directly or create charged particles (free radicals) within the cells that can in turn damage the DNA. (2) Radiation therapy can lead to dry mouth from exposure of salivary glands to radiation. The salivary glands lubricate the mouth with moisture or spit. Post therapy, the salivary glands will resume functioning but rarely in the same fashion. Dry mouth caused by radiation can be a lifelong problem. The specifics of your brain cancer radiation therapy plan will be based on several factors, including the type and size of the brain tumor and the extent of disease. External beam radiation is commonly used for brain cancer. The area radiated typically includes the tumor and an area surrounding the tumor. For metastatic brain tumors, radiation is sometimes given to the entire brain. Radiation therapy uses special equipment to send high doses of radiation to the cancer cells. Most cells in the body grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster than many of the normal cells around them. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cell. Radiation might not be a choice of treatment if the tumour was diagnosed on the late stage or is located on vulnerable places. Moreover, radiation causes significant side effects if used in children aged 0\u201314. It was determined to be a beneficial treatment but it causes significant side effects that influence the lifestyle of the young patients. Radiotherapy is the use of high-energy rays, usually x-rays and similar rays (such as electrons) to treat disease. It works by destroying cancer cells in the area that's treated. Although normal cells can also be damaged by radiotherapy, they can usually repair themselves, but cancer cells can't. If the tumour was found on the late stage, it requires patients to have higher radiation exposure which might be harmful for the organs. Radiotherapy is determined to be an effective treatment in adults but it causes significant side effects that can influence patients` daily living. In children radiotherapy mostly causes long-term side effects such as hearing loss and blindness. Children who had received cranial radiotherapy are deemed at a high risk for academic failure and cognitive delay. Study by Reddy A.T. determined the significant decrease in IQ with higher doses of radiation, specifically for children with brain tumours. Radiation therapy is not the best treatment for brain tumours, especially in young children as it causes significant damages. There are alternative treatments available for young patients such as surgical resection to decrease the occurrence of side effects.",

For the first time, BPA was used as the boron delivery agent, and patients were irradiated with a collimated beam of higher energy epithermal neutrons, which had greater tissue-penetrating properties than thermal neutrons. A research group headed up by Zamenhof at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School and MIT was the first to use an epithermal neutron beam for clinical trials. Initially patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated and this was expanded to include patients with brain tumors, specifically melanoma metastatic to the brain and primary glioblastomas (GBMs). Included in the research team were Otto Harling at MIT and the Radiation Oncologist Paul Busse at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. A total of 22 patients were treated by the Harvard-MIT research group. Five patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated using an epithermal neutron beam at the MIT research reactor (MITR-II) and subsequently patients with brain tumors were treated using a redesigned beam at the MIT reactor which possessed far superior characteristics to the original MITR-II beam, and BPA as the capture agent. The clinical outcome of the cases treated at Harvard-MIT has been summarized by Busse. Although the treatment was well tolerated, there were no significant differences in the mean survival times of patients that had received BNCT compared to those who received conventional external beam X-irradiation.",

Thus, the concentration of plasma microvesicles with molecular markers indicative of the disease state may be used as an informative blood-based biosignature for cancer. microvesicles express many membrane-bound proteins, some of which can be used as tumor biomarkers. Several tumor markers accessible as proteins in blood or urine have been used to screen and diagnose various types of cancer. In general, tumor markers are produced either by the tumor itself or by the body in response to the presence of cancer or some inflammatory conditions. If a tumor marker level is higher than normal, the patient is examined more closely to look for cancer or other conditions.

Removing heterogeneity is of substantial interest to isolate expression data from mixed samples \"in silico\". It is important to estimate and account for the tumor purity, or the percentage of cancer cells in the tumor sample before analyses. Owing to the marked differences between cancer and normal cells, it is possible to estimate tumor purity from high-throughput genomic or epigenomic data. DeMix is a method that has been developed to estimate the proportion and gene expression profile from cancer cells in mixed samples. In this method the mixed sample is assumed to be composed only by two cell types: cancer cells (without any a priori known gene expression profile) and normal cells (with known gene expression data, which can either come from tumor-matched or unmatched samples). This method was developed for microarray data and shows that it was important to use the raw data as input assuming it follows a log-normal distribution as is the case for microarray, instead of working with log-transformed data like most other methods did. DeMix estimates the variance of the gene expression in the normal samples and uses this in the maximum likelihood estimation to predict the cancer cell gene expression and proportions, using thus implicitly a gene-specific weight for each gene. It is the first method to follow a linear mixture of gene expression levels on data before they are log-transformed. This method analyzes data from heterogeneous tumor samples before the data are log-transformed, estimates individual level expression levels in each sample and each gene in an unmatched design.",

Key findings included that tumor response was a good predictor of patient survival, and that tumor shrinkage during treatment was a good predictor of long-term outcome. Importantly, the vast majority of tumors identified as high risk by molecular signature. However, heterogeneity within this group of women and measuring response within tumor subtypes was more informative than viewing the group as a whole. Within genetic signatures, level of response to treatment appears to be a reasonable predictor of outcome. Additionally, its shared database has furthered the understanding of drug response and generated new targets and agents for subsequent testing.",

            "document": "CpG island hypermethylation . In order to understand the role of CpG island hypermethylation in cancer, it is useful to consider a particular tumor type, called CpG island methylator prototype, or CIMP. Higher levels of CpG island hypermethylation are found in CIMP. The frequent occurrence of hypermethylation was first described in colorectal cancer and later for glioma. More recently, it has been studied for neuroblastomas. The frequent hypermethylation of CpG islands in these tumors as well as their irregularity are ways to determine that hypermethylated CpGs differ by tumor type. This would imply that colorectal cancer will not necessarily have the same set of hypermethylated CpG islands as in a glioma. This clinical distinctness of tumors can be interpreted by doctors. To zoom in further, let us focus on colorectal CIMP, as this was one of the first of its kind to be described. Patients in this category of cancer tend to be older and female and have a defective MLH1 function. The tumors are usually in the ascending colon. They also have a good prognostic outcome, so if a patient were diagnosed with this variety of CIMP, they are likely to have a good outcome. These clinically distinct phenotypes of CIMP also suggest that there is potential for epigenetic therapy.  CpG islands that are hypermethylated can play three roles in cancer: in diagnosis, prognosis and in monitoring. In diagnosis, one can identify the tumor type and tumor subtype, as well as its primary tumor when that is unknown. Hypermethylation increases with tumorigenicity, which is an indication of the prognosis of cancer. For example, high methylation is a marker for poor prognosis in lung cancer. CpG island hypermethylation shows much promise for molecular monitoring of patients with cancer. It is also a potential target for therapeutic use.",

The cells from neuroblastoma patients have been examined, comparing those with a high expression of the CD133 glycoprotein to those with a low expression of CD133. The following are the characteristics of high-expression CD133 that provide evidence for its tumor-initiating properties: The tumor-initiating properties of CD133 provide evidence for it to be a practical target of chemotherapeutic treatment for neuroblastoma. Through genotype analysis CD133 expression is found to be associated with the expression of the EFNA2 protein. This protein can play a role in cancer development. It is expressed in stem cells and can promote the formation of tumors. For these reasons, it can also be used for chemotherapy treatment in neuroblastoma patients. Through genotype analysis, the presence of this protein can be detected in neuroblastoma patients who also have high-expression CD133. In developing drugs for the treatment of neuroblastoma, pharmaceutical companies are experimenting with the use of CD133 and the associated EFNA2 protein as targets.",
