An acetate is a negative ion with the chemical formula of CHO. Deacetylation can be performed by either chemical hydrolysis or acetylesterase. Chemical hydrolysis is the cleavage of a chemical bond by addition of water. In the reaction, water (HO) reacts with the acetic ester functional group attached the cellulose polymer chain and forms an alcohol and acetate. The alcohol is simply the cellulose polymer chain with the acetate replaced with an alcohol group. The second reaction is exactly the same as chemical hydrolysis with the exception of the use of an acetylesterase enzyme. The enzyme, found in most plants, catalyzes the chemical reaction shown below. In the case of the enzymatic reaction, the two substrates (reactants) are again acetic ester and HO, the two products of the reaction are alcohol and acetate. This reaction is exactly the same as the chemical hydrolysis. Both of these products are perfectly fine in the environment. Once the acetate group is removed from the cellulose chain, the polymer can be readily degraded by cellulase, which is another enzyme found in fungi, bacteria, and protozoans. Cellulases break down the cellulose molecule into monosaccharides (\"simple sugars\") such as beta-glucose, or shorter polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. These simple sugars are not harmful to the environment and are in fact are a useful product for many plants and animals. The breakdown of cellulose is of interest in the field of biofuel.

Mo is found in the active sites of metalloenzymes that perform key transformations in the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, arsenic, selenium, sulfur, and chlorine compounds. The mononuclear Mo enzymes are widely distributed in the biosphere; they catalyze many significant reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds as well as various carbonyl compounds (e.g., aldehydes, CO, and CO). Nitrate reductases enzymes are important for the nitrogen cycle. They belong to a class of enzymes with a mononuclear Mo center and they catalyze the metabolism reaction of C, N, S, etc., in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans. Due to the oxidation of sulfides, The first considerable development was that of aerobic bacteria which could now utilize Mo. As oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere and oceans, the reaction of MoS to MoO also increased. This reaction made the highly soluble molybdate ion available for incorporation into critical metalloenzymes, and may have thus allowed life to thrive. It allowed organisms to occupy new ecological niches. Mo plays an important role in the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia, which occurs in one type of nitrogenases. These enzymes are used by bacteria that usually live in a symbiotic relationship with plants; their role is nitrogen fixation, which is vital for sustaining life on earth.

Enzymes having phospholipase B activity hydrolyze both the \"sn-1\" and \"sn-2\" positions, so they produce both 1-lysoPC and 2-lysoPC. In humans, a number of enzymes with phospholipase A1 exist: they include two from the brain (with different optimal pHs), two from the liver (one cytosomal and one membrane-bound) and one from the mitochondrion. 1-LysoPC can be produced as a by-product of the reaction transferring an acyl group from a phosphatidylcholine to an acceptor molecule, resulting in the formation of an esterified acceptor molecule. In the human, an example of such a transacylation reaction is that catalyzed by the enzyme LRAT that converts an all-\"trans\" retinol to an all-\"trans\"-retinyl ester. The latter is a storage form of Vitamin A in various tissues, as well as a visual pigment precursor in the retina (see visual cycle). 1-LysoPC is also a by-product of the reaction in which N-arachidonoyl-1,2-diacyl-glycerol 3-phosphoethanolamine (NAPE) is produced. This is a rate-limiting step for the synthesis of anandamide and related signaling lipids. Two enzymes are known to catalyze this reaction. LRAT-like protein (RLP-1; a product of the gene HRASLS5), catalyzes transfer of an acyl group from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidylethanol (PE), resulting in the formation of radioactive NAPE. RLP-1 does not show selectivity with respect to the \"sn-1\" and \"sn-2\" positions of PC as an acyl donor and therefore can generate N-arachidonoyl-PE (an anandamide precursor) from 2-arachidonoyl-PC and PE. There is also a Ca-dependent, membrane-associated enzyme (whose gene is currently not known) that is specific for the \"sn-1\"-acyl group of PC. 1-lysoPC can be hydrolyzed further by lysophospholipases to lose the remaining fatty acid and yield L-1-glycero-3-phosphocholine. In humans, 1-lysoPC can be hydrolyzed by ten different enzymes: calcium-independent phospholipase A2-gamma (coded by the gene PNPLA8), neuropathy target esterase (PNPLA6), lysophospholipase (PLB1), eosinophil lysophospholipase (CLC), galactoside-binding soluble lectin 13 (LGALS13), Group XV phospholipase A2 (PLA2G15), acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (LYPLA1), lysophospholipase (PLA2G4A), acyl-protein thioesterase 2 (LYPLA2) and PNPLA7 (Some of these enzymes also have phospholipase A2 activity).

Ribozymes also perform a more limited set of reactions, although their reaction mechanisms and kinetics can be analysed and classified by the same methods.

However, at relatively high substrate concentrations, the reaction rate asymptotically approaches the theoretical maximum; the enzyme active sites are almost all occupied by substrates resulting in saturation, and the reaction rate is determined by the intrinsic turnover rate of the enzyme.

His research at NCI centered on working out how the body metabolizes environmental carcinogens, such as one of the most common in our environment, benzopyrene, which occurs in tobacco smoke, auto exhaust, and other smoke-producing sources. His laboratory identified the genes for the many cytochrome P-450 enzymes that detoxify various environmental carcinogens. These enzymes break down hazardous chemicals into molecules that can be safely excreted by the kidney. He developed the foundation for a genetic profile that could screen individuals for susceptibility to certain carcinogens, foods, and drugs. Gelboin pioneered early research on how chemicals, drugs, and carcinogens are metabolized by enzymes in small lipid vesicles (microsomes) in the liver. He demonstrated that microsomal enzymes convert certain carcinogens to a form that tightly bound to DNA, and he then showed that those enzymes were of the cytochrome P-450 class. That finding revealed how pro-carcinogens can be converted in the body to substances that damage DNA and that can lead to mutations or cancer. He developed monoclonal antibodies to the cytochrome P-450 enzymes and, not only used them for research in his laboratory, but distributed them worldwide to allow other laboratories and pharmaceutical companies to use them in their development of new drugs. His work served as the foundation for the concept of in vitro activation of procarcinogens to substances that damage DNA, which was the basis for a widely used test of chemicals for their cancer-producing potential (the Ames test). His laboratory was the first to introduce high-performance liquid chromatography to the study of metabolism (chemical conversions in the body) of certain hazardous chemicals to which people may be exposed.His work had a huge impact on the fields of chemical carcinogenesis, drug and carcinogen metabolism, and on studies of the cytochrome P-450 drug and carcinogen metabolizing enzymes.  During his career at NIH, Gelboin received numerous awards, including four NIH Merit awards, a technology transfer award, an honorary D.Sc. degree, a Nakasone Lecture Award and a Claude Bernard Award. He presented many keynote lectures, organized research conferences, participated in the work of several committees that evaluated research proposals, and edited several books on chemical carcinogenesis. One of his publications, a paper on development of a widely used assay for a key enzyme in the metabolism of carcinogens, became an Institute for Scientific Exchange Citation Classic. He held eight patents related to his research.

Thus elemental sulfur can either give or receive electrons depending on its environment. Minerals such as pyrite (FeS) comprise the original pool of sulfur on earth. Owing to the sulfur cycle, the amount of mobile sulfur has been continuously increasing through volcanic activity as well as weathering of the crust in an oxygenated atmosphere. Earth's main sulfur sink is the oceans SO, where it is the major oxidizing agent. When SO is assimilated by organisms, it is reduced and converted to organic sulfur, which is an essential component of proteins. However, the biosphere does not act as a major sink for sulfur, instead the majority of sulfur is found in seawater or sedimentary rocks especially pyrite rich shales and evaporite rocks (anhydrite and baryte). The amount of sulfate in the oceans is controlled by three major processes: There is no significant amount of sulfur held in the atmosphere with all of it coming from either sea spray or windblown sulfur rich dust, neither of which is long lived in the atmosphere. In recent times the large annual input of sulfur from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels adds a substantial amount SO which acts as an air pollutant. In the geologic past, igneous intrusions into coal measures have caused large scale burning of these measures, and consequential release of sulfur to the atmosphere. This has led to substantial disruption to the climate system, and is one of the proposed causes of the great dying. Dimethylsulfide [(CH)S or DMS] is produced by the decomposition of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from dying phytoplankton cells in the shallow levels of the ocean, and is the major biogenic gas emitted from the sea, where it is responsible for the distinctive \u201csmell of the sea\u201d along coastlines. DMS is the largest natural source of sulfur gas, but still only has a residence time of about one day in the atmosphere and a majority of it is redeposited in the oceans rather than making it to land.

Along with plants these microbes are responsible for all biological generation of oxygen gas on Earth. Because chloroplasts were derived from a lineage of the Cyanobacteria, the general principles of metabolism in these endosymbionts can also be applied to chloroplasts. In addition to oxygenic photosynthesis, many bacteria can also photosynthesize anaerobically, typically using sulfide () as an electron donor to produce sulfate. Inorganic sulfur (), thiosulfate () and ferrous iron () can also be used by some organisms. Phylogenetically, all oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are Cyanobacteria, while anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria belong to the purple bacteria (Proteobacteria), Green sulfur bacteria (e.g. Chlorobium), Green non-sulfur bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus), or the heliobacteria (Low %G+C Gram positives). In addition to these organisms, some microbes (e.g. the Archaeon \"Halobacterium\" or the bacterium \"Roseobacter\", among others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump. However, there are no known Archaea that carry out photosynthesis.",

Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or \"fixed\", into a usable form to be taken up by plants. Between 5x10 and 10x10 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups. An example of free-living bacteria is \"Azotobacter\". Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as \"Rhizobium\" usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.",

Carbonyl sulfide is the most abundant sulfur compound naturally present in the atmosphere, at , because it is emitted from oceans, volcanoes and deep sea vents. As such, it is a significant compound in the global sulfur cycle. Measurements on the Antarctica ice cores and from air trapped in snow above glaciers (firn air) have provided a detailed picture of OCS concentrations from 1640 to the present day and allow an understanding of the relative importance of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources of this gas to the atmosphere. Some carbonyl sulfide that is transported into the stratospheric sulfate layer is oxidized to sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid forms particulate which affects energy balance due to light scattering. The long atmospheric lifetime of COS makes it the major source of stratospheric sulfate, though sulfur dioxide from volcanic activity can be significant too. Carbonyl sulfide is also removed from the atmosphere by terrestrial vegetation by enzymes associated with the uptake of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, and by hydrolysis in ocean waters. Loss processes, such as these, limit the persistence (or lifetime) of a molecule of COS in the atmosphere to a few years.",

Sulfur oxidation involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide ), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate () to form sulfuric acid (). A classic example of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is \"Beggiatoa\", a microbe originally described by Sergei Winogradsky, one of the founders of environmental microbiology. Another example is \"Paracoccus\". Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed. This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane. Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using reverse electron flow, an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their thermodynamic gradient to produce NADH. Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite () and subsequently converted to sulfate () by the enzyme sulfite oxidase. Some organisms, however, accomplish the same oxidation using a reversal of the APS reductase system used by sulfate-reducing bacteria (see above). In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production. In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. \"Thiobacillus denitrificans\") use nitrate () as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.",

The abundance of CAS in a particular sample depends as much on the circumstances of a particular carbonate rock's formation and diagenetic history as it does on the processes acting on the marine sulfate pool that generated it. Thus, it is important to have both the abundance/concentration of CAS in a sample \"and\" its isotopic composition to understand its place in the marine sulfate record. As mentioned above, different biogeochemical processes produce different isotope effects under equilibrium and disequilibrium conditions: microbial sulfur reduction and sulfur disproportionation can produce equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects of many 10s of per mille. The sulfur isotope composition of the ocean (or a lake, lagoon, or other body) is critical to understanding the extent to which those processes controlled the global sulfur cycle throughout the past. Just as the carbon and oxygen isotope composition of the carbonate host rock can illuminate temperature and local climate history, the sulfur and oxygen isotope composition of CAS can illuminate the cause and effect relationships between that history and the sulfur cycle. Isotopic composition of CAS and carbonate host rock can both be measured by \"elemental analysis\" wherein sulfate or carbonate is \"burned\" or otherwise volatilized and the ionized isotopes are accelerated along a path, the length and duration of which is a function of their masses. The ratio of different isotopes to one another is assessed by comparison to blanks and standards. However, SO, the analyte used in this method, presents some difficulties as the isotopic composition of the component oxygen may also vary, affecting the mass measurement. SO can also \"stick\" to or react with other compounds in the mass spectrometer line. Thus, if high precision is needed, sulfate samples are reduced to sulfides, which are then fluorinated to produce the inert and stable-isotopologue-free compound SF, which can be passed through a specialized mass spectrometer. These methods, mass spectrometry and clumped isotope mass spectrometry, are discussed in greater detail in their primary articles. (de Groot 2008, Paris et al. 2013, 2014a, Present et al. 2015).",
