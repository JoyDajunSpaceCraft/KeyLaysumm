Mammals possess this system, which begins in the kidneys where the developmental signal is manufactured. The developmental signal, also called a cytokine, is erythropoietin in this case. (Cytokines are key regulators of hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation.) Erythropoietin's activity is initiated when hematopoietic cytokine receptors become activated. In erythrocyte regulation, erythropoietin is a protein containing 165 amino acids that plays a role in activating the cytoplasmic protein kinase JAK. The results of some newer research have also indicated that the aforementioned cytokine receptors function with members of the JAK tyrosine kinase family. The cytokine receptors activate the JAK kinases. This then results in the phosphorylation of several signaling proteins located in the cell membrane. This subsequently affects both the stimulation of ligand-mediated receptors and intracellular signaling pathway activation. Substrates for JAK kinases mediate some gene responses and more. The process is also responsible for mediating the production of blood cells. In this case, erythropoietin binds to the corresponding plasma membrane receptor, dimerizing the receptor. The dimer is responsible for activating the kinase JAK via binding. Tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor are consequently phosphorylated by the activated protein kinase JAK. Overall, this is also how a receptor tyrosine kinase might be activated by a ligand to regulate erythrocyte formation.",

            "document": "Reduced muscle mass, strength and performance in space . As presented above, skeletal muscle atrophy involves an imbalance between the processes that control protein synthesis (also known as protein translation) and those that control protein breakdown. When the two processes are in synchrony, muscle mass is stable. However, if there is an imbalance such that the protein synthetic pathway is decreased relative to that of the rate of degradation, muscle atrophy will occur. In the case of skeletal muscle atrophy in response to spaceflight or HS, a decrease in the capacity for synthesis as well as an increase in the processes that regulate degradation seem to occur, creating a rapid net degradation response to the unloading stimulus. On the basis of the available information, such a scenario is thought to involve the following chain of events. At the onset of unloading involving a wide range of models including spaceflight, a decrease in transcriptional and/or pre-translational activity occurs in skeletal muscle that affects the type I and IIa MHC genes as well as the actin gene. This results in a reduced level of both pre-mRNA and mRNA pools (the latter being a substrate for protein translation) for these three proteins. Together, MHC and actin provide the bulk of the myofibril fraction that accounts for most of the protein in the muscle cell. Concomitantly, a decrease occurs in the activity of key protein kinase enzyme systems (constituting the PI3kinase/akt/mTOR pathway), which regulates the protein synthetic apparatus controlling protein translation. This alteration, in combination with a smaller amount of mRNA substrate, collectively contributes to a reduction in the net capacity for protein synthesis. Occurring simultaneously with this process is the up-regulation of a set of genes that encode proteins that play a regulatory role in augmenting protein degradation. These include the myostatin gene, the atrogin 1 gene, and a gene called muscle ring finger protein, referred to as MURF. Myostatin is an antigrowth transcription factor, which is thought to negatively modulate the genes that promote growth. Atrogin and MURF are E3 ligases that are responsible for ubiquinating target proteins to mark them for degradation in a system designated as the proteasome. Interestingly, this MURF protein has been reported to be a key regulator for specifically targeting breakdown of the type I and type IIa MHC proteins.",

Cullin-7 acts as scaffold protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The role of this complex is to tag damaged and excess proteins in the cell with ubiquitin. Intracellular and extracellular signals within the cell highly regulate when and which proteins are tagged with ubiquitin. Once attached to the protein, ubiquitin serves as a signaling molecule to the proteasomes, which then bind to the ubiquinated proteins and degrades them. This ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by breaking down unwanted proteins. Additionally, the system regulates the level of proteins involved in critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. Mutations in the CUL7 gene blocks the ability of the cullin-7 protein to bring together the components of this E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This leads to impaired ubiquination and hence the aggregation of damaged, misfolded, and excess proteins. Disruption of the protein degradation process plays a role in the pathogensis of prenatal growth retardation in humans, a key feature of 3-M syndrome. The skeletal abnormalities that are present in individuals with this disorder suggests that this gene may play a role in the endochondral ossification process.

While research on these binding proteins is relatively recent, their function has been shown to have vital roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, inflammation, and immunity in various cells, but specifically hepatocytes, adipocytes, and hematopoietic cells. For example, in adipocytes, this has been shown in a variety of experiments with mice: ectopic expression of these C/EBPs (C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b2) were able to initiate the differentiation programs of the cell, even in the absence of adipogenic hormones, or the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes (or fat cells). In addition, an overabundance of these C/EBPs (specifically, C/EBP\u03b4) causes an accelerated response. And furthermore, in cells lacking C/EBP or in C/EBP-deficient mice, both are unable to undergo adipogenesis. This results in the mice dying from hypoglycemia, or the reduced lipid accumulation in adipose tissue. The C/EBPs follow a general basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain at the C-terminus and are able to form dimers with other C/EBPs or other transcription factors.

The main goal of biochemical cascades in lymphocytes is the secretion of molecules that can suppress altered cells or eliminate pathogenic agents, through proliferation, differentiation and activation of these cells. Therefore, the antigenic receptors play a central role in signal transduction in lymphocytes, because when antigens interact with them lead to a cascade of signal events. These receptors, that recognize the antigen soluble (B cells) or linked to a molecule on Antigen Presenting Cells (T cells), don't have long cytoplasm tails, so they are anchored to signal proteins, which contain a long cytoplasmic tails with a motif that can be phosphorylated (ITAM \u2013 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and resulting in different signal pathways. The antigen receptor and signal protein form a stable complex, named BCR or TCR, in B or T cells, respectively. The family Src is essential for signal transduction in these cells, because it's responsible for phosphorylation of ITAMs. Therefore, Lyn and Lck, in lymphocytes B and T, respectively, phosphorylate ITAMs after the antigen recognition and the conformational change of the receptor, which leads to the binding of Syk/Zap-70 kinases to ITAM and its activation. Syk kinase is specific of lymphocytes B and Zap-70 is present in T cells. After activation of these enzymes, some adaptor proteins are phosphorylated, like BLNK (B cells) and LAT (T cells). These proteins after phosphorylation become activated and allow binding of others enzymes that continue the biochemical cascade. One example of a protein that binds to adaptor proteins and become activated is PLC that is very important in the lymphocyte signal pathways. PLC is responsible for PKC activation, via DAG and Ca, which leads to phosphorylation of CARMA1 molecule, and formation of CBM complex. This complex activates I\u03ba\u03ba kinase, which phosphorylates I-\u03baB, and then allows the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and transcription of genes encoding cytokines, for example. Others transcriptional factors like NFAT and AP1 complex are also important for transcription of cytokines. The differentiation of B cells to plasma cells is also an example of a signal mechanism in lymphocytes, induced by a cytokine receptor. In this case, some interleukins bind to a specific receptor, which leads to activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. Consequently, the BLIMP1 protein is translated and inhibits PAX5, allowing immunoglobulin genes transcription and activation of XBP1 (important for the secretory apparatus formation and enhancing of protein synthesis). Also, the coreceptors (CD28/CD19) play an important role because they can improve the antigen/receptor binding and initiate parallel cascade events, like activation o PI3 Kinase. PIP3 then is responsible for activation of several proteins, like vav (leads to activation of JNK pathway, which consequently leads to activation of c-Jun) and btk (can also activate PLC).",

Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell.

EP is classified as a relaxant type of prostaglandin receptor based on its ability, upon activation, to relax the contraction of certain smooth muscle preparations and smooth muscle-containing tissues that have been pre-contracted by stimulation. When bound to PGE or other of its agonists, it mobilizes G proteins containing the Gs alpha subunit (i.e. G\u03b1)-G beta-gammaes (i.e. G) complex. The complex then dissociate into its G\u03b1 and G components which act to regulate cell signaling pathways. In particular, G\u03b1 stimulates adenyl cyclase to raise cellular levels of cAMP; cAMP activates PKA, a kinase which in turn activates signaling molecules, in particular, the transcription factor, CREB. Activated CREB stimulates the expression of genes such as c-fos, somatostatin, and corticotropin-releasing hormone that regulate cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, cellular survival, and angiogenesis. EP activation of G proteins also activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR, ERK, and p38 MARK pathways. Activation of ERK induces expression of EGR1, a transcription factor which controls transcription of genes involved in cellular differentiation and mitogenesis. EP also interacts with Prostaglandin E receptor 4-associated protein (EPRAP) to inhibit phosphorylation of the proteasome protein, p105, thereby suppressing a cells ability to activate nuclear factor kappa B, a transcription factor that controls genes coding for cytokines and other elements that regulate inflammation, cell growth, and cell survival (see NF-\u03baB#Structure). The activation of these pathways lead to variety of different types of functional responses depending on cell type, the pathways available in different cell types, and numerous other factors; EP activation may therefore have diverse effects on cell function depending on these factors.

Following its activation, EP undergoes homologous desensitization. That is, EP becomes insensitive to further activation and internalizes.

Among others, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the reduced concentration of PD1 and by the increased concentration of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b242) that is responsible for the formation of senile plaques and also induces inflammation and apoptosis in neuronal tissues. A\u03b242 is generated by the enzymatic cleavage of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2\u0391PP) through \u03b2- and \u03b3- secretases. Like other pro-inflammatory mediators, A\u03b242 induces inflammation through the activation of the pro-inflammatory enzyme COX-2 and the release of prostaglandins. Moreover, the release of A\u03b242 down-regulates the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x and up-regulates the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad that ultimately lead to the formation of the apoptosome.

The APC protein helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, how the cell polarizes and the morphogenesis of the 3D structures, or whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the chromosome number in cells produced through cell division is correct. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. The activity of one protein in particular, beta-catenin, is controlled by the APC protein (see: Wnt signaling pathway). Regulation of beta-catenin prevents genes that stimulate cell division from being turned on too often and prevents cell overgrowth.",

His early work focused on the association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the BB rat to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. He focused much of his research in the next decade on the regulation of MHC gene expression. He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression. His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos. This has turned out to be relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs. This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport. NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin.

This pathway involves changes of protein\u2013protein interactions inside the cell, induced by an external signal. Many growth factors bind to receptors at the cell surface and stimulate cells to progress through the cell cycle and divide. Several of these receptors are kinases that start to phosphorylate themselves and other proteins when binding to a ligand. This phosphorylation can generate a binding site for a different protein and thus induce protein\u2013protein interaction. In Figure 3, the ligand (called epidermal growth factor (EGF)) binds to the receptor (called EGFR). This activates the receptor to phosphorylate itself. The phosphorylated receptor binds to an adaptor protein (GRB2), which couples the signal to further downstream signaling processes. For example, one of the signal transduction pathways that are activated is called the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The signal transduction component labeled as \"MAPK\" in the pathway was originally called \"ERK,\" so the pathway is called the MAPK/ERK pathway. The MAPK protein is an enzyme, a protein kinase that can attach phosphate to target proteins such as the transcription factor MYC and, thus, alter gene transcription and, ultimately, cell cycle progression.

The two contradicting sides on this subject remained ambiguous and undefined throughout the course of NDPK studies. However, recent experiments began to show evidence for NM23 being a suppressor of metastasis. Nme2 was tagged as an anti-metastasis gene, using the tissue chip technology and immunohistochemistry. When Nme2 gene products were over-produced in gastric cancer cells, there was a decrease in proliferation, migration, and invasion of such cancer cells. The cell cultures revealed that Nme2 impacts gastric cancer cells, but the question still remains about what regulates Nme2 activities among various cancer types. Nme1 was found in great number in poorly metastatic sublines of melanoma cells. Also, the transfection of Nme1 into a highly metastatic melanoma line significantly reduced metastasis. This theory has been tested with mice as well; the Nme1-deficient mice formed greater lung metastases than wild type mice, showing that this gene has suppressing activity. Invasion of cancer occurs due to changes in cell adhesion and it is caused by gene expression changes in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Surprisingly, there are many adhesion molecules, motility factors, signaling pathways, proteolytic events, EMT hallmarks, and other transcriptional programs that have been linked to the Nme1 proteins.

In atherosclerosis, an underlying cause of Coronary artery disease and strokes, atheromatous plaques accumulate in the vascular tunica intima thereby narrowing blood vessel size and decreasing blood flow. In an animal model and in humans 13-HODE (primarily esterified to cholesterol, phospholipids, and possibly other lipids) is a dominant component of these plaques. Since these studies found that early into the progression of the plaques, 13-HODE consisted primarily of the \"S\" stereoisomer while more mature plaques contained equal amounts of \"S\" and \"R\" stereoisomers, it was suggested that 15-LOX-1 contributes to early accumulation while cytochrome and/or free radical pathways contributes to the later accumulation of the plaques. Further studies suggest that 13(\"S\")-HODE contributes to plaque formation by activating the transcription factor, PPAR\u03b3 (13(\"R\")-HODE lacks this ability), which in turn stimulates the production of two receptors on the surface of macrophages resident in the plaques, 1) CD36, a scavenger receptor for oxidized low density lipoproteins, native lipoproteins, oxidized phospholipids, and long-chain fatty acids, and 2) adipocyte protein 2 (aP2), a fatty acid binding protein; this may cause macrophages to increase their uptake of these lipids, transition to lipid-laden foam cells, and thereby increase plaque size. The 13(\"S\")-HODE/PPAR\u03b3 axis also causes macrophages to self-destruct by activating apoptosis-inducing pathways;, this effect may also contribute to increases in plaque size. These studies suggest that 13-HODE-producing metabolic pathways, PPAR\u03b3, CD36, and aP2 may be therapeutic targets for treating atherosclerosis-related diseases. Indeed, Statins, which are known to suppress cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting an enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase HMG-CoA reductase, are widely used to prevent atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis-related diseases.

Because heterodimerization is a prerequisite for DNA binding, factors that interfere with dimerization effectively act as passive repressors of proneural gene activity. Proneural proteins specifically bind DNA sequences that contain a core hexanucleotide motif, CANNTG, known as an E-box. The basic region and helix 1 of the bHLH domain form a long alpha-helix that is connected with the loop region to helix 2. Direct contacts between bHLH residues and DNA are responsible for the common ability of neural bHLH proteins to bind to the core E-boxsequence. The cells within a cluster that express a proneural gene (called a proneural cluster) can be thought of as cells of an equivalence group. Within a proneural cluster, the cells compete with each other, such that only a subset of cells is singled out to develop into neuronal precursors. This singling out process is mediated by cell-cell interactions interpreted through the action of neurogenic genes. In neuroectoderm, neurogenic genes are required to single out cells from within proneural clusters to form neuronal precursors, leaving the remaining cells of proneural clusters to develop into epidermal cells. Proneural genes may function in analogous fashions in vertebrates and invertebrates, specifically they were implicated in early neurogenesis. Although proneural proteins are responsible for trigger neurogenesis, different proteins are required for different neural and/or glial cell types. This implies that each of these proteins is capable of regulating both common target genes for neurogenesis and unique target genes for neuronal subtype characteristics. Proneural bHLH transcription factors, not only drive neurogenesis by activating the expression of a cascade of neuronal genes, but they inhibit the expression of glial genes. Neural bHLH genes have different functions depending on: the sensitivity to lateral inhibition, which determines if a cell becomes epidermal or neuronal, and whether the gene is expressed in the CNS before or after the terminal mitosis.",

It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a methylase domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in methylation state of DNA in that region will subsequently result. Transcription rates of genes so-affected will be reduced. Many of the effector domains function to modulate either the DNA directly - e.g. via methylation, cleaving, or recombination of the target DNA sequence - or by modulating its transcription rate - e.g. inhibiting transcription via repressor domains that block transcriptional machinery, promoting transcription with activation domains that recruit transcriptional machinery to the site, or histone- or other epigenetic-modification domains that affect chromatin state and the ability of transcriptional machinery to access the affected genes. Epigenetic modification is a major theme in determining varying expression levels for genes, as explained by the idea that how tightly-wound the DNA strand is - from histones at the local level up to chromatin at the chromosomal level - can influence the accessibility of sequences of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing the rate at which it can be transcribed. If, instead of impacting the DNA strand directly, as described above, a designer zinc-finger protein instead affects epigenetic modification state for a target DNA region, modulation of gene expression could similarly be accomplished. In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression in vivo, Choo \"et al\" designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. This specific oncogene is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The oncogene typically enables leukemia cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of cancer. By including a nuclear localization signal with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo \"et al\" were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo.

Obesity has been found to contribute to approximately 55% of cases of type\u00a02 diabetes; chronic obesity leads to increased insulin resistance that can develop into type 2 diabetes, most likely because adipose tissue (especially that in the abdomen around internal organs) is a source of several chemical signals, hormones and cytokines, to other tissues. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 may activate the NF-\u03baB pathway which has been linked to the development of insulin resistance. Gene expression promoted by a diet of fat and glucose, as well as high levels of inflammation related cytokines found in the obese, can result in cells that \"produce fewer and smaller mitochondria than is normal,\" and are thus prone to insulin resistance. Fat tissue has also been shown to be involved in managing much of the body's response to insulin and control of uptake of sugar. It secretes RBP4 which increases insulin resistance by blocking the action of insulin in muscle and liver. Fat cells also secrete adiponectin which acts in an opposite way to RBP4 by improving the action of insulin, however, engorged fat cells secrete it in lower amount than normal fat cells. The obese therefore may have higher level of RBP4 but lower level of adiponectin, both of which increase the risk of developing diabetes.",

Numerous studies have investigated the link between birth weight and risk of disease and have found that low birth weight is significantly associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and type-2 diabetes. Most importantly, these associations occurred after adjusting for lifestyle factors, implying a genetic basis for onset of disease. Impaired insulin secretion is associated with low birth weight and can lead to insulin resistance as babies accumulate body fat. Studies using intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) rats have found that growth inhibition can lead to decreased expression of Pdx1 transcription factor, which is essential for differentiation and function of pancreatic beta cells. Decreased histone acetylation at the proximal promoter of Pdx1 is responsible for reduced Pdx1 expression and subsequently results in a cascade of histone deacetylation and methylation events that can result in type-2 diabetes. Obesity during pregnancy and high-fat maternal diets both show strong associations with obesity in offspring. As the number of overweight reproductive-age women increases, the number of overweight children and infants also increases. It has been postulated that maternal obesity causes an accumulation of fat in fetal adipose tissue (adiposity) and predisposes babies for obesity in childhood and adulthood. Animal studies have shown that maternal overnutrition may impact brain development and cause disruptions to programming of the hypothalamus. Offspring that were exposed to a high-fat or high-caloric maternal diet had increased levels of insulin, glucose and leptin. It is hypothesized that these elevations are due to disturbances in the complex neuronal network that includes the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) pathways. This altered neuronal signaling can consequently impact food-intake behavior and lead to diet-induced obesity in adulthood. While epigenetic modifications are most likely involved in the development of obesity, the specific target genes have yet to be identified. Genes involved in adipogenesis, such as fibroblast growth-factor-2, phosphatase and tensin homologue, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and oestrogen receptor-alpha, possess multiple CpG islands in their promoter sites and may act as epigenetic targets. Furthermore, it has been shown that prenatal exposure to a hypomethylating agent, such as bisphenol A (BPA), is associated with increased body weight and suggests modified DNA methylation as a mechanism for increasing susceptibility to obesity.",

Cullin-7 acts as scaffold protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The role of this complex is to tag damaged and excess proteins in the cell with ubiquitin. Intracellular and extracellular signals within the cell highly regulate when and which proteins are tagged with ubiquitin. Once attached to the protein, ubiquitin serves as a signaling molecule to the proteasomes, which then bind to the ubiquinated proteins and degrades them. This ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by breaking down unwanted proteins. Additionally, the system regulates the level of proteins involved in critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. Mutations in the CUL7 gene blocks the ability of the cullin-7 protein to bring together the components of this E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This leads to impaired ubiquination and hence the aggregation of damaged, misfolded, and excess proteins. Disruption of the protein degradation process plays a role in the pathogensis of prenatal growth retardation in humans, a key feature of 3-M syndrome. The skeletal abnormalities that are present in individuals with this disorder suggests that this gene may play a role in the endochondral ossification process.

Through collaborations with her ex-husband Matthew Rodheffer, who is also affiliated with Yale University, Horsley has been researching the role of adipocytes, or fat cells, in hair grow. She found that within epithelial tissues, cells tend to confine to distinct micro-environments. These environments regulate cell activity with the use of adhesion between cells and various signaling molecules that were formerly unknown. Horsley and Rodheffer discovered the source of both fat cells and immune cells as local signals, as the hormone signal, prolactin, is responsible for stem cell activity and the regeneration of skin cells. Together, they also found that cell differentiation of adipocytes and hair growth occur simultaneously, and when the cell differentiation process (adipogenesis) ceases, hair growth stops and the follicles deteriorate. They identified specific adipose progenitors in the skin, which indicated the necessity of these cells to sufficiently induce hair follicle growth. These cells are activated after injury and are required for fibroblast migration during the wound healing process. Finally, they discovered that aging causes the loss of dermal adipocyte precursor cells regeneration, and therefore requires Pdgf signaling.

Increased levels of fat in the body and blood raises blood pressure, increases cholesterol, and causes arteriosclerosis; all of which are severely dangerous vascular complications for patients suffering from diabetes and can lead to death. The epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and the Polycomb group of proteins such as Bmi-1, the H3K27me3 transferase Ezh2, its demethylase JMJD3, and the H3K4me3 transferase MLL were shown to be regulators in the expression of tumour suppressor p16INK4a in \u03b2-cell proliferation and regeneration. Post-translational modifications of histones (H3K4me2 and H3K9me2), H3K4 demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), and an H3K9me2 methyltransferase SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) were also implicated in diabetes related adipogenesis. The inflammatory response arises from vascular tissues and specialized white blood cells, and a persistent state of inflammation under diabetic stress leads to clots and vascular deterioration. Patients suffer edema, aneurysms, and injuries that cannot heal properly because the vascular system is unable to respond properly when under epigenetic influences. Diabetes and the associated hyperglycemia can lead to production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and growth factors. Together, they activate multiple signal transduction pathways including oxidant stress, tyrosine kinases, PKC, and MAPKs leading to activation of transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, and dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms including HKme, histone lysine acetylation, and DNA methylation via the action of corresponding methyltransferases, demethylases, acetylases, and deacetylases. This leads to higher accessibility of pathological gene expression products and activation of pathological genes. Being in this state of diabetic stress leads to long term metabolic memory and altered epigenome with adverse side effects on the cardiovascular system. Oxidized Low-density lipoprotein-induced chemokine expression was associated with H3KAc and phosphorylation, and recruitment of HATs along with NF-\u03baB in endothelial cells, and these were reversed by pre-treatment with statins. Studies show alterations in histone modification patterns, along with changes in expression of the corresponding Histone methyltransferases, in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells from aortas of adult mice exposed to hypercholesterolaemia. Studies in monocytes, white blood cells that travel along vascular surfaces, showed that H3K9/14Ac and HATs CBP/p300, H3R17me and its methyltransferase CARM1, play key roles in inflammatory gene expression. HDACs also played key roles in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory gene expression in monocytes and macrophages.

While research on these binding proteins is relatively recent, their function has been shown to have vital roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, inflammation, and immunity in various cells, but specifically hepatocytes, adipocytes, and hematopoietic cells. For example, in adipocytes, this has been shown in a variety of experiments with mice: ectopic expression of these C/EBPs (C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b2) were able to initiate the differentiation programs of the cell, even in the absence of adipogenic hormones, or the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes (or fat cells). In addition, an overabundance of these C/EBPs (specifically, C/EBP\u03b4) causes an accelerated response. And furthermore, in cells lacking C/EBP or in C/EBP-deficient mice, both are unable to undergo adipogenesis. This results in the mice dying from hypoglycemia, or the reduced lipid accumulation in adipose tissue.

Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell.

There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as p-glycoprotein, in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on p-glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of p-glycoprotein are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult. Another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification, a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.",

Fat tissue is an active body organ involved in many processes critical to human health,8 including: (1) promotion of blood vessel formation (angiogenesis); (2) fat cell recruitment and development adipogenesis; (3) dissolving and reforming the structures around fat tissue (extracellular matrix); (4) generation, storage and release of fat; (5) growth factor production; (6) glucose metabolism; (6) production of factors that affect blood pressure (such as those associated with the renin\u2013angiotensin system); (7) fat and cholesterol metabolism; (8) enzyme production; (9) hormone production; (10) steroid metabolism; (11) blood clotting (hemostasis); (12) element binding; (13) and immune response (described below). When fat cells and fat tissue remain healthy during fat weight gain, patients may avoid metabolic ill health. However, if enlargement of fat cells and fat tissue causes them to become \"sick\", then important fat tissue functions are disrupted, and deranged responses contribute to metabolic disease. When excessive body weight leads to adiposopathy, this represents a hormone or endocrine disease. Additionally, fat cells and fat tissue also produce many different types of immune factors. Inflammation is a contributing cause to metabolic disease, and the ultimate contribution of fat tissue to inflammation is determined by the production of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. From a pro-inflammatory standpoint, fat tissue (which includes fat cells and other cells, such as immune cells) produces factors including: (1) adipokines with cytokine activity such as leptin, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; (2) acute phase proteins / reactants such as C-reactive protein; (3) adipokines of the alternative complement system; (4) chemotactic/chemoattractant adipokines; and prostaglandins (eicosanoids). From an anti-inflammatory standpoint, fat tissue produces various anti-inflammatory factors with the most commonly described being adiponectin. If fat cells or fat tissue becomes \"sick\", then the release of too many pro-inflammatory factors and a decrease in too many anti-inflammatory factors often result in a net pro-inflammatory response can contribute to metabolic disease.",

            "document": "Sociogenomics . The 23 pairs of DNA molecules called chromosomes contain the approximately 21,000 genes comprising the \u201chuman blueprint.\u201d For this blueprint to have any biological affect however, it must be transcribed to RNA and then into proteins. This process of translation, or \u201cturning on\u201d of a gene to its final gene products is termed gene expression. Genetic expression is far from random, allowing the differentiation and specialization of different cell types with identical genomes. Transcription factors are the proteins which control gene expression, and they can either increase (i.e. an activator) or decrease (i.e. a repressor) expression. Multiple transcription factors exist that are responsive to the internal environment of the cell (e.g. to maintain cell differentiation), but several also appear to be responsive to external factors including several hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. The sum total of genes expressed into RNA in a particular population of cells is referred to as the transcriptome.",
