When a cell is under stress, it naturally increases the production of stress proteins, including heat shock proteins such as HSP60.

In recent research \u201cit has emerged that\u2026chaperonin 60 can be found on the surface of various prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and can even be released from cells\u201d. According to recent research, many different types of heat shock proteins are used in immune response signaling, but it appears that different proteins act and respond differently to other signaling molecules. HSP60 has been shown to be released from specific cells like peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) when there are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or GroEL present. This suggests that the cell has different receptors and responses to human and bacterial HSP60. In addition, it has been shown that HSP60 has the capability \u201cof activating monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells\u2026and also of inducing secretion of a wide range of cytokines.\u201d The fact that HSP60 responds to other signal molecules like LPS or GroEL and has the ability to activate certain types of cells supports the idea that HSP60 is part of a danger signal cascade which is involved in activating an immune response.",

            "document": "Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody . Although the pathogenic role of ANCA is still controversial, \"in vitro\" and animal models support the idea that the antibodies have a direct pathological role in the formation of small vessel vasculitides. MPO and PR3 specific ANCA can activate neutrophils and monocytes through their Fc and Fab'2 receptors, which can be enhanced by cytokines which cause neutrophils to display MPO and PR3 on their surface. Aberrant glycosylation of the MPO and PR3 specific ANCA enhances their ability to interact with activating Fc receptors on neutrophils. The activated neutrophils can then adhere to endothelial cells where degranulation occurs. This releases free oxygen radicals and lytic enzymes, resulting in damage to the endothelium via the induction of necrosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, neutrophils release chemoattractive signalling molecules that recruit more neutrophils to the endothelium, acting as a positive feedback loop. Animal models have shown that MPO antibodies can induce necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and systemic small vessel vasculitis. In these animal models the formation of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis can occur in the absence of T-cells, however neutrophils must be present. Although the direct pathogenic role of ANCA is the most accepted theory to date of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) pathogenesis, the theory still fails to explain the observation that ANCA serum concentration does not always correlate disease activity or relapses, where high ANCA titres can be found in patients, and in some normal individuals, with no sign of vasculitis. In addition, in patients with active disease, treated with Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody which remove circulating B-cells, clinical remission correlates more to the decreasing number of circulating B-cells than decrease in ANCA titre, which in some patient does not change during treatment. The same study found that clinical relapse in some patients were in association with the return of circulating B-cells. Based on the above observations and that ANCA reactive B-cells can be found in circulation in patients with AAV, an alternative hypothesis have been proposed assigning a direct pathogenic role of these cells, whereby activated neutrophils and ANCA-reactive B-cells engage in intercellular cross-talk, which leads not only to neutrophil degranulation and inflammation but also to the proliferation and differentiation of ANCA-reactive B-cells. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested.",

When red blood cells reach the end of their life due to aging or defects, they are removed from the circulation by the phagocytic activity of macrophages in the spleen or the liver or hemolyze within the circulation. Free hemoglobin is then cleared from the circulation via the hemoglobin transporter CD163, which is exclusively expressed on monocytes or macrophages. Within these cells the hemoglobin molecule is broken up, and the iron gets recycled. This process also produces one molecule of carbon monoxide for every molecule of heme degraded. Heme degradation is one of the few natural sources of carbon monoxide in the human body, and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon monoxide even in people breathing pure air. The other major final product of heme degradation is bilirubin. Increased levels of this chemical are detected in the blood if red blood cells are being destroyed more rapidly than usual. Improperly degraded hemoglobin protein or hemoglobin that has been released from the blood cells too rapidly can clog small blood vessels, especially the delicate blood filtering vessels of the kidneys, causing kidney damage. Iron is removed from heme and salvaged for later use, it is stored as hemosiderin or ferritin in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as transferrins. When the porphyrin ring is broken up, the fragments are normally secreted as a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which is secreted into the intestines as bile. Intestines metabolise bilirubin into urobilinogen. Urobilinogen leaves the body in faeces, in a pigment called stercobilin. Globulin is metabolised into amino acids that are then released into circulation.",

            "document": "Chemical biology . Small molecules that modulate stem-cell behavior are commonly identified in high-throughput screens. Libraries of compounds are screened for the induction of a desired phenotypic change in cultured stem-cells. This is usually observed through activation or repression of a fluorescent reporter or by detection of specific cell surface markers by FACS or immunohistochemistry. Hits are then structurally optimized for activity by the synthesis and screening of secondary libraries. The cellular targets of the small molecule can then be identified by affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry, or DNA microarray.  A trademark of pluripotent stem-cells, such as embryonic stem-cells (ESCs), is the ability to self-renew indefinitely. The conventional use of feeder cells and various exogenous growth factors in the culture of ESCs presents a problem in that the resulting highly variable culture conditions make the long-term expansion of un-differentiated ESCs challenging. Ideally, chemically defined culture conditions could be developed to maintain ESCs in a pluripotent state indefinitely. Toward this goal, the Schultz and Ding labs at the Scripps Research Institute identified a small molecule that can preserve the long-term self-renewal of ESCs in the absence of feeder cells and other exogenous growth factors. This novel molecule, called pluripotin, was found to simultaneously inhibit multiple differentiation inducing pathways. The utility of stem-cells is in their ability to differentiate into all cell types that make up an organism. Differentiation can be achieved in vitro by favoring development toward a particular cell type through the addition of lineage specific growth factors, but this process is typically non-specific and generates low yields of the desired phenotype. Alternatively, inducing differentiation by small molecules is advantageous in that it allows for the development of completely chemically defined conditions for the generation of one specific cell type. A small molecule, neuropathiazol, has been identified which can specifically direct differentiation of multipotent neural stem cells into neurons. Neuropathiazol is so potent that neurons develop even in conditions that normally favor the formation of glial cells, a powerful demonstration of controlling differentiation by chemical means. Because of the ethical issues surrounding ESC research, the generation of pluripotent cells by reprogramming existing somatic cells into a more \"stem-like\" state is a promising alternative to the use of standard ESCs. By genetic approaches, this has recently been achieved in the creation of ESCs by somatic cell nuclear transfer and the generation of induced pluripotent stem-cells by viral transduction of specific genes. From a therapeutic perspective, reprogramming by chemical means would be safer than genetic methods because induced stem-cells would be free of potentially dangerous transgenes. Several examples of small molecules that can de-differentiate somatic cells have been identified. In one report, lineage-committed myoblasts were treated with a compound, named reversine, and observed to revert to a more stem-like phenotype. These cells were then shown to be capable of differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes under appropriate conditions. Stem-cell therapies are currently the most promising treatment for many degenerative diseases. Chemical approaches to stem-cell biology support the development of cell-based therapies by enhancing stem-cell growth, maintenance, and differentiation in vitro. Small molecules that have been shown to modulate stem-cell fate are potential therapeutic candidates and provide a natural lean-in to pre-clinical drug development. Small molecule drugs could promote endogenous stem-cells to differentiate, replacing previously damaged tissues and thereby enhancing the body's own regenerative ability. Further investigation of molecules that modulate stem-cell behavior will only unveil new therapeutic targets.",

The production and activities of the SPM suggest a new view of inflammation wherein the initial response to foreign organisms, tissue injury, or other insults involves numerous soluble cell signaling molecules that not only recruit various cell types to promote inflammation but concurrently cause these cells to produce SPM which feed back on their parent and other cells to dampen their pro-inflammatory activity and to promote repair. Resolution of an inflammatory response is thus an active rather than self-limiting process which is set into motion at least in part by the initiating pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin D2) which instruct relevant cells to produce SPM and to assume a more anti-inflammatory phenotype. Resolution of the normal inflammatory response, then, may involve switching production of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory PUFA metabolites. Excessive inflammatory responses to insult as well as many pathological inflammatory responses that contribute to diverse diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Inflammatory bowel disease, etc. (see Inflammation#Inflammatory disorders) may reflect, in part, a failure in this class switching. Diseases caused or worsened by non-adaptive inflammatory responses may by amenable to treatment with SPM or synthetic SPM which, unlike natural SPM, resist in vivo metabolic inactivation.

            "document": "AOC3 . Membrane-bound VAP-1 releases an active, soluble form of the protein, which may be conducive to increased inflammation and the progression of many vascular disorders. In particular, elevation of VAP-1 activity and the increased enzymatic-mediated deamination is proposed to play a role in renal and vascular disease, oxidative stress, acute and chronic hyperglycemia, and diabetes complications. In diabetic patients, the amine oxidase activity stimulates glucose uptake via translocation of transporters to the cell membrane in adipocytes and smooth muscle cells. This modifies hepatic glucose homeostasis and may contribute to patterns of GLUT expression in chronic disease, as insulin resistance in humans have been linked to altered expression of GLUT isoforms by granulosa cells and adipose tissues. In particular, hydrogen peroxide, released during the deamination of SSAO, acts as a signal-transducing molecule, affecting GLUT1 and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane by granulosa cells and adipose tissue. This mimics insulin and interferes with cell processes in diabetic patients. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide, along with aldehydes and glucose, is involved in generating advanced glycation end-products and oxidative stress, which leads to the development of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside arteries. Cell processes involved in insulin resistance are often associated with elevated VAP-1 expression and modified GLUT expression in patients with liver diseases. Accordingly, subjects with diabetes are often at an increased risk for the development of and mortality from various cancers, including colorectal cancer hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of hyperinsulinemia - the increased bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors-1 and hypoadiponectinemia - diabetic patients have a greater chance of developing oncogenesis and tumor progression. In one study, serum VAP-1 was shown to independently predict 10-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer-related mortality in subjects with type 2 diabetes. This may be because VAP-1 is involved in binding TIL, lymphokine-activated killer cells, and natural killer cells to the vasculature of cancer tissue. Hence, increased serum VAP-1 activity has been repeatedly found to be associated with various vascular disorders, such as the complications of diabetes mellitus, acute and chronic hyperglycemia, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. The same elevation is seen in kidney disease, even when accounted for factors of age, gender, and smoking. Studies have established a strong correlation between serum VAP-1 levels and urinary albumin excretion, which supports the idea that VAP-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of kidney damage in humans. In renal pathology, the aldehydes produced by SSAO are highly reactive and lead to the formation of protein cross-linking and oxidative stress. Additionally, VAP-1 mediates leukocyte migration and, eventually, can lead to chronic inflammatory cell accumulation and the development of kidney fibrosis. As for stroke patients, the products from deamination induce cytotoxicity protein cross-linking and amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) aggregation along with oxidative stress and thus are considered a potential risk factor for stress-related angiopathy. In these patients, VAP-1 may be involved in increasing vascular damage due to increased susceptibility of endothelial cells to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). In hemorrhagic stroke patients, plasmatic VAP-1 activity is increase, and in ischemic stroke patients, it can predict the appearance of parenchymal hemorrhages after tissue plasminogen activator treatment due to the transmigration of inflammatory cells into ischaemic brain. VAP-1-expression is increased in blood vessels of ischemic areas where it may be mediating neutrophil adhesion to vascular endothelium in ischemic heart. The presence of diminished expression of vascular VAP-1 in infarcted brain areas and the increased concentration of VAP-1 in serum suggests that acute cerebral ischaemia triggers early release of endothelial VAP-1 from brain vasculature. Lastly, during pulmonary infection and airway hyper-activity,VAP-1 may also contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the transfer of neutrophils from the microvasculature. Inhibitors of VAP-1 may be effective in reducing inflammation in various vascular diseases, but more studies are needed to understand to what extent. Whether serum VAP-1 is a good biomarker for these diseases requires further investigation. Although many studies concerning VAP-1 as a therapeutic target are becoming more frequent, it is difficult to study VAP-1 in cell or tissue systems, since the enzyme progressively loses its expression, and immortalized cell lines do not show any expression at all.",

CD97 antibodies and lack of CD97 or CD55 in mice reduced synovial inflammation and joint damage in collagen- and K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis. In brain tissue, CD97 is undetectable in normal white matter, and expression of CD55 is fairly restricted to the endothelium. In pre-active lesion, increased expression of CD55 in endothelial cells and robust CD97 expression on infiltrating leukocytes suggest a possible role of both molecules in immune cell migration through the blood-brain barrier.

The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids or EETs are signaling molecules formed within various types of cells by the metabolism of arachidonic acid by a specific subset of Cytochrome P450 enzymes termed cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. These nonclassic eicosanoids are generally short-lived, being rapidly converted from epoxides to less active or inactive dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acids (diHETrEs) by a widely distributed cellular enzyme, Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2. The EETs consequently function as transiently acting, short-range hormones; that is, they work locally to regulate the function of the cells that produce them (i.e. they are autocrine agents) or of nearby cells (i.e. they are paracrine agents). The EETs have been most studied in animal models where they show the ability to lower blood pressure possibly by a) stimulating arterial vasorelaxation and b) inhibiting the kidney's retention of salts and water to decrease intravascular blood volume. In these models, EETs prevent arterial occlusive diseases such as heart attacks and brain strokes not only by their anti-hypertension action but possibly also by their anti-inflammatory effects on blood vessels, their inhibition of platelet activation and thereby blood clotting, and/or their promotion of pro-fibrinolytic removal of blood clots. With respect to their effects on the heart, the EETs are often termed cardio-protective. Beyond these cardiovascular actions that may prevent various cardiovascular diseases, studies have implicated the EETs in the pathological growth of certain types of cancer and in the physiological and possibly pathological perception of neuropathic pain. While studies to date imply that the EETs, EET-forming epoxygenases, and EET-inactivating sEH can be manipulated to control a wide range of human diseases, clinical studies have yet to prove this. Determination of the role of the EETS in human diseases is made particularly difficult because of the large number of EET-forming epoxygenases, large number of epoxygenase substrates other than arachidonic acid, and the large number of activities, some of which may be pathological or injurious, that the EETs possess.",

The accumulation of lipid peroxides that results in the process of ferroptosis makes it peroxidation-driven, meaning it is driven by the oxidative degeneration of lipids. This process of cell death occurs when free radical molecules take electrons from a lipid molecule to cause the degradation of the lipid molecule. This degradation is the result of the lipid molecules being oxidized, meaning losing electrons, to the free radical molecules. This process makes ferroptosis a regulatory form of cell death. The reason the process of oxidative degradation of a lipid drives ferroptosis is because glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a lipid repair enzyme, undergoes a loss of activity. Researchers have identified roles in which ferroptosis can contribute to the medical field such as in aiding in cancer treatments where this form of cell death can be induced in the human body. Ferroptosis activation plays a regulatory role on growth of tumor cells in the human body. However, the positive effects of ferroptosis could be potentially neutralized by its disruption of metabolic pathways and disruption of homeostasis in the human body. Since ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death, some of the molecules that regulate ferroptosis are involved in metabolic pathways that regulate cysteine exploitation, glutathione state, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate function, lipid peroxidation and iron homeostasis.",

Coronary artery ectasia is commonly found in patients with diseases of the connective tissue and an increased inflammatory response such as Marfan syndrome and Kawasaki Disease. It can also be found transiently in patients that have undergone stent placement resulting in the stretching of the vessels 1. Coronary artery ectasia is characterized by an increased wall stress of the vessel, thinning of the arterial wall which causes progressive dilation and remodelling of the vessel. The permanent dilation of the artery is thought to be mainly caused by inflammation, triggered by disease, chemicals, or physical stress of the vessel. The inflammatory response results in an over expression of matrix metalloproteinases, cysteine proteinases, and serine proteinases that causes the partial breakdown of the vessel and weakens it. The inflammation response will also trigger platelet activation which increases the risk of blood clots. The risk of blood clots will increase due to the turbulent blood flow of the enlarged vessel which can activate platelets and form clots. Inflammation elevated oxidative stress is increased, and antioxidant activity is depressed in coronary artery ectasia. This imbalance can cause damage to the cells and cause them to die, weakening the vessels further. The activation of the inflammatory response causes a detectable increase in C reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and cell adhesion molecules, which can be used as a diagnostic marker. To discover the extent and severity of coronary artery ectasia there are a variety of diagnostic tools used. The most common method for discovering the disease is through angiography. Angiography is the procedure where a contrast dye is entered into the vessels and an x-ray is taken, which will allow the vessels to be seen on the x-ray. Using angiography clinicians are able to display the size, location and number of vessels affected by the disease. Is can also be analyzed through other methods such as intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Using these diagnostic methods, it has been discovered that the disease normally occurs most often in the right coronary artery, followed by the left anterior descending artery, and finally the left anterior circumflex artery. Using these methods Coronary artery ectasia can be divided into four different types: Type 1\u00ac\u2192diffuse ectasia in 2-3 different vessels, Type 2\u00ac\u2192 diffuse disease in 1 vessel and local disease in another, Type 3\u00ac\u2192 diffuse disease in one vessel and Type 4\u00ac\u2192 localized or segmental ectasia.",

Loss of TLR9 exacerbates progression of SLE, and leads to increased activation of dentritic cells. TLR9 also controls the release of IgA and IFN-a in SLE, and loss of the receptor leads to higher levels of both molecules. In SLE, TLR9 and TLR7 have opposing effects. TLR9 regulates inflammatory response, while TLR7 promotes inflammatory response. TLR9 has an opposite effect in ENL. TLR9 is expressed at high levels on monocytes of ENL patients, and is positively linked to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2. TLR9 agonists and antagonists may be useful in treatment of a variety of inflammatory conditions, and research in this area is active. Autoimmune thyroid diseases have also been shown to correlate with an increase in expression of TLR9 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases also have higher levels of the nuclear protein HMGB1 and RAGE protein, which together act as a ligand for TLR9. HMB1 is released from lysed or damaged cells. HMGB1-DNA complex then binds to RAGE, and activates TLR9. TLR9 can work through MyD88, an adaptor molecule that increases the expression of NF-kB. However autoimmune thyroid diseases also increase sensitivity of MyD88 independent pathways. These pathway ultimately leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PMBCs for patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases. Autoimmune diseases can also be triggered by activated cells undergoing apoptosis and being engulfed by antigen presenting cells. Activation of cells leads to de-methylation, which exposes CpG regions of host DNA, allowing an inflammatory response to be activated through TLR9. Although it is possible that TLR9 also recognizes unmethylated DNA, TLR9 undoubtedly has a role in phagocytosis-induced autoimmunity.",

When fat cells and fat tissue remain healthy during fat weight gain, patients may avoid metabolic ill health. However, if enlargement of fat cells and fat tissue causes them to become \"sick\", then important fat tissue functions are disrupted, and deranged responses contribute to metabolic disease. When excessive body weight leads to adiposopathy, this represents a hormone or endocrine disease. Additionally, fat cells and fat tissue also produce many different types of immune factors. Inflammation is a contributing cause to metabolic disease, and the ultimate contribution of fat tissue to inflammation is determined by the production of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. From a pro-inflammatory standpoint, fat tissue (which includes fat cells and other cells, such as immune cells) produces factors including: (1) adipokines with cytokine activity such as leptin, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; (2) acute phase proteins / reactants such as C-reactive protein; (3) adipokines of the alternative complement system; (4) chemotactic/chemoattractant adipokines; and prostaglandins (eicosanoids). From an anti-inflammatory standpoint, fat tissue produces various anti-inflammatory factors with the most commonly described being adiponectin. If fat cells or fat tissue becomes \"sick\", then the release of too many pro-inflammatory factors and a decrease in too many anti-inflammatory factors often result in a net pro-inflammatory response can contribute to metabolic disease.",

One common method is to use low cell adhesion plates, typically a 96 well plate, to mass-produce spheroid cultures, where the aggregates form in the rounded bottom of the cell plates. Spheroids can also be cultured using the hanging drop method, involving forming cell aggregates in drops that hang from the surface of a cell plate.

Lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF\u03b1, Interleukin 6, and IL1B) while concurrently activating anti-oxidant responses upregulated through the anti-oxidant response element (ARE) by forcing cytosolic KEAP1 to release NFE2L2 which then moves to the nucleus, binds ARE, and induces production of, e.g. hemoxygenase-1, NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase, and possibly glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier. By these actions, 15-oxo-ETE may dampen inflammatory and/or Oxidative stress responses. In a cell-free system, 15-oxo-ETE is a moderately potent (IC=1 \u03bcM) inhibitor of 12-lipoxygenase but not other human lipoxygenases. This effect could also have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects by blocking the formation of 12-HETE and Hepoxilins. 15-Oxo-ETE is an example of an \u03b1,\u03b2 unsaturated ketone Electrophile. These ketones are highly reactive with nucleophiles, adducting to, for example, the cysteines in transcription and transcription-related regulatory factors and enzymes to form their alkylated and thereby often inactivated products. It is presumed that the preceding activities of 15-oxo-ETE reflect its adduction to the indicated elements. 15-Oxo-ETE, at 2-10 \u03bcM, also inhibits the proliferation of cultured Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and LoVo human colorectal cancer cells and at the extremely high concentration of 100 \u03bcM inhibits the proliferation of cultured MBA-MD-231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells as well as SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. They may use a similar \"protein-adduction\" mechanism; if so the target protein(s) for these effects have not been defined or even suggested. This 15-oxo-ETE action may prove to inhibit the remodeling of blood vessels and reduce the growth of the cited cell types and cancers.

It seems that human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are characterized by a specific inflammatory migration program, including multiple receptors for inflammatory chemokines (CXCR3, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5). It means that the stimulation with IPP or HMB-PP induces migration to the lymphatic tissues, specifically to the T cell area of lymph nodes. So the stimulation of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells with phosphoantigens results in expression of multiple markers which are associated with APC, like MHC I and II molecules,  co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) and adhesion receptors (CD11a, CD18, CD54).

The goal of Libutti's research program is to develop novel cancer therapies through a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment. The interaction of a tumor and its vasculature is critical for both tumor growth and the spread of tumor cells to distant organs. The process of new vessel development within the tumor is termed angiogenesis and is required for tumors to grow larger than a few millimeters. In order to better understand the relationship between the tumor and its blood supply, their research is focused on the interaction between tumor-derived factors and endothelial cells developing in the context of the tumor microenvironment. By understanding this interaction they hope to be able to design novel treatment strategies to inhibit both the growth and the spread of tumors. They are currently studying a variety of tumor-derived factors with effects on tumor-associated vasculature. These include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial cell monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II). EMAP-II is a cytokine with potent effects on blood vessels and was discovered by a research team (including Libutti) at Columbia University. Cytokines such as VEGF and EMAP-II appear to be produced in varying amounts by tumors and have direct effects on the tumor neovasculature. Libutti's approach to the study of these interactions has been through the utilization of a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems. His team is using gene expression profiling to understand the changes that occur in endothelial cells exposed to tumor-derived factors. His laboratory is developing techniques, which allow them to isolate endothelial cells from tumor tissue. This has resulted in their ability to study tumor-derived endothelial cells directly, and has led to the observation that tumor associated endothelial cells have epigenetic changes compared to normal endothelial cells from the same tissue type. This approach has also allowed them to identify specific genes such as FILIP1L (formerly DOC1), which appear to play a role in the control of endothelial cell responses to angiogenesis inhibitors. They are also using noninvasive imaging techniques, including dynamic MRI and PET, to map changes in tumor blood flow within tumors both in animal models and in patients on clinical trials. A variety of inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis are being actively studied. These include both recombinant proteins derived from naturally occurring substances as well as small molecules designed to act on specific pathways. Various methods of delivering these agents, including gene therapy approaches and the use of tumor targeted nanoparticles are being pursued. Libutti was the first to administer TNF bound colloidal gold nanoparticles as targeted therapy to cancer patients. The overall goal of Libutti's work is to translate a better understanding of tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions, within the context of the tumor microenvironment, into better therapies for patients with cancer. Dr. Libutti is also studying the role of tumor suppressor genes such as \"MEN1\" in the process of tumor formation. Specifically, deciphering the role of \"MEN1\" in the tissue selective development of tumors is work for which Libutti received an R01 grant from the NCI . Libutti has published over 270 peer reviewed journal articles and currently has a Hirsch Index of 60.

Conversely, over-activation of some caspases such as caspase-3 can lead to excessive programmed cell death. This is seen in several neurodegenerative diseases where neural cells are lost, such as Alzheimer's disease. Caspases involved with processing inflammatory signals are also implicated in disease. Insufficient activation of these caspases can increase an organism's susceptibility to infection, as an appropriate immune response may not be activated.

Furthermore, the ratio of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, also known as the \"good\" cholesterol) to low-density lipoprotein (LDL, also known as the \"bad\" cholesterol) tends to be lower in smokers compared to non-smokers. Smoking also raises the levels of fibrinogen and increases platelet production (both involved in blood clotting) which makes the blood thicker and more likely to clot.

Blood cells are naturally recycled after a certain period of time, allowing for the creation of new, functional red blood cells. However, if carbon monoxide exposure reaches a certain point before they can be recycled, hypoxia (and later death) occurs. All these factors make smokers more at risk of developing various forms of arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). As the arteriosclerosis progresses, blood flows less easily through rigid and narrowed blood vessels, making the blood more likely to form a thrombosis (clot). Sudden blockage of a blood vessel may lead to an infarction (stroke or heart attack). However, it is also worth noting that the effects of smoking on the heart may be more subtle. These conditions may develop gradually given the smoking-healing cycle (the human body heals itself between periods of smoking), and therefore a smoker may develop less significant disorders such as worsening or maintenance of unpleasant dermatological conditions, e.g. eczema, due to reduced blood supply.

Growth factors such as bFGF and VEGF can induce capillary growth into the tumor, which some researchers suspect supply required nutrients, allowing for tumor expansion. Unlike normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are dilated with an irregular shape. In 2007, it was discovered that cancerous cells stop producing the anti-VEGF enzyme PKG. In normal cells (but not in cancerous ones), PKG apparently limits beta-catenin, which solicits angiogenesis. Other clinicians believe angiogenesis really serves as a waste pathway, taking away the biological end products secreted by rapidly dividing cancer cells. In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be about the size of the metal ball at the end of a ball-point pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or metastasis. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of endothelial cells and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies. The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and oxygen and a waste disposal pathway.",

Next to the skeletal and muscular system, the cardiovascular system is less strained in weightlessness than on Earth and is de-conditioned during longer periods spent in space. In a regular environment, gravity exerts a downward force, setting up a vertical hydrostatic gradient. When standing, some 'excess' fluid resides in vessels and tissues of the legs. In a micro-g environment, with the loss of a hydrostatic gradient, some fluid quickly redistributes toward the chest and upper body; sensed as 'overload' of circulating blood volume. In the micro-g environment, the newly sensed excess blood volume is adjusted by expelling excess fluid into tissues and cells (12-15% volume reduction) and red blood cells are adjusted downward to maintain a normal concentration (relative anemia). In the absence of gravity, venous blood will rush to the right atrium because the force of gravity is no longer pulling the blood down into the vessels of the legs and abdomen, resulting in increased stroke volume. These fluid shifts become more dangerous upon returning to a regular gravity environment as the body will attempt to adapt to the reintroduction of gravity. The reintroduction of gravity again will pull the fluid downward, but now there would be a deficit in both circulating fluid and red blood cells. The decrease in cardiac filling pressure and stroke volume during the orthostatic stress due to a decreased blood volume is what causes orthostatic intolerance. Orthostatic intolerance can result in temporary loss of consciousness and posture, due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume.

Coronary artery ectasia is commonly found in patients with diseases of the connective tissue and an increased inflammatory response such as Marfan syndrome and Kawasaki Disease. It can also be found transiently in patients that have undergone stent placement resulting in the stretching of the vessels 1. Coronary artery ectasia is characterized by an increased wall stress of the vessel, thinning of the arterial wall which causes progressive dilation and remodelling of the vessel. The permanent dilation of the artery is thought to be mainly caused by inflammation, triggered by disease, chemicals, or physical stress of the vessel. The inflammatory response results in an over expression of matrix metalloproteinases, cysteine proteinases, and serine proteinases that causes the partial breakdown of the vessel and weakens it. The inflammation response will also trigger platelet activation which increases the risk of blood clots. The risk of blood clots will increase due to the turbulent blood flow of the enlarged vessel which can activate platelets and form clots. Inflammation elevated oxidative stress is increased, and antioxidant activity is depressed in coronary artery ectasia. This imbalance can cause damage to the cells and cause them to die, weakening the vessels further. The activation of the inflammatory response causes a detectable increase in C reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and cell adhesion molecules, which can be used as a diagnostic marker. To discover the extent and severity of coronary artery ectasia there are a variety of diagnostic tools used. The most common method for discovering the disease is through angiography. Angiography is the procedure where a contrast dye is entered into the vessels and an x-ray is taken, which will allow the vessels to be seen on the x-ray. Using angiography clinicians are able to display the size, location and number of vessels affected by the disease. Is can also be analyzed through other methods such as intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Using these diagnostic methods, it has been discovered that the disease normally occurs most often in the right coronary artery, followed by the left anterior descending artery, and finally the left anterior circumflex artery. Using these methods Coronary artery ectasia can be divided into four different types: Type 1\u00ac\u2192diffuse ectasia in 2-3 different vessels, Type 2\u00ac\u2192 diffuse disease in 1 vessel and local disease in another, Type 3\u00ac\u2192 diffuse disease in one vessel and Type 4\u00ac\u2192 localized or segmental ectasia.",

The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is \"Blood\". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. The blood flow in arteries and veins are closely linked to the blood vessel properties. Carrying the oxygen and nutrients to various tissues and organs of our body, delivering carbon dioxide to the lungs and accepting oxygen, bringing the metabolic by products to the kidneys, regulating the body's defence mechanism, that is, the immune system and facilitating an effective heat and mass transfer across the body are some of the major functions which blood performs in the human body. Blood consists of the red blood cells or erythrocytes, white blood cells or leukocytes, and platelets or thrombocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide are known as Erythrocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in phagocytosis (the process of destruction of unknown particulate matter) and immune responses are known as Leukocytes; thrombocytes are the components of blood which are involved in blood clotting. In addition to these 55 to 60 percent of blood by volume consists of plasma. Plasma is the transparent, amber-colored liquid in which the cellular components of blood are suspended. Plasma contains constituents such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, and nutrients. The serum is blood plasma from which clotting factors have been removed.Blood accounts for 6 to 8 percent of body weight in normal, healthy humans. The density of blood is slightly greater than the density of water at approximately 1060\u00a0 kg/m3. The increased density comes from the increased density of a red blood cell compared with the density of water or plasma.  Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter. Blood Rheology is the study of blood, especially the properties associated with the deformation and flow of blood. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid. However, often the non-Newtonian effect is very small due to various reasons. Thus, it is important to know about the blood rheology. One of the characteristics of blood that affects the work required to cause the blood to flow through the arteries is the viscosity of blood. The viscosity of blood is in the range of 3 to 6 cP, or 0.003 to 0.006 Ns/m2. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid, which means that the viscosity of blood is not a constant with respect to the rate of shearing strain. In addition to the rate of shearing strain, the viscosity of blood is also dependent on temperature and on the volume percentage of blood that consists of red blood cells. If blood is made stationary for several seconds then clotting begins in the blood, as a result of which the viscosity of the blood increases. When the stationary state is disturbed with increasing shear rate, the clot formation is destroyed and the viscosity decreases. Moreover, the orientation of red blood cells present in the blood also affects the viscosity of blood. Thus, we can say that blood is a shear thinning fluid, i.e., viscosity decreases with increase in shear rate. Beyond a shear rate of about 100s^-1, the viscosity is nearly constant and the blood behaves like a Newtonian fluid. Blood is a viscoelastic material, i.e., viscous and elastic because the effective viscosity of blood not only depends on the shear rate but also on the history of shear rate.It is also important to note that the normal blood flows much more easily compared to rigid particles, for the same particle volume fraction. This is due to the fact that red blood cells can accommodate by deforming in order to pass by one another.",

Within these cells the hemoglobin molecule is broken up, and the iron gets recycled. This process also produces one molecule of carbon monoxide for every molecule of heme degraded. Heme degradation is one of the few natural sources of carbon monoxide in the human body, and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon monoxide even in people breathing pure air. The other major final product of heme degradation is bilirubin. Increased levels of this chemical are detected in the blood if red blood cells are being destroyed more rapidly than usual. Improperly degraded hemoglobin protein or hemoglobin that has been released from the blood cells too rapidly can clog small blood vessels, especially the delicate blood filtering vessels of the kidneys, causing kidney damage. Iron is removed from heme and salvaged for later use, it is stored as hemosiderin or ferritin in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as transferrins. When the porphyrin ring is broken up, the fragments are normally secreted as a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which is secreted into the intestines as bile. Intestines metabolise bilirubin into urobilinogen. Urobilinogen leaves the body in faeces, in a pigment called stercobilin.

Hemorheology, also spelled haemorheology (from the Greek \"\u2018\u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1, haima\" \"blood\" and rheology), or blood rheology, is the study of flow properties of blood and its elements of plasma and cells. Proper tissue perfusion can occur only when blood's rheological properties are within certain levels. Alterations of these properties play significant roles in disease processes. Blood viscosity is determined by plasma viscosity, hematocrit (volume fraction of red blood cell, which constitute 99.9% of the cellular elements) and mechanical properties of red blood cells. Red blood cells have unique mechanical behavior, which can be discussed under the terms erythrocyte deformability and erythrocyte aggregation. Because of that, blood behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid. As such, the viscosity of blood varies with shear rate. Blood becomes less viscous at high shear rates like those experienced with increased flow such as during exercise or in peak-systole. Therefore, blood is a shear-thinning fluid. Contrarily, blood viscosity increases when shear rate goes down with increased vessel diameters or with low flow, such as downstream from an obstruction or in diastole. Blood viscosity also increases with increases in red cell aggregability (see below).",

Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.",

            "document": "Prenatal cocaine exposure . Cocaine, a small molecule, is able to cross the placenta into the bloodstream of the fetus. In fact it may be present in a higher concentration in the amniotic fluid than it is in the mother's bloodstream. The skin of the fetus is able to absorb the chemical directly from the amniotic fluid until the 24th week of pregnancy. Cocaine can also show up in breast milk and affect the nursing baby. The severity of effects depends on how much of the drug is used, how often, and the stage in the development of the fetus. Cocaine prevents the reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Thus they stay in the synapse longer, causing excitement of the sympathetic nervous system and evoking a stress response. The euphoria experienced by cocaine users is thought to be largely due to the way it prevents the neurotransmitter serotonin from being reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron which released it. Use of cocaine during pregnancy can negatively affect both the mother and the fetus, but the ways in which it affects the fetus are poorly understood. There are three main mechanisms by which cocaine exposure harms a fetus: by altering brain chemistry, by altering the expression of certain genes, and by the constriction of blood vessels. The neurotransmitters affected by cocaine are involved in the development of the fetus's brain, so the drug may affect fetal development directly by altering the development of the brain's monoaminergic system. The most important way cocaine affects fetal development is by binding to dopamine receptors. Another possible mechanism by which cocaine harms the fetus may be in part by interfering with blood supply to the uterus. Cocaine causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in both mother and fetus, which can cause hypoxia in the fetus. Constricting blood vessels causes tissues to receive insufficient blood flow, killing cells, but this effect is less pronounced with cocaine than with nicotine. The reduction in blood flow to the uterus limits the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Cocaine also constricts the blood vessels in the fetus, which is potentially linked to slowed fetal growth and abnormal development of the genitourinary, cardiovascular, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems.",

            "document": "Organ printing . The transfer of nutrients and oxygen to cells throughout a printed organ is essential for its function. In very small or thin tissues of less than a millimeter in thickness, cells can receive nutrients through diffusion. However, larger organs require the transportation of nutrients to cells deeper inside the tissue, which requires that the tissue be vascularized, and thus able to receive blood for the exchange of cargo like oxygen and cell wastes. Early organ printing techniques created solid tissues that were unable to vascularize, or vascularized only slowly as host blood vessels entered the transplant, leading to issues like necrosis inside the tissue that can threaten the health and successful recovery of a transplant recipient. More recently developed techniques allow printed organs to be created with a more complex 3D structure, including preexisting internal vasculature, that permits faster integration of the transplant into the host circulatory system. There are multiple techniques for creating vascular systems currently under development. One method is the separate extrusion printing of vessels that are then incorporated into a larger tissue. Another method is sacrificial printing, in which the entire tissue is printed at once, and a dissolvable or otherwise removable bioink is used to form the interior of the vessels. Once this sacrificial scaffolding is removed, usually by a chemical or thermal method, the rest of tissue then contains a vascular pattern.",

In vitro and animal model studies indicate that the EETs possess anti-inflammatory activity that is directed toward reducing, resolving, and limiting the damage caused by inflammation. Most of these studies have focused on circulating leukocytes, blood vessel endothelium, and the occlusion of blood vessels due to pathological blood clotting. EETs a) inhibit vascular endothelial cells from expressing Cell adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin thereby limiting circulating leukocytes from adhering to blood vessel endothelium and migrating across this endothelium into tissues; 2) inhibit the expression and activity of cyclooxygenase-2 in blood monocytes thereby reducing their production of pro-inflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid such as prostaglandin E2; 3) inhibit platelet aggregation thereby reducing thrombus (i.e. blood clot) formation; 4) promote fibrinolysis thereby dissolving blood clots; and 5) inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation thereby reducing blood vessel hypertrophy and narrowing.",
