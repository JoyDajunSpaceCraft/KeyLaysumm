The first function is known to induce degradation of the viral receptor molecule CD4, and the second function is to enhance the release of newly formed virions from the cell surface. Vpu accomplishes these two functions through two distinct mechanisms. In the case of CD4, Vpu acts as a molecular adaptor to connect CD4 to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex resulting in CD4 degradation by cellular proteasomes. This requires signals located in Vpu\u2019s cytoplasmic domain. Enhancement of virus release on the other hand involves the neutralization of a cellular host factor, BST-2 (also known as CD317, HM1.24, or tetherin) and requires Vpu\u2019s TM domain. however, the exact mechanism of how Vpu counteracts BST-2 is still unclear. In the absence of Vpu, tetherin binds to the viral envelope and ties it to the cell membrane and other viral particles, impeding release of the viral particles. Recent data suggest that the BST-2 transmembrane domain is crucial for interference by Vpu. The interaction of Vpu and BST-2 results in the downregulation of BST-2 from the cell surface.",

HIV uses an efficient mechanism to dislocate a single-membrane-spanning host protein, CD4, from the ER and submits it to ERAD.The Vpu protein of HIV-1 is a protein on the ER membrane and targets newly-made CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum for degradation by cytosolic proteasomes. Vpu only utilizes part of the ERAD process to degrade CD4. CD4 is normally a stable protein and is not likely to be a target for ERAD. However, HIV produces the membrane protein Vpu that binds to CD4.The Vpu protein mainly retains the CD4 in the ER by SCF\u03b2-TrCP-dependent ubiquitination of the CD4 cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions. The CD4 Gly415 is a contributor to CD4-Vpu interactions, several TMD-mediated mechanisms by HIV-1 Vpu are necessary to downregulate CD4 and thus promote viral pathogenesis. CD4 retained in the ER will be a target for a variant ERAD pathway rather than predominantly appearing at the plasma membrane without the presence of Vpu through the RESET pathway. Vpu mediates the CD4 retention in the ER and the addition of degradation. As Vpu is phosphorylated, it mimics substrates for the E3 complex SCF. In cells that are infected with HIV, SCF interacts with Vpu and ubiquitinates CD4, which is subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Vpu itself escapes from the degradation.",

In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB), which are proteins that contain multiple copies of a sequence called ankyrin repeats. By virtue of their ankyrin repeat domains, the I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of NF-\u03baB proteins and keep them sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. I\u03baBs are a family of related proteins that have an N-terminal regulatory domain, followed by six or more ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain near their C terminus. Although the I\u03baB family consists of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and Bcl-3, the best-studied and major I\u03baB protein is I\u03baB\u03b1. Due to the presence of ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal halves, p105 and p100 also function as I\u03baB proteins. The c-terminal half of p100, that is often referred to as I\u03baB\u03b4, also functions as an inhibitor. I\u03baB\u03b4 degradation in response to developmental stimuli, such as those transduced through LT\u03b2R, potentiate NF-\u03baB dimer activation in a NIK dependent non-canonical pathway. Activation of the NF-\u03baB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of I\u03baB proteins. This occurs primarily via activation of a kinase called the I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits and a \"master\" regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) or IKK gamma. When activated by signals, usually coming from the outside of the cell, the I\u03baB kinase phosphorylates two serine residues located in an I\u03baB regulatory domain. When phosphorylated on these serines (e.g., serines 32 and 36 in human I\u03baB\u03b1), the I\u03baB proteins are modified by a process called ubiquitination, which then leads them to be degraded by a cell structure called the proteasome.  With the degradation of I\u03baB, the NF-\u03baB complex is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can 'turn on' the expression of specific genes that have DNA-binding sites for NF-\u03baB nearby. The activation of these genes by NF-\u03baB then leads to the given physiological response, for example, an inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, or cellular proliferation. Translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus can be detected immunocytochemically and measured by laser scanning cytometry. NF-\u03baB turns on expression of its own repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. The newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 then re-inhibits NF-\u03baB and, thus, forms an auto feedback loop, which results in oscillating levels of NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, several viruses, including the AIDS virus HIV, have binding sites for NF-\u03baB that controls the expression of viral genes, which in turn contribute to viral replication or viral pathogenicity. In the case of HIV-1, activation of NF-\u03baB may, at least in part, be involved in activation of the virus from a latent, inactive state. YopP is a factor secreted by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, that prevents the ubiquitination of I\u03baB. This causes this pathogen to effectively inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and thus block the immune response of a human infected with Yersinia.",

The first step is the interaction between envelope proteins of the virus (gp120, gp41) and specific host-cell surface receptors (e.g. CD4 receptor) on the target cell. Then the virus binds to the chemokine coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5, resulting in conformational changes in the envelope proteins.

            "document": "Orthoreovirus . Replication occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The following lists the replication cycle of the virus from attachment to egress of the new virus particle ready to infect next host cell.  Attachment occurs with the aid of the virus \u03c31 protein. This is a filamentous trimer protein that projects out of the outer capsid of the virus. There are two receptors for the virus on the host cell. There is the junctional adhesion molecule-A, which is a serotype-independent receptor as well as the sialic acid coreceptor. Viral proteins \u03bc1 and \u03c33 are responsible for attachment by binding to the receptors. After the attachment to the receptors, entry to the host cell occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis through the aid of clathrin coated pits.  Once inside the host cell, the virus must find a way to uncoat. The virus particles enter the cell in a structure known as an endosome (also called an endolysosome). Disassembly is a stepwise process. Uncoating requires a low pH, which is provided by the help of endocytic proteases. Acidification of the endosome removes the outer-capsid protein \u03c33. This removal allows membrane-penetration mediator \u03bc1 to be exposed and attachment protein \u03c31 goes through a conformational change. After uncoating is completed, the active virus is released in the cytoplasm where replication of the genome and virion takes place. Replication of the virus takes places in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Since the genome of this virus is dsRNA, early transcription of the genome must take place inside the capsid where it is safe and will not be degraded by the host cell. dsRNA inside of a cell is a tip off to the immune system that the cell is infected with a virus, since dsRNA does not occur in the normal replication of a cell. As transcription occurs with the aid of viral polymerase, protein \u03bb3 serves as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, full strands of positive sense single stranded RNA (mRNA) are synthesized from each of the dsRNA segments. Viral protein, \u03bc2, is known to be a transcriptase cofactor during transcription. It has been determined that this protein has some enzymatic functions such as NTPase activity, capping the mRNA transcript, even serving as RNA helicase to separate the dsRNA strands. The viral helicase comes from protein \u03bb3 These mRNA now are able to go into the cytoplasm to be translated into protein. The viral protein gyanyltransferase \u03bb2 is responsible for capping the viral mRNA. Mammalian orthoreovirus mRNA transcripts have a short 5\u2019 un translated region (UTR), do not have 3\u2019 poly A tails, and may even lack 5\u2019 caps during late post-infection. Thus is it not known how exactly how these uncapped versions of viral mRNA are able to use host cell ribosome to aid in translation. To be able to produce the genome, positive sense RNAs serve as the template strand to make negative sense RNA. The positive and negative strands will base-pair to create the dsRNA genome of the virus. The assembly of new virion occurs in sub-viral particles in the cytoplasm. Since this virus has two capsids, each capsid, T13 (outer capsid) and T2 (inner capsid) need to be able to self-assemble to form the virus particle. It is known that the assembly of T13 capsid is dependent on viral protein \u03c33. This allows the formation of heterohexameric complexes to be made. The T2 capsid proteins of orthoreovirus need the co-expression of both the T2 protein and the nodular \u03c32 protein to stabilize the structure and aid in assembly. Positive and negative strands of RNA produced during the transcription state must base pair correctly in order to serve as the genome in the newly formed virus particle. After virus has fully assembled and matured, the newly formed virus particle is released. It is unknown how they exit the host cell, but it thought that this is done once the host cell has died and disintegrated, allowing for easy exit of newly formed virus. Mammalian orthoreovirus does not really cause a significant disease in humans. Even though the virus is fairly common, the infection produced is either asymptomatic or causes a mild disease which is self-limiting in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory region for children and infants. Symptoms are similar to what a person might have when they have the common cold, such as a low-grade fever and pharyngitits. However, in other animals such as baboons and reptiles, other known orthoreoviruses fusogenic strains can cause more serious illness. In baboons it can cause neurological illness while in reptiles it can be the cause of pneumonia. In birds this virus may even cause death.",

Cryo-electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction of the viral capsid shows that there is a long 'spike' structure which first contacts the cell wall and likely serves to puncture the cell wall of the host. The PBCV-1 virus is specific to its host and recognition is mediated by the interaction of virus surface proteins with algal surface carbohydrates. Following attachment of the virus to the host's cell wall, capsid-bound glycolytic enzymes break down the cell wall. The viral membrane likely fuses with the host membrane, allowing the viral DNA to enter the cytoplasm, leaving an empty capsid on the outside. As PBCV-1 lacks an RNA polymerase gene, the virus must use the host cell's machinery to produce viral RNA. Thus, the viral DNA quickly moves to the nucleus where early transcription is initiated 5\u201310 minutes post infection. Within minutes of infection, host chromosomal degradation occurs, inhibiting host transcription. At 20 minutes post infection, most of the mRNAs in the infected cell are viral mRNAs. The proteins translated from the early stage of transcription are involved in initiating viral DNA replication, occurring 60\u201390 minutes post infection. The second phase of proteins are translated in the cytoplasm and the assembly of virus capsids begins about 2\u20133 hours post infection. Mature virions are formed with the addition of newly-replicated viral DNA from the host nucleus, likely facilitated by a virus encoded DNA packaging ATPase.

These infected human dendritic cells showed a slower rate of replication when deprived of the Vpr protein in HIV-1 cells. This replication difference occurred in a single round of infection. This was shown to be due to decreased transcriptional output from the integrated HIV viral genome. Using mutational analysis (biochemical identification of mutational changes in a nucleotide sequence), prevention of cell cycle progression into mitosis was shown to be required for LTR-mediated viral expression. These findings suggest that the evolutionarily secured G2 cell cycle arrest function of Vpr (Viral Protein R) is essential for HIV-1 replication.

The APC/C is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase, which triggers the metaphase to anaphase transition by marking select proteins for degradation. The two main targets of the APC/C are the S/M cyclins and the protein securin. S/M cyclins activate cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which have a vast array of downstream effects that work to guide the cell through mitosis. They must be degraded for cells to exit mitosis. Securin is a protein that inhibits separase, which in turn inhibits cohesin, a protein that holds sister chromatids together. Therefore, in order for anaphase to progress, securin must be inhibited so that cohesin can be cleaved by separase. These processes are dependent on both the APC/C and Cdc20: When Cdks phosphorylate the APC/C, Cdc20 can bind and activate it, allowing both the degradation of Cdks and the cleavage of cohesin. APC/C activity is dependent on Cdc20 (and Cdh1), because Cdc20 often binds the APC/C substrates directly. In fact, it is thought that Cdc20 and Cdh1 (see below) are receptors for the KEN-box and D-box motifs on substrates.

They vary in their shape depending upon the species but are generally shaped like a brick or as an oval form similar to a rounded brick because they are wrapped by the endoplasmic reticulum. The virion is exceptionally large, its size is around 200 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length and carries its genome in a single, linear, double-stranded segment of DNA. By comparison, Rhinovirus is 1/10 as large as a typical \"Poxviridae\" virion. Replication of the poxvirus involves several stages. The virus first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface; the receptors for the poxvirus are thought to be glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). After binding to the receptor, the virus enters the cell where it uncoats. Uncoating of the virus is a two step process. Firstly the outer membrane is removed as the particle enters the cell; secondly the virus particle (without the outer membrane) fuses with the cellular membrane to release the core into the cytoplasm. The pox viral genes are expressed in two phases. The early genes encode the non-structural protein, including proteins necessary for replication of the viral genome, and are expressed before the genome is replicated. The late genes are expressed after the genome has been replicated and encode the structural proteins to make the virus particle. The assembly of the virus particle occurs in five stages of maturation that lead to the final exocytosis of the new enveloped virion. After the genome has been replicated, the immature virion (IV) assembles the A5 protein to create the intracellular mature virion (IMV). The protein aligns and the brick-shaped envelope of the intracellular enveloped virion (IEV). These IEV particles are then fused to the cell plasma to form the cell-associated enveloped virion (CEV). Finally, the CEV encounters the microtubules and the virion prepares to exit the cell as an extracellular enveloped virion (EEV). The assembly of the virus particle occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is a complex process that is currently being researched to understand each stage in more depth. Considering the fact that this virus is large and complex, replication is relatively quick taking approximately 12 hours until the host cell dies by the release of viruses.",

This assembly/maturation event stabilizes virions, and increases their specific infectivity.

Bieniasz started his own independent lab in 1999 at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and Rockefeller University in New York. Initially he worked on understanding how later steps of viral infection, such as assembly and budding, were inhibited in rodent cells . This interest in viral budding came to define Bieniasz's career. Bieniasz showed that the retroviral protein Gag assembles at the plasma membrane, recruiting the viral genome by hijacking a specialized cellular protein complex involved in membrane vesicle trafficking, the ESCRT complex. Together with his wife and colleague, Theodora Hatziioannou, they identified several host-specific factors that restrict replication of HIV-1 in macaques. Tetherin, a potent antiviral factor, was also discovered in his lab and shown to be counteracted by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu. Subsequently, another inhibitor of HIV-1 replication was discovered in his lab, Mx2, a cellular protein shown to inhibit post-entry steps of the HIV-1 infection. In recent years, Paul Bieniasz's group has focused on viral RNA interactions with cellular proteins; in particular, his group showed that APOBEC3G is recruited to virions by interaction with the viral RNA, and that CG-depletion of HIV-1 genomes is a mechanism to evade the antiviral, RNA-binding protein ZAP.

It has been proposed that the viroplasm could be the product of a co-evolution between the virus and its host. It is possible that a cellular response originally designed to reduce the toxicity of misfolded proteins is exploited by cytoplasmic viruses to improve their replication, the virus capsid synthesis, and assembly. Alternatively, the activation of host defense mechanisms may involve sequestration of virus components in aggregates to prevent their dissemination, followed by their neutralisation.

Vpu only utilizes part of the ERAD process to degrade CD4. CD4 is normally a stable protein and is not likely to be a target for ERAD.

The result is a \"polyubiquitin chain\" that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.",

A ubiquitin ligase (also called an E3 ubiquitin ligase) is a protein that recruits an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that has been loaded with ubiquitin, recognizes a protein substrate, and assists or directly catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the protein substrate. The ubiquitin is attached to a lysine on the target protein by an isopeptide bond. E3 ligases interact with both the target protein and the E2 enzyme, and so impart substrate specificity to the E2. Commonly, E3s polyubiquitinate their substrate with Lys48-linked chains of ubiquitin, targeting the substrate for destruction by the proteasome. However, many other types of linkages are possible and alter a protein's activity, interactions, or localization. Ubiquitination by E3 ligases regulates diverse areas such as cell trafficking, DNA repair, and signaling and is of profound importance in cell biology. E3 ligases are also key players in cell cycle control, mediating the degradation of cyclins, as well as cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor proteins.

The concerted mechanism of HRD1, a member of E3-ubiquitin ligase family, and p97/VCP1 was found to play an important role in the degradation of NFE2L1 through the ER Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathway and the release of NFE2L1 from the ER membrane. NFE2L1 is also regulated by other ubiquitin ligases and kinases. FBXW7, a member of the SCF ubiquitin ligase family, targets NFE2L1 for proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. FBXW7 requires the Cdc4 phosphodegron domain within NFE2L1 to be phosphorylated via Glycogen Kinase 3. Casein Kinase 2 was shown to phosphorylate Ser497 of NFE2L1, which attenuates the activity of NFE2L1 on proteasome gene expression. NFE2L1 also interacts with another member of the SCF ligase ubiquitin family known as \u03b2-TrCP. \u03b2-TrCP also binds to the DSGLC motif, a highly conserved region of CNC-bZIP proteins, in order to poly-ubiquitinate NFE2L1 prior to its proteolytic degradation.
