As pattern recognition receptors, RLRs live in the cytosol of a cell, so that they can detect the presence of viral DNA or RNA. Upon detection of a viral infection, two of the RLRs, RIG-I and MDA5, possess the ability to activate a complex signaling network that leads to the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize distinct viruses but both produce the antiviral immune changes that initiate an innate response and regulate the subsequent adaptive response. LGP2, the remaining RLR, lacks the ability to induce signaling alone, but is necessary for effective RIG-I and MDA5-mediated antiviral responses.",

It turned out that this sensing pathway is related to RNA interference (siRNA, microRNA). In RNA interference, the helicase DICER cleaves longer double-stranded RNA molecules into shorter siRNA or microRNA which are then integrated into the RISC complex. The antisense strand within this RISC complex is responsible for the sequence specificity of silencing of the corresponding target mRNA. In more primitive organisms such as worms RNA interference is used to destroy foreign nucleic acids. This defense mechanism can be regarded as a specific form of a nucleic acid-based immune system in which the newly generated siRNAs function as immune effector molecules. In higher organisms such as vertebrates, this DICER-based defense system is replaced by another defense mechanism. Two helicases related to DICER, RIG-I and MDA5, take over the challenge to detect foreign RNA in the cytosol of cells. However, unlike the helicase DICER, upon recognition of foreign RNA RIG-I and MDA5 trigger a broad spectrum of antiviral activities in the cell including type I IFN. Hartmann and colleagues identified the specific RNA ligand structure detected by RIG-I: RNA with a blunt end and a 5\u00b4-triphosphate. In a subsequent publication, his group elucidated how the molecular structure of the binding pocket of RIG-I precludes binding of N1-2\u2032O methylated RNA, thus preventing recognition of endogenous mRNA by the innate immune system.",

Identification of the receptor hinged on the positional cloning of the mammalian \"Lps\" locus, which had been known since the 1960s as a key genetic determinant of all biological responses to LPS. Beutler thus discovered the key sensors of microbial infection in mammals, demonstrating that one of the mammalian Toll-like receptors, TLR4, acts as the membrane-spanning component of the mammalian LPS receptor complex. The TLRs (of which ten are now known to exist in humans) are now widely known to function in the perception of microbes, each detecting signature molecules that herald infection. These receptors also mediate severe illness, including shock and systemic inflammation as it occurs in the course of an infection. They are central to the pathogenesis of sterile inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The research on TLRs won him the Nobel Prize in 2011.The positional cloning of \"Lps\" was completed in 1998. Beutler thereafter continued to apply a forward genetic approach to the analysis of immunity in mammals. In this process, germline mutations that alter immune function are created through a random process using the alkylating agent ENU, detected by their phenotypic effects, and then isolated by positional cloning.

            "document": "Human T-lymphotropic virus . HTLV-1 is an abbreviation for \"human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1\", also called human T-cell leukemia type 1, a virus that has been implicated in several kinds of diseases, including HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, and as a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).HTLV-1 has six reported subtypes (subtypes A to F). The great majority of infections are caused by the cosmopolitan subtype A. HTLV was discovered by Robert Gallo and colleagues in 1980. Between 1 in 20 and 1 in 25 infected people are thought to develop cancer as a result of the virus. HTLV-1 infection is thought to spread only through dividing cells since reverse transcriptase generates proviral DNA from genomic viral RNA, and the provirus is integrated into the host genome by viral integrase after transmission. Therefore, the quantification of provirus reflects the number of HTLV-1-infected cells. So, an increase in numbers of HTLV-1-infected cells using cell division, by actions of accessory viral genes, especially Tax, may provide an enhancement of infectivity Tax expression induces proliferation, inhibits the apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected cells and, conversely, evokes the host immune response, including cytotoxic T cells, to kill virus-infected cells. Interesting, HTLV-1 Tax viral gene is known to dampen innate antiviral signaling pathways to avoid host detection and elimination, through SOCS1 and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Interacting Protein (AIP).",

It enters using the cell\u2019s own receptors, which were not originally designed for viral entry.

CD150 can be found on many immune cells including: macrophages, dendritic cells, B-cells and T-cells. PVRL4 is present in keratinocytes of the epidermis and bronchial epithelial cells. Additionally, the viral V protein is known to have a role in inhibiting MDA-5 antiviral signaling, which acts to increase interferon production in the face of infection. Once virally infected, MDA-5 sends out signals corresponding with an antiviral state in order that fewer interferons be produced to interfere with viral replication. While the virus uses its own enzyme to make a copy of its genome, it hijacks host ribosomes to translate its RNA into protein. Specifically in felines, the virus is known to interact with the renal system, but in other species it has been known to negatively influence the respiratory, epithelial, immune and central nervous systems.",

The innate immune system has evolved to protect against infection by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and triggering a complex set of responses collectively known as \u201cinflammation\u201d. Many cells express specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for exogenous RNA including toll-like receptor 3,7,8 (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8), the RNA helicase RIG1 (RARRES3), protein kinase R (PKR, a.k.a. EIF2AK2), members of the oligoadenylate synthetase family of proteins (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3), and others. All of these proteins can specifically bind to exogenous RNA molecules and trigger an immune response. The specific chemical, structural or other characteristics of long RNA molecules that are required for recognition by PRRs remain largely unknown despite intense study. At any given time, a typical mammalian cell may contain several hundred thousand mRNA and other, regulatory long RNA molecules. How cells distinguish exogenous long RNA from the large amount of endogenous long RNA is an important open question in cell biology. Several reports suggest that phosphorylation of the 5\u2019-end of a long RNA molecule can influence its immunogenicity, and specifically that 5\u2019-triphosphate RNA, which can be produced during viral infection, is more immunogenic than 5\u2019-diphosphate RNA, 5\u2019-monophosphate RNA or RNA containing no 5\u2019 phosphate. However, in vitro-transcribed (ivT) long RNA containing a 7-methylguanosine cap (present in eukaryotic mRNA) is also highly immunogenic despite having no 5\u2019 phosphate, suggesting that characteristics other than 5\u2019-phosphorylation can influence the immunogenicity of an RNA molecule.",

The L segment is 9010 nt and encodes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The M segment is 4955 nt and to encode for NSm and G/G proteins. The S segment is 2603 nt and encodes the N and NSs proteins. This virus codes proteins from the M and S segments in an ambisense manner, meaning that proteins are translated from both positive and negative sense RNA. There is preliminary evidence to suggest low diversity within SVNV. These proteins occur in all members of the Tospovirus genus, and likely serve similar functions within SVNV as they do for the type member of the Tospovirus genus (TSWV). The RdRp aids in replication and transcription of the RNA. The NSm protein is a non-structural protein (not present in mature virion) and is critical to cell-to-cell movement within plant cells (8). The NSs protein is also a non-structural protein and contributes to suppression of RNA silencing during plant infection. Glycoproteins (G/G) are necessary for successful thrips transmission. The N protein contributes to viral replication, and coats the genomic RNA within the virion.",

            "document": "Gunther Hartmann . The next scientific focus was on immune sensing of RNA in the cytosol of cells. It turned out that this sensing pathway is related to RNA interference (siRNA, microRNA). In RNA interference, the helicase DICER cleaves longer double-stranded RNA molecules into shorter siRNA or microRNA which are then integrated into the RISC complex. The antisense strand within this RISC complex is responsible for the sequence specificity of silencing of the corresponding target mRNA. In more primitive organisms such as worms RNA interference is used to destroy foreign nucleic acids. This defense mechanism can be regarded as a specific form of a nucleic acid-based immune system in which the newly generated siRNAs function as immune effector molecules. In higher organisms such as vertebrates, this DICER-based defense system is replaced by another defense mechanism. Two helicases related to DICER, RIG-I and MDA5, take over the challenge to detect foreign RNA in the cytosol of cells. However, unlike the helicase DICER, upon recognition of foreign RNA RIG-I and MDA5 trigger a broad spectrum of antiviral activities in the cell including type I IFN. Hartmann and colleagues identified the specific RNA ligand structure detected by RIG-I: RNA with a blunt end and a 5\u00b4-triphosphate. In a subsequent publication, his group elucidated how the molecular structure of the binding pocket of RIG-I precludes binding of N1-2\u2032O methylated RNA, thus preventing recognition of endogenous mRNA by the innate immune system.",

            "document": "Batai virus . It is well known that the geographical distribution of Batai virus (BATV) includes the regions of Europe, Asia and Africa. The most common vertebrate affected by BATV are domestic pigs, horses, ruminants and wild birds, which have been known to be the primary mammalian hosts. The transmission cycle of BATV occurs in agricultural ecosystems via Anopheles, Culex and Ochlerotatus species mosquitoes in a typical vertebrate\u2013mosquito cycle.  While limited research has been conducted on the viral cycle of the Batai virus, comparable studies with the close relative Bunyamwera virus has shown that viral infection begins in the salivary glands of mosquitos. At the onset of replication the virus particles coalesce into vacuole membranes lining the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Entry into the cell is facilitated by the viral enveloped nucleocapsid, which contains glycoproteins G1 and G2. Encoded by the M RNA segment they are involved in attachment to the host cell through unidentified receptors on the surface and elicit neutralizing antibodies. Transcription of BATV is said to be similar to that of influenza in that mRNA synthesis is primed by cap-containing oligonucleotides that are generated by a certain viral-endonuclease, functioning to cleave the host cell mRNA. These resulting primers are then incorporated into the viral mRNA. BATV will also encode for two non-structural proteins, NSm on the M segment and NSs on the S segment. During the process it is believed that NSm actively participates in assembly of the virus. These newly assembled viral particles will mature over a period of time inside of the hosts cell in the membranes of the Golgi apparatus before being released. However, while able to replicate in both vertebrate and invertebrate species, in mosquito cells no cell death is observed and persistent infection is established. Whereas in mammalian cells infection is typically categorized as lytic and eventually leads to cell death. This stems from the viruses ability to form clear lytic plaques in cells of vertebrate species but not in those derived from insects. It has been demonstrated in previous studies that in mammalian cells, the NSs protein will induce a shut-off of host protein synthesis which will lead to the death of the host cell. It has also been shown to counteract the host cell antiviral response. This would establish it as the main virulence factor as it acts during the transcriptional phase by inhibiting RNA polymerase II\u2013mediated transcription. Meanwhile, the mosquito cells neither host cell transcription nor translation are inhibited by this fact. It would seem the difference in the behavior of the NSs protein could be one of the factors responsible for the different outcomes of infection attributed to the Batai virus in mammalian and mosquito cells. Some have theorized that a release method that does not rupture the cell membrane could explain why viral replication does not kill mosquito cells and persistence is maintained. Similar NSs proteins of the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus have quite a distinct size and amino acid sequence, but they play a similar role in mammalian cells in overcoming the innate immune responses that are a consequence of the global shut-down of the cells transcription mechanisms.

In 2012 it was reported how Lassa virus nucleoprotein (NP) sabotages the host's innate immune system response. Generally, when a pathogen enters into a host, innate defense system recognizes the Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and activates an immune response. One of the mechanisms detects double stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is only synthesized by negative-sense viruses. In the cytoplasm, dsRNA receptors, such as RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation associated gene 5), detect dsRNAs and initiate signaling pathways that translocate IRF-3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) and other transcription factors to the nucleus. Translocated transcription factors activate expression of interferons \ud835\udec2 and \ud835\udec3, and these initiate adaptive immunity. NP encoded in Lassa virus is essential in viral replication and transcription, but it also suppresses host innate IFN response by inhibiting translocation of IRF-3. NP of Lassa virus is reported to have an exonuclease activity to only dsRNAs. the NP dsRNA exonuclease activity counteracts IFN responses by digesting the PAMPs thus allowing the virus to evade host immune responses.",
