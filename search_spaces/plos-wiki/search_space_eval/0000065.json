In a targeted approach, sequencing of ctDNA can be directed towards a genetic panel constructed based on mutational hotspots for the cancer of interest. This is especially important for informing treatment in situations where mutations are identified in druggable targets. Personalizing targeted analysis of ctDNA to each patient is also possible by combining liquid biopsies with standard primary tissue biopsies. Whole genome or whole exome sequencing of the primary tumor biopsy allows for discovery of genetic mutations specific to a patient\u2019s tumor, and can be used for subsequent targeted sequencing of the patient\u2019s ctDNA. The highest sensitivity of ctDNA detection is accomplished through targeted sequencing of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Commonly mutated genes, such as oncogenes, which typically have hotspot mutations, are good candidates for targeted sequencing approaches. Conversely, most tumor suppressor genes have a wide array of possible loss of function mutations throughout the gene, and as such are not suitable for targeted sequencing.",

            "document": "ROS1 . Gene rearrangements involving the \"ROS1\" gene were first detected in glioblastoma tumors and cell lines. In 2007 a \"ROS1\" rearrangement was identified in a cell line derived from a lung adenocarcinoma patient. Since that discovery, multiple studies have demonstrated an incidence of approximately 1% in lung cancers, demonstrated oncogenicity, and showed that inhibition of tumor cells bearing \"ROS1\" gene fusions by crizotinib or other \"ROS1\" tyrosine kinase inhibitors was effective in vitro. Clinical data supports the use of crizotinib in lung cancer patients with \"ROS1\" gene fusions. Preclinical and clinical work suggests multiple potential mechanisms of drug resistance in \"ROS1\" + lung cancer, including kinase domain mutations in \"ROS1\" and bypass signaling via RAS and EGFR. Although the most preclinical and clinical studies of \"ROS1\" gene fusions have been performed in lung cancer, \"ROS1\" fusions have been detected in multiple other tumor histologies, including ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, cholangiocarcinomas and others. Crizotinib or other \"ROS1\" inhibitors may be effective in other tumor histologies beyond lung cancer as demonstrated by a patient with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor harboring a \"ROS1\" fusion with a dramatic response to crizotinib.",
