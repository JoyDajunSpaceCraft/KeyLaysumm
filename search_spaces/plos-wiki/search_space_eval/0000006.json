The role of Fascin in regulating cytoskeletal structures for the maintenance of cell adhesion, coordinating motility and invasion through interactions with signalling pathways is an active area of research especially from the cancer biology perspective. Fascin localizes to actin-rich protrusions at the cell surface called filopodia. Recent study shows that fascin also localizes to invadopodia, membrane protrusions formed at the adherent cell surface that facilitate extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion, this provide a potential molecular mechanism for how fascin increases the invasiveness of cancer cells since fascin expression is upregulated in a spectrum of cancers. Studies have also shown that Fascin plays a major role in immune suppression. T regulatory cell adhesion to antigen presenting dendritic cell causes sequestration of Fascin-1, an actin-bundling protein essential for immunological synapse formation, and skews Fascin-1\u2013dependent actin polarization in antigen presenting dendritic cells toward the T reg cell adhesion zone. Although it is reversible upon T regulatory cell disengagement, this sequestration of essential cytoskeletal components causes a lethargic state of dendritic cells, leading to reduced T cell priming. This suggests Treg-mediated suppression of antigen presenting cells is a multi-step process. In addition to CTLA-4 CD80/CD86 interaction fascin dependent polarization of cytoskeleton towards dendritic cell Treg immune synapse play a pivotal role. In normal tissue, inflammation and the immune response would be limited by secretion of TGF-\u03b2. TGF-\u03b2 on the one hand induces fascin expression, but on the other hand, restricts activity of transcription factor NF-\u03baB.

This means that the use of regulatory T cells in therapy may be risky, as the T regulatory cell transferred to the patient may change into T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are pro-inflammatory rather than regulatory cells. Th17 cells are proinflammatory and are produced under similar environments as a/iTregs. Th17 cells are produced under the influence of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 (or IL-21), whereas a/iTregs are produced under the influence of solely TGF-\u03b2, so the difference between a proinflammatory and a pro-regulatory scenario is the presence of a single interleukin. IL-6 or IL-21 is being debated by immunology laboratories as the definitive signaling molecule. Murine studies point to IL-6 whereas human studies have shown IL-21.

During T cell-activation, calcium enters lymphocytes through store-operated CRAC channels (calcium release activated channel) formed as a complex of Orai and Stim proteins. The rise in intracellular calcium initiates a signaling cascade culminating in cytokine production and proliferation. The K1.3 K channel and the calcium-activated K3.1 K channel in T cells promote calcium entry into the cytoplasm through CRAC by providing a counterbalancing cation efflux. Blockade of K1.3 depolarizes the membrane potential of T cells, suppresses calcium signaling and IL-2 production, but not IL2-receptor expression. K1.3 blockers have no effect on activation pathways that are independent of a rise in intracellular calcium (e.g. anti-CD28, IL-2). Expression of the K1.3 and K3.1 channels varies during T cell activation and differentiation into memory T cells. When na\u00efve T cells and central memory T cells (T) are activated they upregulate K3.1 expression to ~500 per cell without significant change in K1.3 numbers. In contrast, when terminally differentiated effector memory subsets (T, T [T effector memory re-expressing CD45RA]) are activated, they upregulate K1.3 to 1500 per cell without changes in K3.1. The K1.3 channel number increases and the K3.1 channel number decreases as T cells are chronically activated. As a result of this differential expression, blockers of K3.1 channels preferentially suppress the function of na\u00efve and T cells, while ShK and its analogues that selectively inhibit K1.3 channels preferentially suppress the function of chronically-activated effector memory T cells (T, T).",

Helminths secrete immunoregulatory molecules that promote the induction of regulatory T cells while inhibiting the function of antigen presenting cells and other T cells. As such, helminthic therapy attempts to restore homeostasis by shifting a hyperactive Th1 pro-inflammatory response to a Th2 response with reduced inflammation. Human and animal studies have provided evidence of decreased Th1 and Th17 immune responses with a shift to Th2 cytokine production resulting in significantly decreased levels of interleukin 12 and IFNy with simultaneous increases in the regulatory T cells, interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10 of test subjects. These observations indicate that helminth therapy can provide protection against autoimmune disease not only through prevention, since helminths can be present before autoimmune disease develops, but also after autoimmune responses are initiated.

Delineating how CD4 T cells are depleted and how chronic inflammation and immune activation are induced lies at the heart of understanding HIV pathogenesis\u2013\u2013one of the top priorities for HIV research by the Office of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health. Recent studies demonstrated that caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, drives CD4 T-cell depletion and inflammation by HIV. These are the two signature events that propel HIV disease progression to AIDS. Pyroptosis appears to create a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells and other immune cells (including macrophages and neutrophils) release inflammatory signals that recruit more cells into the infected lymphoid tissues to die. The feed-forward nature of this inflammatory response produces chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Identifying pyroptosis as the predominant mechanism that causes CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation, provides novel therapeutic opportunities, namely caspase-1 which controls the pyroptotic pathway. In this regard, pyroptosis of CD4 T cells and secretion of pro-inflmammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 can be blocked in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, which has already proven to be safe and well tolerated in phase II human clinical trials.

Other regulatory immune cells include T cell subsets similar to but phenotypically distinct from Treg cells, including TR1 cells that make IL-10 but do not express Foxp3, TGF-\u03b2-secreting TH3 cells, as well as other less well-characterized cells that help establish a local tolerogenic environment. B cells also express CD22, a non-specific inhibitor receptor that dampens B cell receptor activation. A subset of B regulatory cells that makes IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 also exists. Some DCs can make Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that depletes the amino acid tryptophan needed by T cells to proliferate and thus reduce responsiveness. DCs also have the capacity to directly induce anergy in T cells that recognize antigen expressed at high levels and thus presented at steady-state by DCs. In addition, FasL expression by immune privileged tissues can result in activation-induced cell death of T cells.",

Butyrate also suppresses colonic inflammation by inhibiting the IFN-\u03b3\u2013STAT1 signaling pathways, which is mediated partially through histone deacetylase inhibition. While transient IFN-\u03b3 signaling is generally associated with normal host immune response, chronic IFN-\u03b3 signaling is often associated with chronic inflammation. It has been shown that butyrate inhibits activity of HDAC1 that is bound to the Fas gene promoter in T cells, resulting in hyperacetylation of the Fas promoter and up-regulation of Fas receptor on the T-cell surface. It is thus suggested that butyrate enhances apoptosis of T cells in the colonic tissue and thereby eliminates the source of inflammation (IFN-\u03b3 production).",

Studies indicate that the mechanism by which a drug or its metabolites accomplishes this stimulation involves subverting the antigen presentation pathways of the innate immune system. A drug or metabolite covalently binds with a host protein to form a non-self, drug-related epitope. An antigen presenting cell (APC) takes up these proteins; digests them into small peptides; places the peptides in a groove on the human leukocyte antigen (i.e. HLA) component of their major histocompatibility complex (i.e. MHC) (APC); and presents the MHC-associated peptides to the T-cell receptor on CD8 T or CD4 T cells. Those peptides expressing a drug-related, non-self epitope on their HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DM, HLA-DO, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, or HLA-DR proteins may bind to a T-cell receptor to stimulate the receptor-bearing parent T cell to attack self tissues. Alternatively, a drug or metabolite may also stimulate T cells by inserting into the groove on a HLA protein to serve as a non-self epitope, bind outside of this groove to alter a HLA protein so that it forms a non-self epitope, or bypass the APC by binding directly to a T cell receptor. However, non-self epitopes must bind to specific HLA serotypes to stimulate T cells and the human population expresses some 13,000 different HLA serotypes while an individual expresses only a fraction of them. Since a SCARs-inducing drug or metabolite interacts with only one or a few HLA serotypes, their ability to induce SCARs is limited to those individuals who express HLA serotypes targeted by the drug or metabolite. Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop SCARs in response to a particular drug on the bases of their expression of HLA serotypes. Studies have identified several HLA serotypes associated with development of DRESS syndrome, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN in response to various drugs which elici these disorders, developed tests to identify individuals who express these serotypes, and thereby determined that these individuals should avoid the offending drug. HLA serotypes associated with AGEP and specific drugs have not been identified.

An antigen presenting cell (APC) takes up these alter proteins; digests them into small peptides; places the peptides in a groove on the human leukocyte antigen (i.e. HLA) component of their major histocompatibility complex (i.e. MHC); and presents the MHC-associated peptides to the T-cell receptor on CD8 T or CD4 T cells. Those peptides expressing a drug-related, non-self epitope on their HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DM, HLA-DO, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, or HLA-DR proteins may bind to a T-cell receptor to stimulate the receptor-bearing parent T cell to initiate attacks on self tissues. Alternatively, a drug or metabolite may stimulate these T cells by inserting into the groove on a HLA protein to serve as a non-self epitope or bind outside of this groove to alter a HLA protein so that it forms a non-self epitope. Importantly, however, non-self epitopes must bind to specific HLA serotypes in order to stimulate T cells. Since the human population expresses some 13,000 different HLA serotypes while an individual expresses only a fraction of them and since a DRESSs-inducing drug or metabolite interacts with only one or a few HLA serotypes, a drug's ability to induce SCARs is limited to those individuals who express HLA serotypes targeted by the drug or its metabolite. Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop SCARs in response to a particular drug on the bases of their expression of HLA serotypes. Studies have identified several HLA serotypes associated with development of the DRESS syndrome in response to certain drugs, have developed tests to identify individuals who express some of these serotypes, and thereby have identified individuals who should avoid certain DRESS syndrome-inducing drugs.",

Delineating how CD4 T cells are depleted and how chronic inflammation and immune activation are induced lies at the heart of understanding HIV pathogenesis\u2013\u2013one of the top priorities for HIV research by the Office of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health. Recent studies demonstrated that caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, drives CD4 T-cell depletion and inflammation by HIV. These are the two signature events that propel HIV disease progression to AIDS. Pyroptosis appears to create a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells and other immune cells (including macrophages and neutrophils) release inflammatory signals that recruit more cells into the infected lymphoid tissues to die. The feed-forward nature of this inflammatory response produces chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Identifying pyroptosis as the predominant mechanism that causes CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation, provides novel therapeutic opportunities, namely caspase-1 which controls the pyroptotic pathway. In this regard, pyroptosis of CD4 T cells and secretion of pro-inflmammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 can be blocked in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, which has already proven to be safe and well tolerated in phase II human clinical trials. These findings could propel development of an entirely new class of \u201canti-AIDS\u201d therapies that act by targeting the host rather than the virus. Such agents would almost certainly be used in combination with ART. By promoting \u201ctolerance\u201d of the virus instead of suppressing its replication, VX-765 or related drugs may mimic the evolutionary solutions occurring in multiple monkey hosts (e.g. the sooty mangabey) infected with species-specific lentiviruses that have led to a lack of disease, no decline in CD4 T-cell counts, and no chronic inflammation.",

Studies of human subjects with a history of leishmania infection suggest that modulation of CD8 suppressor T cells is, at least partly, mediated by cytokines. Leishmania specific CD4 helper T cells predominate in adults with strong protective immunity (skin-test positive with no history of clinical infection). When added to autologous leishmania infected macrophages these T cells cause parasite death and secretion of large amounts of interferon-gamma and lymphotoxin. CD8 T suppressor cells predominate in patients with no protective immunity (visceral leishmaniasis patients). When added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated after successful treatment, these T cells inhibit interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation and increase interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 secretion. A soluble factor(s) generated by antigen or phytohemagglutinin stimulation of leishmania-specific CD4 helper T cells from skin-test positive adults killed CD8 T cells but not CD4 helper T cells when added to culture media. Soluble factors generated by antigen stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from skin-test positive adults prevented CD8 suppressor T cell mediated increases in interleukin-10 secretion. These findings suggest that antigen stimulation of CD4 helper T cells results in production of cytokines that kill or down regulate CD8 T suppressor cells. Once the leishmania infection has been eliminated and leishmania antigens are gone, CD8 T suppressor cells down-regulate CD4 T helper cells. Isolation of cytokines that inhibit and kill CD8 T suppressor cells might be useful in treating diseases that involve immune suppression such as leishmaniasis, AIDS, and certain cancers.",

Other receptors are expressed upon activation of the T cell, such as OX40 and ICOS, but these largely depend upon CD28 for their expression. The second signal licenses the T cell to respond to an antigen. Without it, the T cell becomes anergic, and it becomes more difficult for it to activate in future. This mechanism prevents inappropriate responses to self, as self-peptides will not usually be presented with suitable co-stimulation.
