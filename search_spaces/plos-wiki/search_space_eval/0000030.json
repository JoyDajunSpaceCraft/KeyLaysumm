Insulin then causes the activation of PI3K, which subsequently phosphorylates Akt. Akt then phosphorylates FOXO1, causing nuclear exclusion. This phosphorylated FOXO1 is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome. The phosphorylation of FOXO1 is irreversible; this prolongs insulin's inhibitory effect on glucose metabolism and hepatic glucose production. Transcription of glucose 6-phosphatase subsequently decreases, which consequently decreases the rates of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. FOXO1 also activates transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is required for gluconeogenesis. The activity of FOXO1 is also regulated through CBP induced acetylation on Lys-242, Lys-245, and Lys-262. These lysine residues are located within the DNA-binding domain; acetylation inhibits the ability of FOXO1 to interact with the glucose-6 phosphatase promoter by decreasing the stability of the FOXO1-DNA complex. Additionally, this acetylation increases the rate of phosphorylation on Ser-253 by Akt. Mutating Ser-253 to Ala-253 makes FOXO1 constitutionally active. SIRT1 reverses this acetylation process; however, the exact mechanism by which SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO1 is still under investigation; presently, acetylation is thought to mitigate the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 and thereby provide an additional level of metabolic regulation that is independent of the insulin/PI3K pathway.

Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them.

During embryonic development, the absence of NGF activates apoptosis by decreasing the activity of the signaling pathways normally activated by NGF. this pathway of apoptosis has also been named the intrinsic pathway, as it is activated by intrinsic factors over external factors. Without NGF, the neurons of the sympathetic nervous system begin to atrophy, glucose uptake rates fall and the rates of protein synthesis and gene expression slow. Apoptotic death from NGF withdrawal also requires caspase activity. Upon NGF withdrawal, caspase-3 activation occurs through an in-vitro pathway beginning with the release of Cytochrome c from the mitochondria. In a surviving sympathetic neuron, the overexpression of anti-apoptotic B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins prevents NGF withdrawal-induced death. However, overexpression of a separate, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene, Bax, stimulates the release of Cytochrome c2. Cytochrome c promotes the activation of caspase-9 through the formation of the apoptosome. Once caspase-9 is activated, it can cleave and activate caspase-3 resulting in cell death. Notably, apoptosis does not release intracellular fluid as neurons that are degraded through ferroptosis do. During ferroptosis, neurons release lipid metabolites from inside the cell body. This is a key difference between ferroptosis and apoptosis.",

One such signaling event is the introduction of granzyme B, which can activate initiator caspases, into cells targeted for apoptosis by killer T cells. This extrinsic activation then triggers the hallmark caspase cascade characteristic of the apoptotic pathway, in which caspase-3 plays a dominant role. In intrinsic activation, cytochrome c from the mitochondria works in combination with caspase-9, apoptosis-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), and ATP to process procaspase-3.

It is an energy dependent process mediated by proteolytic enzymes called caspases, which trigger cell death through the cleaving of specific proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The dying cells shrink and condense into apoptotic bodies. The cell surface is altered so as to display properties which lead to rapid phagocytosis by macrophages or neighbouring cells. Unlike necrotic cell death, neighbouring cells are not damaged by apoptosis as cytosolic products are safely isolated by membranes prior to undergoing phagocytosis. In the average adult between 50 and 70 billion cells die each day due to apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. Hyperactive apoptosis can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic diseases, and tissue damage.",

Apoptosis is contingent upon ATP levels to form the energy dependent apoptosome. A distinct biochemical event only seen in oncosis is the rapid depletion of intracellular ATP. The lack of intracellular ATP results in a deactivation of sodium and potassium ATPase within the compromised cell membrane. The lack of ion transport at the cell membrane leads to an accumulation of sodium and chloride ions within the cell with a concurrent water influx, contributing to the hallmark cellular swelling of oncosis. As with apoptosis, oncosis has been shown to be genetically programmed and dependent on expression levels of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) in HeLa cells. An increase in UCP-2 levels leads to a rapid decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing mitochondrial NADH and intracellular ATP levels, initiating the oncotic pathway. The anti-apoptotic gene product Bcl-2 is not an active inhibitor of UCP-2 initiated cell death, further distinguishing oncosis and apoptosis as distinct cellular death mechanisms.",

CED-3 is the final protease in the interaction network and is responsible for activating the proteins involved in cell disassembly. CED-9 is said to protect cells from the apoptosis pathway. Under normal conditions, in a cell not experiencing apoptotic signalling, CED-9 forms a complex with CED-4 at the membrane of the mitochondria. This interaction sequesters the pro-apoptotic signalling of CED-4. CED-4 consists of an asymmetric dimer of CED-4a and CED-4b proteins in which CED-9 can specifically recognize and bind CED-4a. This interaction is a highly specific recognition and binding interaction between the N-terminal tails of both proteins. When the cell receives an apoptotic signal via a receptor commonly referred to as a \"death receptor\", the protein EGL-1 is activated. The active EGL-1 binds CED-9 causing a Conformational change that interrupts and inhibits the CED-9 - CED-4 interaction. CED-4 is free to dissociate and activate the CED-3 protease effectively triggering the final stages for apoptosis.",

Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), is a reason of the higher matrix Ca2 + levels, which is acts as a trigger for apoptosis. MOMP is the process before apoptosis, which is accompanied to permeability of the inner membrane of the mitochondria (IMM).  Permeability transition pore (PTP) opening induces mitochondrial swelling and outer membrane of the mitochondria (OMM) rupture. Moreover, PTP opening induce releasing of caspase-activating factors and apoptosis.

During embryonic development, the absence of NGF activates apoptosis by decreasing the activity of the signaling pathways normally activated by NGF. this pathway of apoptosis has also been named the intrinsic pathway, as it is activated by intrinsic factors over external factors. Without NGF, the neurons of the sympathetic nervous system begin to atrophy, glucose uptake rates fall and the rates of protein synthesis and gene expression slow. Apoptotic death from NGF withdrawal also requires caspase activity. Upon NGF withdrawal, caspase-3 activation occurs through an in-vitro pathway beginning with the release of Cytochrome c from the mitochondria. In a surviving sympathetic neuron, the overexpression of anti-apoptotic B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins prevents NGF withdrawal-induced death. However, overexpression of a separate, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene, Bax, stimulates the release of Cytochrome c2. Cytochrome c promotes the activation of caspase-9 through the formation of the apoptosome. Once caspase-9 is activated, it can cleave and activate caspase-3 resulting in cell death. Notably, apoptosis does not release intracellular fluid as neurons that are degraded through ferroptosis do. During ferroptosis, neurons release lipid metabolites from inside the cell body.

CAD cleaves the DNA at the internucleosomal linker sites between the nucleosomes, protein-containing structures that occur in chromatin at ~180-bp intervals.
