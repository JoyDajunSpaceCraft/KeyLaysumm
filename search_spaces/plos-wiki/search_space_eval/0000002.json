Firstly, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme binds to inactive Ub in eukaryotic cells via a thioester bond and mobilises it in an ATP-dependent process. Ub is then transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme before being conjugated to the target protein via an E3 ubiquitin ligase. There exists a multitude of E3 ligases, which differ in structure and substrate specificity to allow selective targeting of proteins to intracellular degradation.",

HIV uses an efficient mechanism to dislocate a single-membrane-spanning host protein, CD4, from the ER and submits it to ERAD.The Vpu protein of HIV-1 is a protein on the ER membrane and targets newly-made CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum for degradation by cytosolic proteasomes. Vpu only utilizes part of the ERAD process to degrade CD4. CD4 is normally a stable protein and is not likely to be a target for ERAD. However, HIV produces the membrane protein Vpu that binds to CD4.The Vpu protein mainly retains the CD4 in the ER by SCF\u03b2-TrCP-dependent ubiquitination of the CD4 cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions. The CD4 Gly415 is a contributor to CD4-Vpu interactions, several TMD-mediated mechanisms by HIV-1 Vpu are necessary to downregulate CD4 and thus promote viral pathogenesis. CD4 retained in the ER will be a target for a variant ERAD pathway rather than predominantly appearing at the plasma membrane without the presence of Vpu through the RESET pathway. Vpu mediates the CD4 retention in the ER and the addition of degradation. As Vpu is phosphorylated, it mimics substrates for the E3 complex SCF. In cells that are infected with HIV, SCF interacts with Vpu and ubiquitinates CD4, which is subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Vpu itself escapes from the degradation.",

Substrates that are unfolded, misfolded, or no longer required for cellular function can also be ubiquitin tagged for degradation by ATP dependent proteases, such as the proteasome in eukaryotes or ClpXP in prokaryotes.

The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class and it may play a role in regulation of hematopoiesis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been identified with the full-length natures of only some variants being determined.",

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class and contains an F-box domain. This protein is highly expressed during muscle atrophy, whereas mice deficient in this gene were found to be resistant to atrophy. This protein is thus a potential drug target for the treatment of muscle atrophy. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two isoforms of different sizes.",

It binds to F-box proteins (proteins containing an F-box motif), such as cyclin F, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, and other regulatory proteins involved in ubiquitin dependent proteolysis. The encoded protein also collaborates with a network of proteins to control beta-catenin levels and affects the activity level of beta-catenin dependent TCF transcription factors. Studies have also characterized the protein as an RNA polymerase II elongation factor. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants.

An E3 uibiquitin ligase complex composed of Cullin 3 (CUL3), speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), and RING-box protein 1 (RBX1) has been shown to mark the Bmi-1 with ubiquitin (a process known as ubiquitination).",
