Upon binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor and coreceptor, a number of conformational changes in the structure leads to the dissociation of gp120 and to the exposure of gp41 and at the same time to the anchoring of the gp41 N-terminal fusion peptide sequence into the host cell. A spring-loaded mechanism is responsible for bringing the viral and cell membranes in close proximity that they will fuse. The origin of the spring-loaded mechanism lies within the exposed gp41, which contains two consecutive heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) following the fusion peptide at the N terminus of the protein. HR1 forms a parallel, trimeric coiled coil onto which HR2 region coils, forming the trimer-of-hairpins (or six-helix bundle) structure, thereby facilitating membrane fusion through bringing the membranes close to each other.

Assembly of progeny virions begins in cytoplasmic viral factories, producing an spherical immature particle. This virus particle matures into the brick-shaped intracellular mature virion (IMV). IMVs can be released upon cell lysis, or can acquire a second membrane from the Golgi apparatus and bud as extracellular enveloped virions (EEV).

Since no MIDV-specific cell entry literature could be found, the Alphavirus entry information that MIDV utilizes will be stated here. After being taken in through endocytosis, a low pH triggers a membrane fusion, which delivers the viral RNA genomes into the cell's cytoplasm. It is not yet know which surface molecule acts as an Alphavirus receptor, but research is looking at cell surface heparan sulfate(HS) as a viable receptor considering its close relation to the E2 protein found on the Alphavirus envelope. Research is also looking at DC-SIGN/L-SIGN as a receptor since it binds to mannose-rich carbohydrates that are often found in mosquitos, the vectors for Alphaviruses and MIDV. Alphaviruses utilize the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. Since presence of the Alphavirus does not have an effect on the number of clathrin-coated vesicles, it is assumed that the alphavirus takes advantage of the cells own processes without alteration. Research has found that this endocytic uptake of alphaviruses can be stopped through injection of anti-clathrin drugs - this could be utilized in the future to make a vaccine. After endocytic uptake, the virus is quickly delivered to the early endosome compartment, where a low pH then lyses the endosome and virus, exposing the cytoplasm to viral nucleocapsid. Cholesterol is also necessary for the Alphavirus to undergo fusion. This fusion of the endosomal membrane to the viral envelope allows the release of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Almost immediately the nucleocapsid is uncoated, exposing the viral RNA to the host cytoplasm",

The M1 protein is required for virus assembly and NP functions in transcription and replication. These viruses also contain proteins on the surface of the cell membrane called glycoproteins.

This enzyme is similar to the enzyme neuraminidase produced by type A and B in that they both function in destroying the host cell receptors. Glycoproteins may undergo mutations (antigenic drift) or reassortment in which a new HA or NA is produced (antigenic shift).

Zika virus is related to the dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. Since the 1950s, it has been known to occur within a narrow equatorial belt from Africa to Asia. From 2007 to , the virus spread eastward, across the Pacific Ocean to the Americas, leading to the 2015\u201316 Zika virus epidemic. The infection, known as Zika fever or Zika virus disease, often causes no or only mild symptoms, similar to a very mild form of dengue fever. While there is no specific treatment, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and rest may help with the symptoms. , the illness cannot be prevented by medications or vaccines. Zika can spread from a pregnant woman to her baby. This can result in microcephaly, severe brain malformations, and other birth defects. Zika infections in adults may result rarely in Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In January 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued travel guidance on affected countries, including the use of enhanced precautions, and guidelines for pregnant women including considering postponing travel. Other governments or health agencies also issued similar travel warnings, while Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Jamaica advised women to postpone getting pregnant until more is known about the risks.

The Zika virus belongs to the family \"Flaviviridae\" family and the genus \"Flavivirus\", thus is related to the dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. Like other flaviviruses, Zika virus is enveloped and icosahedral and has a nonsegmented, single-stranded, 10-kilobase, positive-sense RNA genome. It is most closely related to the Spondweni virus and is one of the two known viruses in the Spondweni virus clade. A positive-sense RNA genome can be directly translated into viral proteins. As in other flaviviruses, such as the similarly sized West Nile virus, the RNA genome encodes seven nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins. One of the structural proteins encapsulates the virus. This protein is the flavivirus envelope glycoprotein, that binds to the endosomal membrane of the host cell to initiate endocytosis. The RNA genome forms a nucleocapsid along with copies of the 12-kDa capsid protein. The nucleocapsid, in turn, is enveloped within a host-derived membrane modified with two viral glycoproteins. Viral genome replication depends on the making of double-stranded RNA from the single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (ssRNA(+)) genome followed by transcription and replication to provide viral mRNAs and new ssRNA(+) genomes.",

Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, particularly in eukaryotes since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome are a few of the many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Fusion is also an important mechanism for transport of lipids from their site of synthesis to the membrane where they are needed. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.",

In molecular biology, haemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoprotein (HEF) is a multi-functional protein embedded in the viral envelope of several viruses, including influenza C virus, coronaviruses and toroviruses. HEF is required for infectivity, and functions to recognise the host cell surface receptor, to fuse the viral and host cell membranes, and to destroy the receptor upon host cell infection. The haemagglutinin region of HEF is responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion, and bears a strong resemblance to the sialic acid-binding haemagglutinin found in influenza A and B viruses, except that it binds 9-O-acetylsialic acid. The esterase region of HEF is responsible for the destruction of the receptor, an action that is carried out by neuraminidase in influenza A and B viruses. The esterase domain is similar in structure to \"Streptomyces scabies\" esterase, and to acetylhydrolase, thioesterase I and rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase.",

Conditions associated with HSV include cold sores and genital herpes, and both HSV and cytomegalovirus can be life-threatening in people who are immunodeficient. Much of Minson's research has investigated herpesvirus replication and life cycle, and viral pathogenesis and the immune response. His work has contributed to understanding the processes by which HSV fuses with the cell membrane and acquires its envelope.

The situation is further complicated when considering fusion \"in vivo\" since biological fusion is almost always regulated by the action of membrane-associated proteins. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Eukaryotic cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.",

Folding@home has also been used to study membrane fusion, an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown. Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.",

Initially identified as an IFN-\u03b3 induced antiviral protein in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infected macrophages, viperin is reported that it could be induced by HCMV glycoprotein B in fibroblasts but inhibits HCMV viral infection and down-regulates viral structural proteins, which is essential for viral assembling and maturation. The mechanism of how the virus protein induces viperin against itself is still not clear. However, the viral induced redistribution of Viperin is also found in HCMV infected cells, which may reflect the mechanism of virus evading antiviral activities of Viperin. Viperin could also be induced, and then interact with HCMV viral proteins and relocate to mitochondria in HCMV viral infected cells, and finally enhance viral infectivity by the disrupted cellular metabolism. In the inhibition of influenza virus budding and release, viperin could disrupt the lipid rafts on cell plasma membrane by decreasing the enzyme activities of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), which is an essential enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. Besides, viperin can also inhibit the viral replication of HCV via the interaction with host protein hVAP-33 and NS5A and disruption of the formation of the replication complex.",

A common feature of all paramyxoviruses is the presence of two membrane-anchored glycoproteins, one required for virion attachment and one required for fusion. It is believed that the F and Hn proteins present on the outer envelope of the virus assist in entry of the virus into the host cell. The fusion protein (F) is an integral membrane protein, sharing many features similar to other viral fusion proteins and is directly involved in virus fusion. It is believed that two heptad repeat regions (HR1) and (HR2) form a six-helix bundle structure that helps to induce fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. The Hn protein is made up of a stalk and a globular head that contains receptor-binding capabilities that bind to sialic acid receptors located on cells in the upper respiratory tract of the host. It is hypothesized that interactions between the Hn and F proteins cause conformational changes in the respective proteins controlling the attachment and fusion of the viral capsid with the host cell membrane.",

Though budding does not immediately destroy the host cell, this process will slowly use up the cell membrane and eventually lead to the cell's demise.
