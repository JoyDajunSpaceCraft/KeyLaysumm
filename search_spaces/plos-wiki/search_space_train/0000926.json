It is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can utilize host phagocytes to spread within the body. \"Cryptococcus neoformans\" was the first intracellular pathogen for which the non-lytic escape process termed vomocytosis was observed. It has been speculated that this ability to manipulate host cells results from environmental selective pressure by amoebae, a hypothesis first proposed by Arturo Casadevall under the term \"accidental virulence\".",

Gastrointestinal nematodes may elicit a variety of host immune responses depending on the initial immune status of the host, parasite species, and environmental conditions.

However, once an infection has occurred, the host\u2019s immune system attempts to limit the damage caused by the worm. Apart from the importance of the extrinsic factors of weather, climate and grazing management, the immune status of cattle is perhaps the most significant of all host factors influencing infection with \"O. ostertagi\". Unlike other common gastrointestinal nematodes of cattle, who are subject to a quick host immune response after relatively short periods of exposure and immune system memory, a protective host immune response against \"O. ostertagi\" requires far longer periods of exposure and is not always permanent. The failure to respond quickly to \"Ostertagia\" may be a result of the suggested immunosuppression or impairment of antibody and cellular responses. \"O. ostertagi\" has been shown to induce cytokines and T-cells in the adaptive immune response in cattle, and recent advances have been made to produce suitable vaccines targeting adult stage \"Ostertagia\".

This led the authors to state that \"C. innocuum\" infection post transplant may be severely underestimated. \"C. innocuum\" has also been implicated in cases of fatal bacteremia as reported in a retrospective study done by Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. Patients that succumbed to the infection (100% mortality) had underlying disease states (malignancy, diabetes or liver disease). While clostridial species only account for 2% of clinical bacteremia, \"C innocuum\" was among the three most commonly isolated bacteria in this study. \"C. innocuum\" has also been isolated in patients with recurrent diarrhea who had prior \"C. difficile\" associated diarrhea. One case of fatal bacterial endocarditis was also found in the literature. This is possibly the only confirmed case of \"C. innocuum\" endocarditis involving the pulmonary and tricuspid valves resulting in multiple emboli and death.",

They are not harmful for the body when the body's immune system is functioning normally, but if the host immune system becomes compromised, or loses its ability to function at its full or near-full potential, opportunistic pathogens switch from being a commensal organism to a pathogen. This is where the name opportunistic pathogen comes from: they are only pathogens when the opportunity to infect the host is there. An example of an opportunistic pathogen is Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a type of fungus/yeast found in the intestines and mucous membranes (like the vagina and throat) of healthy humans. It is also found on the skin of healthy humans. In healthy humans- meaning humans with functioning immune systems- Candida will not cause infections. It will simply co-exist with the host. However, if a person is in chemo therapy or has HIV/AIDS, which weakens the immune system (thus compromising it), Candida albicans will cause infections. It can cause infections as innocuous as yeast infections or thrush and it can cause infections as serious as systemic candidiasis which is fatal in about 50% of cases. Though the mechanisms Candida albicans uses to switch from being a commensal to a pathogen are largely unknown, the reasons for its strength as a pathogen are broadly known. Candida has plenty of phenotypic and genotypic plasticity which means it generates change quickly. As a result of constant diversification, candida has many opportunities to make advantageous mutations. Additionally, Candida can change morphology. It can convert from the yeast for to the filamentous form and vice versa, depending on which stage of infection it is in. In the beginning stages of infection, Candida is more likely to be in the filamentous form because this allows it to adhere to and infect cells more efficiently. Other adaptations of the commensal pathogen include the ability to grow at host temperature, create biofilms, resist reactive oxygen species (ROS) created as part of the human immune response to fight off infection, adapt to different pHs (relevant for being carried in the blood in different parts of the body) and adapt to low nutrient or low glucose environments like the liver Because Candida albicans is very good at adapting to the fluctuating environments of the humans body (i.e. its changing temperature, pH, oxygen reactivity and more) candida albicans is a good pathogen.",

            "document": "Host microbe interactions in Caenorhabditis elegans . One of the best studied natural pathogens of \"C. elegans\" is the microsporidium \"Nematocida parisii\", which was directly isolated from wild-caught \"C. elegans\". \"N. parisii\" is an intracellular parasite that is exclusively transmitted horizontally from one animal to another. The microsporidian spores are likely to exit the cells by disrupting a conserved cytoskeletal structure in the intestine called the terminal web. It seems that none of the known immune pathways of \"C. elegans\" is involved in mediating resistance against \"N. parisii\". Microsporidia were found in several nematodes isolated from different locations, indicating that microsporidia are common natural parasites of \"C. elegans\". The \"N. parisii\"-\"C. elegans\" system represents a very useful tool to study infection mechanisms of intracellular parasites. Additionally, a new species of microsporidia was recently found in a wild caught \"C. elegans\" that genome sequencing places in the same genus \"Nematocida\" as prior microsporidia seen in these nematodes. This new species was named \"Nematocida displodere,\" after a phenotype seen in late infected worms that explode at the vulva to release infectious spores. \"N. displodere\" was shown to infect a broad range of tissues and cell types in \"C. elegans\", including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, seam cells, and coelomocytes. Strangely, the majority of intestinal infection fails to grow to later parasite stages, while the muscle and epidermal infection thrives. This is in stark contrast to \"N. parisii\" which infects and completes its entire life cycle in the \"C. elegans\" intestine. These related \"Nematocida\" species are being used to study the host and pathogen mechanisms responsible for allowing or blocking eukaryotic parasite growth in different tissue niches.  Another eukaryotic pathogen is the fungus \"Drechmeria coniospora\", which has not been directly co-isolated with \"C. elegans\" from nature, but is still considered to be a natural pathogen of \"C. elegans\". \"D. coniospora\" attaches to the cuticle of the worm at the vulva, mouth, and anus and its hyphae penetrate the cuticle. In this way \"D. coniospora\" infects the worm from the outside, while the majority of bacterial pathogens infect the worm from the intestinal lumen",

In Basidiomycota homothallism is not very common and in Agaricomycotina it is estimated that only 10% of species have homothallic mating behavior. For example, one subspecies of the ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycete \"Sistotrema brinkmannii\" is homothallic, although other subspecies have maintained their ability to outcross. Also, a variety of the edible mushroom \"Agaricus bisporus\", (\"A. bisporus var. eurotetrasporus\") produces haploid self-fertile basidiospores. Additionally, in the human pathogen \"C. neoformans\" known to outcross under laboratory conditions, both mating types are not normally distributed in natural populations, with the \u03b1 mating type much more commonly found (>99%), suggesting homothallism is the most prevalent mode of sexual reproduction in \u00b4\"C. neoformans\" in nature. Finally, the fungus causing witches' broom in cacao, \"Moniliophthora perniciosa\", has a primarily homothallic biology despite having \"A\" and \"B\" mating type-like genes in its genome.",

Some \"C. neoformans\" can survive inside macrophages, which appears to be the basis for latency, disseminated disease, and resistance to antifungal agents. One mechanism by which \"C. neoformans\" survives the hostile macrophage environment is by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. Another mechanism involves meiosis. The majority of \"C. neoformans\" are mating \"type a\". Filaments of mating \"type a\" ordinarily have haploid nuclei, but they can become diploid (perhaps by endoduplication or by stimulated nuclear fusion) to form blastospores. The diploid nuclei of blastospores can undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can be dispersed. This process is referred to as monokaryotic fruiting. this process requires a gene called \"DMC1\", which is a conserved homologue of genes \"recA\" in bacteria and \"RAD51\" in eukaryotes, that mediates homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Thus, \"C. neoformans\" can undergo a meiosis, monokaryotic fruiting, that promotes recombinational repair in the oxidative, DNA damaging environment of the host macrophage, and the repair capability may contribute to its virulence.",

            "document": "Candida tropicalis . The most important and most essential step to prevent contact with the fungi species is by washing the hands. There are several types of therapy for the different level of infections caused by \"C. tropicalis\". Normally, antifungal agents are used to treat these infections. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is the most common treatment antifungal agent used to treat \"Candida\" infections. Topical antifungal agents are commonly taken in 3 forms: oral suspension, ointment and powder. Oral suspension is mainly used to treat thrush whereas ointment is directly applied onto the infected section. Nystatin is a type of antifungal agent used because it is not absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. These types of agents will function to lower candida species\u2019 phospholipases activities. Flucytosine (5FC) is another type of therapy treatment including 3 agents used; caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin. Usage of caspofungin will efficiently target against oropharyngeal and oesophgeal candidiasis and invasive candidiasis. Micafungin, compared to amphotericin B, it is more efficient. Anidulafungin results are similar to Caspofungin and Micafungin. echinocandin are a type of non-competitive inhibitors of cell wall 1,3-b-D-glucan synthase complex mainly used to treat fungal infections. Azoles are agents that can deplete ergosterol, the main component of the fungus cell wall membrane, in order to inhibit fungal growth. fluconazole is water soluble, ready to be taken orally. \"C. tropicalis\" can rapidly develop resistance towards fluconazole therefore it\u2019s not recommended to retreat fluconazole-treated patients with recurrent candidiasis. Other azoles that are highly active against \"C. tropicalis\" are itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole and isavuconazole. Voriconazole is a new generation from fluconazole with a higher potential of broad spectrum activity. All of the mentioned treatments and drug therapies can also be applied onto neonates and premature newborns taking into account the amount of recommended dose. Although there are several ways to treat the different types of \"C. tropicalis\"\u2019 infections, the best way to improve treatments results is to improve host immune system.",
