In many insect species, such as \"Drosophila melanogaster\", researchers found that a natural infection with the bacteria strain \"Wolbachia\" \"pipientis\" increases the fitness of the host by increasing resistance to RNA viral infections. Robert L. Glaser and Mark A. Meola investigated \"Wolbachia\"-induced resistance to West Nile virus (WNV) in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" (fruit flies). Two groups of fruit flies were naturally infected with \"Wolbachia.\" Glaser and Meola then cured one group of fruit flies of \"Wolbachia using\" tetracycline. Both the infected group and the cured groups were then infected with WNV. \u00a0Flies infected with \"Wolbachia\" were found to have a changed phenotype that caused resistance to WNV. The phenotype was found to be caused by a \u201cdominant, maternally transmitted, cytoplasmic factor\u201d. The WNV-resistance phenotype was then reversed by curing the fruit flies of \"Wolbachia.\" Since \"Wolbachia\" is also maternally transmitted, it was found that the WNV-resistant phenotype is directly related to the \"Wolbachia\" infection. West Nile virus is transmitted to humans and animals through the Southern house mosquito, \"Culex quinquefasciatus.\" Glaser and Meola knew vector compatibility could be reduced through \"Wolbachia\" infection due to studies done with other species of mosquitoes, mainly, \"Aedes aegypti\". Their goal was to transfer WNV resistance to \"Cx. quinquefasciatus\" by inoculating the embryos of the mosquito with the same strain of \"Wolbachia\" that naturally occurred in the fruit flies. Upon infection, \"Cx. quinquefasciatus\" showed an increased resistance to WNV that was transferable to offspring. The ability to genetically modify mosquitoes in the lab and then have the infected mosquitoes transmit it to their offspring showed that it was possible to transmit the bacteria to wild populations to decrease human infections.",

Both viruses replicated in the entire respiratory tract, but only swine H2N3 could be isolated from lung tissue on day 6 post infection. All animals cleared the infection whereas swine H2N3 infected macaques still presented with pathologic changes indicative of chronic pneumonia at day 14 post infection.

Viruses are able to initiate infection, disperse throughout the body, and replicate due to virulence characteristics. Mechanisms of pathogenesis of viral diseases include: implantation of the virus at the portal of entry, local replication, spread to target organs, and shedding of the virus into the environment. There are several factors that affect pathogenic mechanisms. Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must overpower several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers, host defenses, and conflicting cellular susceptibilities. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals and different races due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.",

About 20% of people develop a fever, headache, vomiting, or a rash. In less than 1% of people, encephalitis or meningitis occurs, with associated neck stiffness, confusion, or seizures. Recovery may take weeks to months. The risk of death among those in whom the nervous system is affected is about 10%. West Nile virus (WNV) is typically spread by infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds. Rarely the virus is spread through blood transfusions, organ transplants, or from mother to baby during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. It otherwise does not spread directly between people. Risks for severe disease include age over 60 and other health problems. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and blood tests. There is no human vaccine. The best method to reduce the risk of infections is avoiding mosquito bites. This may be done by eliminating standing pools of water, such as in old tires, buckets, gutters, and swimming pools. Mosquito repellent, window screens, mosquito nets, and avoiding areas where mosquitoes occur may also be useful. While there is no specific treatment, pain medications may be useful. WNV has occurred in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America. In the United States thousands of cases are reported a year, with most occurring in August and September. It can occur in outbreaks of disease. The virus was discovered in Uganda in 1937 and was first detected in North America in 1999. Severe disease may also occur in horses and a vaccine for these animals is available. A surveillance system in birds is useful for early detection of a potential human outbreak. The incubation period for WNV\u2014the amount of time from infection to symptom onset\u2014is typically from between 2 and 15 days. Headache can be a prominent symptom of WNV fever, meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and it may or may not be present in poliomyelitis-like syndrome.

WEE is a recombinant virus between two other alphaviruses, an ancestral Sindbis virus-like virus, and an ancestral Eastern equine encephalitis virus-like virus. There have been under 700 confirmed cases in the U.S. since 1964. This virus contains an envelope that is made up of glycoproteins and nucleic acids. The virus is transmitted to people and horses by bites from infected mosquitoes (\"Culex tarsalis\") and birds during wet, summer months.  In the U.S. WEE is seen primarily in states and Canadian provinces west of the Mississippi River. The disease is also seen in countries of South America. WEE is commonly a subclinical infection; symptomatic infections are uncommon. However, the disease can cause serious sequelae in infants and children. Unlike Eastern equine encephalitis, the overall mortality of WEE is low (approximately 4%) and is associated mostly with infection in the elderly. Approximately 15-20% of horses that acquire the virus will die or be put down. There is no vaccine for WEE and there are no licensed therapeutic drugs in the U.S. for this infection. According to the CDC, geographic occurrence for this virus is worldwide, and tends to be more prevalent in places in and around swampy areas where human populations tend to be limited.

The two most prominent species that transmit viruses are \"Aedes aegypti\" and \"Aedes albopictus\" which transmit the viruses that cause dengue fever, yellow fever, West Nile fever, chikungunya, eastern equine encephalitis, and Zika virus, along with many other, less notable diseases. Infections with these viruses are typically accompanied by a fever, and, in some cases, encephalitis, which can lead to death. A vaccine to provide protection from yellow fever exists, and measures to prevent mosquito bites include: insecticides such as DDT, mosquito traps, insect repellents, and mosquito nets.",

The connection between arthropods and disease was not postulated until 1881 when Cuban doctor and scientist Carlos Finlay proposed that yellow fever may be transmitted by mosquitoes instead of human contact, a reality that was verified by Major Walter Reed in 1901. The primary vector, \"Aedes aegypti\", had spread globally from the 15th to the 19th centuries as a result of globalization and the slave trade. This geographic spreading caused dengue fever epidemics throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, and later, in 1906, transmission by the \"Aedes\" mosquitoes was confirmed, making yellow fever and dengue fever the first two diseases known to be caused by viruses. Thomas Milton Rivers published the first clear description of a virus as distinct from a bacterium in 1927. The discovery of the West Nile virus came in 1937, and has since been found in \"Culex\" populations causing epidemics throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. In 1999, the virus was introduced into the Western Hemisphere, sparking a series of epidemics. During the latter half of the 20th century, Dengue fever reemerged as a global disease, with the virus spreading geographically due to urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming, and continues to cause at least 50 million infections per year, making Dengue fever the most common and clinically important arboviral disease.",

In the hamster model of yellow fever, early administration of the antiviral ribavirin is an effective early treatment of many pathological features of the disease. Ribavirin treatment during the first five days after virus infection improved survival rates, reduced tissue damage in the liver and spleen, prevented hepatocellular steatosis, and normalised levels of alanine aminotransferase, a liver damage marker. The mechanism of action of ribavirin in reducing liver pathology in yellow fever virus infection may be similar to its activity in treatment of hepatitis C, a related virus. Because ribavirin had failed to improve survival in a virulent rhesus model of yellow fever infection, it had been previously discounted as a possible therapy.  Infection was reduced in mosquitoes with the wMel strain of \"Wolbachia\".",

Despite the prior assumptions, D7 can modulate the host cell and act against the virus to prevent virus infection. Unfortunately D7 proteins provoke immune responses, which raise anti-D7 antibody levels. These antibodies inhibit the function of D7 proteins, which enhance transmission of dengue virus.",

Once female Asian tiger mosquitos have contracted the infection, they produce more eggs, give birth more frequently, and live longer than uninfected females. In this way, \"Wolbachia\" provides a fitness advantage to the infected females and prevents uninfected females from reproducing. This allows control of the spread of diseases that many species carry by suppressing reproduction of the individuals with the harmful disease, but without the \"Wolbachia\" infection. \"Wolbachia\" can also be used to transfer certain genes into the population to further control the spread of diseases.",
