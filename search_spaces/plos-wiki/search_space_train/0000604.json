Oxidation response is stimulated by a disturbance in the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant responses, known as oxidative stress. Active species of oxygen naturally occur in aerobic cells and have both intracellular and extracellular sources. These species, if not controlled, damage all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids and DNA. Hence cells need to maintain a strong defense against the damage.  The following table gives an idea of the antioxidant defense system in bacterial system. Small changes in cellular oxidant status can be sensed by specific proteins which regulate a set of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes. Such a global response induces an adaptive metabolism including ROS elimination, the bypass of injured pathways, reparation of oxidative damages and maintenance of reducing power.",

TOP1 regulates the importation of antioxidant enzymes to the chloroplast. These antioxidant enzymes reduce the ROS levels within the organelle. It has been suggested also that TOP1 allows the importation of enzymes that catalyze SA synthesis. On the other hand, TOP2 controls the amount of signaling peptides, important for PCD, in the cytosol.

Reactive oxygen species are produced by the enzyme NADPH oxidase, which transfers electrons from NADPH to oxygen, synthesizing a superoxide, which is a reactive free radical. This superoxide can react to form hydrogen peroxide and a reactive oxygen species. The enzyme NADPH oxidase is able to generate more reactive oxygen species in the presence of arsenic, due to the subunit p22phax, which is responsible for the electron transfer, being upregulated by arsenic. The reactive oxygen species are capable of stressing the endoplasmic reticulum, which increases the amount of the unfolded protein response signals. This leads to inflammation, cell proliferation, and eventually to cell death. Another mechanism in which reactive oxygen species cause cell death would be through the cytoskeleton rearrangement, which affects the contractile proteins. The reactive nitrogen species arise once the reactive oxygen species destroy the mitochondria. This leads to the formation of the reactive nitrogen species, which are responsible for damaging DNA in arsenic poisoning. Mitochondrial damage is known to cause the release of reactive nitrogen species, due to the reaction between superoxides and nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide (NO) is a part of cell regulation, including cellular metabolism, growth, division and death. Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with reactive oxygen species to form peroxynitrite. In cases of chronic arsenic exposure, the nitric oxide levels are depleted, due to the superoxide reactions.

These analyses were carried out under state 3 metabolic conditions, that is, non-limiting amounts of substrate and cofactors to simulate an energy turnover demand similar to that of high-intensity exercise. However, when a fatty acid substrate was tested, a reduction in the capacity of different muscle types to oxidize the long-chain fatty acid, palmitate, was observed. This latter finding is in agreement with the observation that muscles exposed to spaceflight increase the level of stored lipid within their myofibers. Additionally, use of the metabolic pathway for glucose uptake is increased in muscles undergoing HS. Thus, while the enzyme data are equivocal, it appears that in response to states of unloading, some shift in substrate preference may occur whereby carbohydrates are preferentially utilized based on utilization capability.

Catalase and superoxide dismutase ameliorate the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively, by converting these compounds into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (which is later converted to water), resulting in the production of benign molecules. However, this conversion is not 100% efficient, and residual peroxides persist in the cell. While ROS are produced as a product of normal cellular functioning, excessive amounts can cause deleterious effects. Memory capabilities decline with age, evident in human degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of oxidative damage and its implications for aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils.

Some researchers believe that cancer may be caused by aneuploidy (numerical and structural abnormalities in chromosomes) rather than by mutations or epimutations. Cancer has also been considered as a metabolic disease in which the cellular metabolism of oxygen is diverted from the pathway that generates energy (oxidative phosphorylation) to the pathway that generates reactive oxygen species (figure). This causes an energy switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg's hypothesis) and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress (oxidative stress theory of cancer). All these theories of carcinogenesis may be complementary rather than contradictory. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns \u2013 hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue \u2013 have been associated with a large number of human malignancies.

Chronic exposure to high level of nitrogen dioxide results in the allosteric inhibition of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase, both of which are important enzymes found in the mucous membrane antioxidant defense system, that catalyse nucleophilic attack by reduced glutathione (GSH) on non-polar compounds that contain an electrophillic carbon and nitrogen. These inhibition mechanisms generates free radicals that causes peroxidation from the lipids in the mucous membrane leading to increased peroxidized eyrthrocyte lipids, a reaction that proceeds by a free radical chain reaction mechanism that result in oxidative stress. The oxidative stress on the mucous membrane causes the dissociation of the GSTp-JNK complex, oligomerization of GSTP and induction of the JNK pathway, resulting in apoptosis or inflammation of the bronchioles and pulmonary alveolus in mild cases. On migrating to the bloodstream, nitrogen dioxide poisoning results in an irreversible inhibition of the erythrocite membrane acetylcholinesterase which may lead to muscular paralysis, convulsions, bronchoconstriction, the narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchi and bronchioles) and death by asphyxiation.  It also causes a decrease in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase which may results in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency known as favism, a condition that predisposes to hemolysis (spontaneous destruction of red blood cells). Acute and chronic exposure also reduces glutathione reductase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form glutathione (GSH), which is a critical molecule in resisting \"oxidative stress\" and maintaining the reducing environment of the cell.",

Although the full scope of ALDH3A1\u2019s function is yet to be firmly established, there is strong evidence suggesting that ALDH3A1 serves to maintain the cellular redox balance as well as the structural integrity and transparency of the cornea. One study elucidates that ALDH3A1 not only indirectly protects the cornea from UVR induced oxidative stress by metabolizing aldehydes, but also protects the tissue directly, by competitively absorbing UVR in a \u201csuicide response\u201d that reduces damage to other proteins of the cornea In fact, 50% percent of the UVR that the cornea is exposed to is absorbed by ADLH3A1. ALDH3A1\u2019s absorption of UVR oxidizes several key amino acid residues, leading to conformational changes that convert the alpha and beta sheets into random coils. These conformational changes ultimately relieve the dimer structure. This loss of secondary and tertiary structure leads to protein aggregation and complete loss of enzymatic activity. Peptide mapping and spectroscopic experiments reveal that the loss of activity is not a result of Cys244 oxidation (which, together with the active site, remains intact during photo-excitation), but instead, due to the degradation of other key amino residues (most notably methionine and tryptophan). These amino acid residues degrade under oxidative stress, leading to the formation of non-reducible cross-links that stabilize the soluble aggregates. Tryptophan for instance is doubly oxidized to generate ROSs such as HO, which elicit further oxidation and adduction. Nevertheless, the abundance of ALDH3A1 in the cornea ensures that this suicide response neither impedes with aldehyde metabolism nor leads to the formation of insoluble aggregates that would affect the transparency of the cornea.",

            "document": "Cofactor engineering . In cofactor engineering, a metabolic pathway is altered by changing the concentrations of specific cofactors that are produced either in that particular pathway or in a separate pathway. For example, an hypothetical organism could have two arbitrary pathways called A and B where some enzymes in both A and B utilize the same cofactors. If scientists wanted to decrease the output of pathway A, they may first consider directly engineering the enzymes involved in A, perhaps to decrease a particular active site's affinity for its substrate. In some cases however, the enzymes in A may be difficult to engineer for various reasons, or it may be impossible to engineer them without dangerously affecting some third metabolic pathway C, which utilizes the same enzymes. As a separate option, scientists could increase the flux of B, which may be easier to engineer. This in turn could \"tie up\" the cofactors needed by A, which would slow enzymatic activity, decreasing output in A. This is one hypothetical example of how cofactor engineering can be used, but there are many other unique cases where scientists use cofactors as a way of altering metabolic pathways. A major advantage to cofactor engineering is that scientists can use it to successfully alter metabolic pathways that are difficult to engineer by means of ordinary metabolic engineering. This is achieved by targeting more easily engineered enzymes in separate pathways, which use the same cofactors. Since many cofactors are used by different enzymes in multiple pathways, cofactor engineering may be an efficient, cost effective alternative to current methods of metabolic engineering. Yeast are commonly used in the beer and wine industry because they are capable of efficiently producing ethanol through the metabolic pathway fermentation in the absence of oxygen. Fermentation requires the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) which depends on the cofactor NADH. This pathway involves the conversion of glucose to both ethanol and glycerol, both of which use NADH as a cofactor. Scientists engineered \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" to overproduce GPDH, which shifted the cells metabolic flux away from ethanol and toward glycerol, by limiting NADH availability in the ethanol production portion of the pathway. The opposite effect was achieved by influencing a separate pathway in the cell, the Glutamate Synthesis pathway. Inactivating the expression of the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which is NADPH dependent, and over expressing the enzymes glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase, which rely on NADH as a cofactor shifted the cofactor balance in glutamate synthesis pathway. The pathway is now dependent on NADH rather than NADPH, which decreases NADH availability in the fermentation pathway. This in turn causes increased ethanol production and decreased glycerol production. This method of manipulating metabolic fluxes could be visualized much like global fuel markets, where the increased production of ethanol for use in the automotive industry would decrease its availability in the food industry. Essentially, producing more engines which run on ethanol could result in decreased consumption of processed sweets, which contain high fructose corn syrup. This engineering of cofactors is applicable to the beer and wine industry since it allows for the regulation of ethanol levels in alcoholic beverages. Advancements in the wine industry have caused a steady increase in ethanol content, so winemakers in particular would be interested in the possibility of reducing the ethanol levels of some of their wines.",

Most long-term effects are caused by damage to DNA. DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation is similar to oxidative stress, and these lesions have been implicated in aging and cancer. Biological effects of single-base damage by radiation or oxidation, such as 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol, have been extensively studied. Recently the focus has shifted to some of the more complex lesions. Tandem DNA lesions are formed at substantial frequency by ionizing radiation and metal-catalyzed HO reactions. Under anoxic conditions, the predominant double-base lesion is a species in which C8 of guanine is linked to the 5-methyl group of an adjacent 3'-thymine (G[8,5- Me]T). Most of these oxygen-derived species are produced by normal aerobic metabolism. Normal cellular defense mechanisms destroy most of these. Repair of oxidative damages to DNA is frequent and ongoing, largely keeping up with newly induced damages. In rat urine about 74,000 oxidative DNA adducts per cell per day are excreted.

One study elucidates that ALDH3A1 not only indirectly protects the cornea from UVR induced oxidative stress by metabolizing aldehydes, but also protects the tissue directly, by competitively absorbing UVR in a \u201csuicide response\u201d that reduces damage to other proteins of the cornea In fact, 50% percent of the UVR that the cornea is exposed to is absorbed by ADLH3A1. ALDH3A1\u2019s absorption of UVR oxidizes several key amino acid residues, leading to conformational changes that convert the alpha and beta sheets into random coils. These conformational changes ultimately relieve the dimer structure. This loss of secondary and tertiary structure leads to protein aggregation and complete loss of enzymatic activity. Peptide mapping and spectroscopic experiments reveal that the loss of activity is not a result of Cys244 oxidation (which, together with the active site, remains intact during photo-excitation), but instead, due to the degradation of other key amino residues (most notably methionine and tryptophan). These amino acid residues degrade under oxidative stress, leading to the formation of non-reducible cross-links that stabilize the soluble aggregates. Tryptophan for instance is doubly oxidized to generate ROSs such as HO, which elicit further oxidation and adduction. Nevertheless, the abundance of ALDH3A1 in the cornea ensures that this suicide response neither impedes with aldehyde metabolism nor leads to the formation of insoluble aggregates that would affect the transparency of the cornea.",

            "document": "Cell-Cycle Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease . Acute oxidative injury in most mature neurons will induce the neurons to enter G1 along an apoptotic pathway. However, in the AD brain, neurons do not show signs of apoptosis as would be expected under conditions of acute oxidative stress (Perry et al., 1998). Instead, it is proposed that after being subjected to oxidative injury, AD neurons possess genetic defects which allow them to enter and stay in G1 instead of proceeding towards apoptosis. This adaptive response produces an \u201coxidative steady state\u201d in the AD neuron, characterized by relatively low intracellular concentrations of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide which explains the reduced levels of neuronal apoptosis (Wiese et al. 1995). Persistent oxidative stress in pre-AD and AD cases may result in an irreversible oxidative steady state, in which neurons which have neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) can survive for decades (Morsch et al., 1999). AD NFT-bearing neurons have been shown to under or over-expression of over 225 genes which have protein products involved in oxidative stress (Dunckley et al., 2006). Chronic oxidative stress also inhibits the downstream propagation of caspase-mediated apoptotic signals, which is the second hit in the 2-hit hypothesis of AD (Hampton et al. 1998).",

In human lung cells, ROS has been shown to inhibit the M2 isozyme of pyruvate kinase (PKM2). ROS achieves this inhibition by oxidizing Cys358 and inactivating PKM2. As a result of PKM2 inactivation, glucose flux is no longer converted into pyruvate, but is instead utilized in the pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in the reduction and detoxification of ROS. In this manner, the harmful effects of ROS are increased and cause greater oxidative stress on the lung cells, leading to potential tumor formation. This inhibitory mechanism is important because it may suggest that the regulatory mechanisms in PKM2 are responsible for aiding cancer cell resistance to oxidative stress and enhanced tumorigenesis.",

Many theories of the cause of PD symptoms point to the death of dopamine-producing neurons within the central nervous system due to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress is caused by metabolism and the production of molecules known as free radicals. Accumulation of these free radicals within the brain can cause damage to neurons. Additionally, dopamine producing neurons are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress due to the relatively high levels of metabolism associated with the production of dopamine, resulting in comparatively higher amounts of free radicals being produced by these dopamine-producing neurons. The effects of dopamine within the brain are widespread, including the control of voluntary motor control. With the death of these dopamine-producing cells within an area of the mid-brain known as the substantia nigra, the central nervous system has less control over the body, resulting in the tremors and rigidity seen in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

            "document": "Porphyria cutanea tarda . The dermatological symptoms of PCT that include blistering and lesions on sun-exposed areas of the skin are caused by a buildup of porphyrin compounds (specifically uroporphyrinogen) close to the surface of the skin that have been oxidized by free radicals or sunlight. The oxidized porphyrins initiate degranulation of dermal mast cells, which release proteases that catabolize the surrounding proteins. This begins a cell mediated positive feedback loop which matches the description of a type 4 delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The resulting blisters therefore do not appear immediately, but begin to show up 2\u20133 days after sun exposure. Due to the highly conjugated structure of porphyrins involving alternating single and double carbon bonds, these compounds exhibit a deep purple color, resulting in the discoloration observed in the skin. Excess alcohol intake decreases hepcidin production which leads to increased iron absorption from the gut and an increase in oxidative stress. This oxidative stress then leads to inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, creating an excess of uroporphyrinogen III which is oxidized from the relatively harmless porphyrinogens into their reduced porphyrins form. Concentrated instances of oxidative stress (alcohol, physical trauma, psychological stress, etc) cause the liver to hemorrhage these porphyrins into the blood stream where they are then susceptible to oxidation. The strong association of PCT with Hepatitis C infection is not entirely understood. Studies have suggested that the cytopathic effect of the virus on hepatocytes can lead to the release of free iron. This iron can disrupt the activity of cytochrome p450, releasing activated oxygen species. These can oxidize the UROD substrate uroporphyrinogen, which can result in the inhibition of UROD and lead to deficient activity of this key enzyme.",
