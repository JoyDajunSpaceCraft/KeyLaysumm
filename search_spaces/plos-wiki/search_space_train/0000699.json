The biological sample can be a cell, a cellular organelle, an organ, a tissue, a tissue extract, a biofluid or an entire organism. The small molecule chemicals found in a given metabolome may include both endogenous metabolites that are naturally produced by an organism (such as amino acids, organic acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, amines, sugars, vitamins, co-factors, pigments, antibiotics, etc.) as well as exogenous chemicals (such as drugs, environmental contaminants, food additives, toxins and other xenobiotics) that are not naturally produced by an organism. In other words, there is both an endogenous metabolome and an exogenous metabolome. The endogenous metabolome can be further subdivided to include a \"primary\" and a \"secondary\" metabolome (particularly when referring to plant or microbial metabolomes). A primary metabolite is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important ecological function. Secondary metabolites may include pigments, antibiotics or waste products derived from partially metabolized xenobiotics. To qualify as a metabolite, or to be considered to be part of the metabolome, a small molecule must typically have a molecular weight <1500 Da. This means that molecules such as glycolipids, polysaccharides, short peptides (<14 amino acids) and small oligonucleotides (<5 bases) can be regarded as metabolites or constituents of the metabolome. On the other hand, very large macromolecules such as proteins, messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, microRNA and DNA are definitely not metabolites and are not considered to be part of the metabolome. The study of the metabolome is called metabolomics.",

Harris' lab studies the mechanism of dengue virus infection of human dendritic cells. The lab is also developing a mouse model to study viral tropism and the immune response to dengue virus infection, to generate a better model of the disease. Harris' fieldwork focuses on molecular and epidemiological field studies of dengue in endemic Latin American countries, particularly in Nicaragua. Ongoing fieldwork projects include clinical and biological studies of severe dengue, a pediatric cohort study of dengue transmission in Managua, and a project on evidence-based, community-derived interventions for prevention of dengue via control of its mosquito vector. Harris is currently initiating studies of dengue pathogenesis in humans, focusing on functional characterization of antibodies and B cell memory response, host gene expression profiling, and viral factors such as quasispecies. Harris is also collaborating with investigators at the UC Berkeley College of Engineering to develop the ImmunoSensor: a novel, rapid, low-cost diagnostic device for point-of-care diagnosis of dengue and other infectious diseases.

Epoxygenases are a set of membrane-bound, heme-containing cytochrome P450 (CYP P450 or just CYP) enzymes that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to epoxide products that have a range of biological activities. The most thoroughly studied substrate of the CYP epoxylgenases is arachidonic acid. This polyunsaturated fatty acid is metabolized by cyclooxygenases to various prostaglandin, thromboxane, and prostacyclin metabolites in what has been termed the first pathway of eicosanoid production; it is also metabolized by various lipoxygenases to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (e.g. 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid) and leukotrienes (e.g. leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4) in what has been termed the second pathway of eicosanoid production. The metabolism of arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids by the CYP epoxygenases has been termed the third pathway of eicosanoid metabolism. Like the first two pathways of eicosanoid production, this third pathway acts as a signaling pathway wherein a set of enzymes (the epoxygenases) metabolize arachidonic acid to a set of products (the eicosatrienoic acid epoxides, abbreviated as EETs, which are classified as nonclassic eicosanoids) that act as secondary signals to work in activating their parent or nearby cells and thereby orchestrate functional responses. However, none of these three pathways is limited to metabolizing arachidonic acid to eicosanoids. Rather, they also metabolize other polyunsaturated fatty acids to products that are structurally analogous to the eicosanoids but often have different bioactivity profiles. This is particularly true for the CYP epoxygenases which in general act on a broader range of polyunsaturated fatty acids to form a broader range of metabolites than the first and second pathways of eicosanoid production. Furthermore, the latter pathways form metabolites many of which act on cells by binding with and thereby activating specific and well-characterized receptor proteins; no such receptors have been fully characterized for the epoxide metabolites. Finally, there are relatively few metabolite-forming lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases in the first and second pathways and these oxygenase enzymes share similarity between humans and other mammalian animal models. The third pathway consists of a large number of metabolite-forming CYP epoxygenases and the human epoxygenases have important differences from those of animal models. Partly because of these differences, it has been difficult to define clear roles for the epoxygenase-epoxide pathways in human physiology and pathology.",

Although the metabolome can be defined readily enough, it is not currently possible to analyse the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method. The first metabolite database(called METLIN) for searching m/z values from mass spectrometry data was developed by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute in 2005.

Through most of its early period of study, acute inflammatory responses were regarded as self-limiting innate immune system reactions to invading foreign organisms, tissue injuries, and other insults. These reactions were orchestrated by various soluble signaling agents such as a) foreign organism-derived N-formylated oligopeptide chemotactic factors (e.g. N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine); b) complement components C5a and C3a which are chemotactic factors formed during the activation of the host's blood complement system by invading organisms or injured tissues; and c) host cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin 1s), host-derived pro-inflammatory chemokines (e.g. CXCL8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10), platelet-activating factor, and PUFA metabolites including in particular leukotrienes (e.g. LTB4), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (e.g., 5-HETE, 12-HETE), the hydroxylated heptadecatreineoic acid, 12-HHT, and oxoeicosanoids (e.g. 5-oxo-ETE). These agents functioned as pro-inflammatory signals by increasing the permeability of local blood vessels; activating tissue-bound pro-inflammatory cells such as mast cells, and macrophages; and attracting to nascent inflammatory sites and activating circulating neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, gamma delta T cells, and Natural killer T cells. The cited cells then proceeded to neutralize invading organisms, limit tissue injury, and initiate tissue repair. Hence, the classic inflammatory response was viewed as fully regulated by the soluble signaling agents. That is, the agents formed, orchestrated an inflammatory cell response, but then dissipated to allow resolution of the response. In 1974, however, Charles N. Serhan and his renowned colleagues, Mats Hamberg and Bengt Samuelsson, discovered that human neutrophils metabolize arachidonic acid to two novel products that contain 3 hydroxyl residues and 4 double bonds viz., 5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,11,13-icosatetraenoic acid and 5,14,15-trihydroxy-6,8,10,12-icosatetraenoic acid. These products are now termed lipoxin A4 and B4, respectively. While initially found to have in vitro activity suggesting that they might act as pro-inflammatory agents, Serhan and colleagues and other groups found that the lipoxins as well as a large number of newly discovered metabolites of other PUFA possess primarily if not exclusively anti-inflammatory activities and therefore may be crucial for causing the resolution of inflammation. In this view, inflammatory responses are not self-limiting but rather limited by the formation of a particular group of PUFA metabolites that counteract the actions of pro-inflammatory signals. Later, these PUFA metabolites were classified together and termed specialized pro-resolving mediators (i.e. SPM).",

This approach can then be applied to the prediction of response to a pharmaceutical compound by patients with a particular metabolic profile.

For example, LPCs increase the bactericidal activity of rodent neutrophils, enhance hydrogen peroxide production in rodent neutrophils triggered by the ingestion of bacteria, stimulate the chemotaxis of human monocytes, and protect mice from the lethal effects of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis endotoxin. G2A may similarly be responsible for the activities of other phospholipids which, like LPC have not been shown to bind to G2A but still require G2A for certain of their activities viz., lysophosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine; these two lyso-phospholipids stimulate calcium signaling pathways in human neutrophils by a G2A dependent mechanism. Furthermore, activated neutrophils greatly increase their surface membrane content of lysophosphatidylserine. In a mouse model, mouse neutrophils with increased levels of lysophosphatidylserine on their surface membrane due to cell activation or artificial addition showed an increase in there engulfment by mouse macrophages in vitro that was dependent on the expression of G2A in the macrophages and an increased rate of clearance in mice by a mechanism that was dependent on the expression of G2A by the mice.

Though not always the case, omega 6 fatty acids promote inflammation of the skin which in turn reduces overall appearance and health. There are skin benefits of both these lipids, as a deficiency in omega 6s leads to a reduced ability to heal and a higher risk of infection, which also diminishes skin health.

The production and activities of the SPM suggest a new view of inflammation wherein the initial response to foreign organisms, tissue injury, or other insults involves numerous soluble cell signaling molecules that not only recruit various cell types to promote inflammation but concurrently cause these cells to produce SPM which feed back on their parent and other cells to dampen their pro-inflammatory activity and to promote repair. Resolution of an inflammatory response is thus an active rather than self-limiting process which is set into motion at least in part by the initiating pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin D2) which instruct relevant cells to produce SPM and to assume a more anti-inflammatory phenotype. Resolution of the normal inflammatory response, then, may involve switching production of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory PUFA metabolites. Excessive inflammatory responses to insult as well as many pathological inflammatory responses that contribute to diverse diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Inflammatory bowel disease, etc. (see Inflammation#Inflammatory disorders) may reflect, in part, a failure in this class switching. Diseases caused or worsened by non-adaptive inflammatory responses may by amenable to treatment with SPM or synthetic SPM which, unlike natural SPM, resist in vivo metabolic inactivation.

At the beginning, the hepatocytes present small fat vacuoles (liposomes) around the nucleus (microvesicular fatty change). In this stage, liver cells are filled with multiple fat droplets that do not displace the centrally located nucleus. In the late stages, the size of the vacuoles increases, pushing the nucleus to the periphery of the cell, giving characteristic signet ring appearance (macrovesicular fatty change). These vesicles are well-delineated and optically \"empty\" because fats dissolve during tissue processing. Large vacuoles may coalesce and produce fatty cysts, which are irreversible lesions. Macrovesicular steatosis is the most common form and is typically associated with alcohol, diabetes, obesity, and corticosteroids. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy and Reye's syndrome are examples of severe liver disease caused by microvesicular fatty change. The diagnosis of steatosis is made when fat in the liver exceeds 5\u201310% by weight. Defects in fatty acid metabolism are responsible for pathogenesis of FLD, which may be due to imbalance in energy consumption and its combustion, resulting in lipid storage, or can be a consequence of peripheral resistance to insulin, whereby the transport of fatty acids from adipose tissue to the liver is increased. Impairment or inhibition of receptor molecules (PPAR-\u03b1, PPAR-\u03b3 and SREBP1) that control the enzymes responsible for the oxidation and synthesis of fatty acids appears to contribute to fat accumulation. In addition, alcoholism is known to damage mitochondria and other cellular structures, further impairing cellular energy mechanism. On the other hand, non-alcoholic FLD may begin as excess of unmetabolised energy in liver cells. Hepatic steatosis is considered reversible and to some extent nonprogressive if the underlying cause is reduced or removed. Severe fatty liver is sometimes accompanied by inflammation, a situation referred to as steatohepatitis. Progression to alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) depends on the persistence or severity of the inciting cause. Pathological lesions in both conditions are similar. However, the extent of inflammatory response varies widely and does not always correlate with degree of fat accumulation. Steatosis (retention of lipid) and onset of steatohepatitis may represent successive stages in FLD progression.",

EFAs are important to have in the diet in adequate amounts, especially for the cat, as since they are essential (meaning the body produces little to none so it must be included in the diet) and cats have very low activity or simply lack the digestive enzymes to generate the EFAs that are important in mediating the inflammatory response. EFAs also vary in size, have many different functions and can also be further divided into other categories, two of which are very important for GI health: the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids (the omega in the name denotes the position of the first double bond in a fatty acid counting from the methyl end). These fatty acids are most effective when present in adequate and appropriate balanced ratios dependent upon stage of life and production of the animal. One very important function of EFAs is the production of eicosanoids (molecules that are important in immune and inflammatory regulation).  Eicosanoids are like hormones and act in a local fashion with short lives.  Different EFAs have different effects on the inflammatory response.  Omega-6 fatty acids at high levels can suppress the functions of the immune system (large part of which is located in the GIT) and promote inflammation, platelet aggregation and hypersensitive reactions like allergies.  Omega-3 fatty acids act in the opposite direction of omega-6 fatty acids by: promoting anti-inflammation and depressing aggregation and immunosuppression.  Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids can be changed using diet, optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is considered to be within the range of 5:1 to 10:1.  The right ratio (different for everyone as everyone is unique) helps reduce inflammation and mediate immune responses as both omega fatty acids utilize the same enzymes in their metabolic journey.

Fatty acid metabolism consists of catabolic processes that generate energy, and anabolic processes that create biologically important molecules (triglycerides, phospholipids, second messengers, local hormones and ketone bodies). Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class. One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production, captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When compared to other macronutrient classes (carbohydrates and protein), fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis, when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids (mainly in the form of triglycerides) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals, and to a lesser extent in plants. In addition, fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed (the cell wall, and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells, such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus). Fatty acids can also be cleaved, or partially cleaved, from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell, and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell.

This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs. Dengue is spread by several species of mosquito of the \"Aedes\" type, principally \"A. aegypti\". The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA. A vaccine for dengue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is recommended instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for fever reduction and pain relief in dengue due to an increased risk of bleeding from NSAID use.

Vaccination against only one serotype could possibly lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic shock (DHS) when infected with another serotype due to antibody-dependent enhancement. When infected with dengue virus, the immune system produces cross-reactive antibodies that provide immunity to that particular serotype. However, these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing other serotypes upon reinfection and actually increase viral replication. When macrophages consume the \u2018neutralized\u2019 virus, the virus is able to replicate within the macrophage, causing disease. These cross-reactive, ineffective antibodies ease access of virus into macrophages, which induces more severe disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome). A common problem faced in dengue-endemic regions is when mothers become infected with dengue; after giving birth, offspring carry the immunity from their mother and are susceptible to hemorrhagic fever if infected with any of the other three serotypes.

Continually advancing informatics tools allow for the identification, quantification and classification of metabolites to determine which pathways may influence certain pharmaceutical interventions. One of the earliest studies discussing the principle and applications of pharmacometabolomics was conducted in an animal model to look at the metabolism of paracetamol and liver damage. NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze the urinary metabolic profiles of rats pre- and post-treatment with paracetamol. The analysis revealed a certain metabolic profile associated with increased liver damage following paracetamol treatment. At this point, it was eagerly anticipated that such pharmacometabolomics approaches could be applied to personalized human medicine. Since this publication in 2006, the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network led by Duke University researchers and that included partnerships between centers of excellence in metabolomics, pharmacogenomics and informatics (over sixteen academic centers funded by NIGMS) has been able to illustrate for the first time the power of the pharmacometabolomics approach in informing about treatment outcomes in large clinical studies and with use of drugs that include antidepressants, statins, antihypertensives, antiplatelet therapies and antipsychotics. Totally new concepts emerged from these studies on use of pharmacometabolomics as a tool that can bring a paradigm shift in the field of pharmacology. It illustrated how pharmacometabolomics can enable a Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology approach.  Pharmacometabolomics has been applied for the treatment of numerous human diseases, such as schizophrenia, diabetes, neural disease, depression and cancer.",

The difference between the two terms is not related to choice of analytical platform: although metabonomics is more associated with NMR spectroscopy and metabolomics with mass spectrometry-based techniques, this is simply because of usages amongst different groups that have popularized the different terms. While there is still no absolute agreement, there is a growing consensus that 'metabolomics' places a greater emphasis on metabolic profiling at a cellular or organ level and is primarily concerned with normal endogenous metabolism. 'Metabonomics' extends metabolic profiling to include information about perturbations of metabolism caused by environmental factors (including diet and toxins), disease processes, and the involvement of extragenomic influences, such as gut microflora. This is not a trivial difference; metabolomic studies should, by definition, exclude metabolic contributions from extragenomic sources, because these are external to the system being studied. However, in practice, within the field of human disease research there is still a large degree of overlap in the way both terms are used, and they are often in effect synonymous.",

This provides detailed mapping of drug effects on metabolism and the pathways that are implicated in mechanism of variation of response to treatment. In addition, the metabolic profile of an individual at baseline (metabotype) provides information about how individuals respond to treatment and highlights heterogeneity within a disease state. All three approaches require the quantification of metabolites found in bodily fluids and tissue, such as blood or urine, and can be used in the assessment of pharmaceutical treatment options for numerous disease states.",

Pharmacometabolomics may be used in a predictive manner to determine the correct course of action in regards to a patient about to undergo some type of drug treatment.

Analysis of a patient\u2019s metabolic profile can reveal factors that may contribute to altered drug metabolism, allowing for predictions of the overall efficacy of a proposed treatment, as well as potential drug toxicity risks that may differ from the general population. This approach has been used to identify novel or previously characterized metabolic biomarkers in patients, which can be used to predict the expected outcome of that patient following treatment with a pharmaceutical compound. One example of the clinical application of pharmacometabolomics are studies that looked to identify a predictive metabolic marker for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD)., In a study with antidepressant Sertraline, the Pharmacometabolomics Network illustrated that metabolic profile at baseline of patients with major depression can inform about treatment outcomes. In addition the study illustrated the power of metabolomics for defining response to placebo and compared response to placebo to response to sertraline and showed that several pathways were common to both. In another study with escitalopram citalopram, metabolomic analysis of plasma from patients with MDD revealed that variations in glycine metabolism were negatively associated with patient outcome upon treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), an important drug class involved in the treatment of this disease.",

In other words, there is both an endogenous metabolome and an exogenous metabolome. The endogenous metabolome can be further subdivided to include a \"primary\" and a \"secondary\" metabolome (particularly when referring to plant or microbial metabolomes). A primary metabolite is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important ecological function. Secondary metabolites may include pigments, antibiotics or waste products derived from partially metabolized xenobiotics. To qualify as a metabolite, or to be considered to be part of the metabolome, a small molecule must typically have a molecular weight <1500 Da. This means that molecules such as glycolipids, polysaccharides, short peptides (<14 amino acids) and small oligonucleotides (<5 bases) can be regarded as metabolites or constituents of the metabolome. On the other hand, very large macromolecules such as proteins, messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, microRNA and DNA are definitely not metabolites and are not considered to be part of the metabolome.

The primary vector, \"Aedes aegypti\", had spread globally from the 15th to the 19th centuries as a result of globalization and the slave trade. This geographic spreading caused dengue fever epidemics throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, and later, in 1906, transmission by the \"Aedes\" mosquitoes was confirmed, making yellow fever and dengue fever the first two diseases known to be caused by viruses. Thomas Milton Rivers published the first clear description of a virus as distinct from a bacterium in 1927. The discovery of the West Nile virus came in 1937, and has since been found in \"Culex\" populations causing epidemics throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. In 1999, the virus was introduced into the Western Hemisphere, sparking a series of epidemics. During the latter half of the 20th century, Dengue fever reemerged as a global disease, with the virus spreading geographically due to urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming, and continues to cause at least 50 million infections per year, making Dengue fever the most common and clinically important arboviral disease.",
