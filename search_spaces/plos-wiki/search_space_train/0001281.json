Complement is responsible for immune inflammatory response in adipose tissues which has been implicated in the development of obesity. Obesity in turn results in an abnormally high level of complement activation via production of the c1 component of the classical pathway, which can lead to tissue inflammation and eventually insulin resistance, however the exact mechanisms that causes this is yet unknown.",

Two main protective mechanisms elicited by cancer immunoprevention in various mouse models were cytokines released by T cells, in particular gamma-interferon, and cytotoxic antibodies against the target antigen. This is at variance with cancer immunotherapy administered to cure existing tumors, which is mainly based on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The lack of a relevant CTL response in long-term immunoprevention is thought to be an advantage, because chronic CTL activation is severely toxic for the host. In contrast circulating antibodies provide long-term protection without toxic side effects. A similar situation happens in viral immunity, acute infections are resolved by CTL, whereas long term immunity from reinfection is provided by antibodies. Both gamma-interferon and antibodies prevent tumor growth in multiple ways. Gamma-interferon activates T, natural killer and B cells, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor invasiveness, stimulates major histocompatibility complex expression in tumor cells and inhibits cell proliferation. Antibodies binding to antigens on the surface of cells trigger lytic mechanisms mediated by the complement system (complement-mediated cytotoxicity) or by leukocytes carrying Fc receptors (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). Moreover, antibody binding interferes with the cellular functions of the target antigen, causing its internalization or hampering molecular interactions, eventually blocking downstream signaling. If the target antigen controls cell growth (e.g. if it is the product of an oncogene), then a block of signaling can disrupt the carcinogenic process. Surface antigens causally involved in carcinogenesis are called oncoantigens.",

The C4 is cleaved by the protease into two parts, a peptide C4a (small at ~9 kDa, and anaphylotoxic), and the higher molecular weight protein C4b, at about 190 kDa. The cleavage of the C4 results in C4b bearing a thioester functional group [-S-C(O)-]: work in the 1980s on C3, and then on C4, indicated the presence, within the parent C3 and C4 structures, of a unique protein modification, a 15-atom (15-membered) thionolactone ring serving to connect the thiol side chain of the amino acid cysteine (Cys) in a -Cys-Gly-Glu-Glx- sequence with a side chain acyl group of what began as a glutamine side chain (Glx, here) that resided three amino acid residues downstream (where the remaining atoms of the 15 were backbone and side chain atoms); upon cleavage, this unique thionolactone ring structure becomes exposed at the surface of the new C4b protein. Because of proximity to the microbial surface, some portion of the released C4b proteins, with this reactive thionolactone, react with nucelophilic amino acid side chains and other groups on the foreign microbe's cell surface, resulting in covalent attachment of the slightly modified C4b protein to the cell surface, via the original Glx residue of C4.",

Factor H binding protein (fHbp) that is exhibited in \"N. meningitidis\" and some commensal species is the main inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway. fHbp protects meningococci from complement-mediated death in human serum experiments, but has also been shown to protect meningococci from antimicrobial peptides \"in vitro\". Factor H binding protein is key to the pathogenesis of \"N. meningitidis\", and is, therefore, important as a potential vaccine candidate. Porins are also an important factor for complement inhibition for both pathogenic and commensal species. Porins are important for nutrient acquisition. Porins are also recognized by TLR2, they bind complement factors (C3b, C4b, factor H, and C4bp (complement factor 4b-binding protein)). Cooperation with pili for CR3-mediated internalization is another function of porins. Ability to translocate into host cells and modulate reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis is made possible by porins, as well. Strains of the same species can express different porins.",

The two main proposed types of EGF-like domains are the human EGF-like (hEGF) domain and the complement C1r-like (cEGF) domain, which was first identified in the human complement protease C1r. C1r is a highly specific serine protease initiating the classical pathway of complement activation during immune response. Both the hEGF- and cEGF-like domains contain three disulfides and derive from a common ancestor that carried four disulfides of which one was lost during evolution. Furthermore, cEGF-like domains can be divided in two subtypes (1 and 2) whereas all hEGF-like domains belong to one subtype.",

The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events.
