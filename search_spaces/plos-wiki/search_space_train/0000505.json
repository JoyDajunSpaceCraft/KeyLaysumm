Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. During pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly through the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies\u2014it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum. Long-term \"active\" memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity can also be generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.",

Reverse vaccinology uses genomic sequences of viral, bacterial, or parasitic pathogens to identify genes potentially encoding genes that promote pathogenesis. The first application of reverse vaccinology identified vaccine candidates against \"Neisseria meningitidis\" serogroup B. Computational tools identified 600 putative surface-exposed or secreted proteins from the complete genome sequence of a MenB pathogenic strain, on the basis of sequence features. These putative proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and used to immunize mice. Tests using mice immune sera estimated the ability of antibodies to protect against these proteins. The proteins able to solicit a robust immune response were checked for sequence conservation across a panel of meningitides strains and allowed for further selection of antigen able to elicit an immune response against most strains in the panel. On the basis of these antigen sequences, scientists have been able to develop a universal \u201ccocktail\u201d vaccine against \"Neisseria meninitidis\" that uses five antigens to promote immunity. Similar approaches have been used for a variety of other human pathogens, such as \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\", \"Chlamydia pneumoniae\", \"Bacillus anthracis\", \"Porphyromonas gingivalis\", \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\", \"Helicobacter pylori\", amongst others.

Recent studies show the crucial role of proliferating, activated effector memory Th1 CD4+ T cells in effective antitumor immunity and reveal that CD4+ T cells induce more durable immune-mediated tumor control than CD8+ T cells. Given that CD4+ T cells are known to play such a central role in regulating virtually all antigen-specific immune responses, they are still not paid much attention to playing a role in immune responses to tumor antigens. The preferred attention to antitumor responses by CD8+ T cells stems from two facts: first, most tumors are positive for MHC class one but negative for MHC class two; and second, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are able to induce tumor killing upon direct recognition of peptide antigens, presented by the tumor\u2019s MHC class one molecules. This preference has been bolstered by numerous adoptive transfer studies in which CD8+ T cell lines and CD8+ clones specific for tumor antigens\u2014that have been stimulated in \"vitro\"\u2014can mediate antitumor immunity when transferred back into tumor-bearing hosts; furthermore, recent reports suggest that immunization\u2014using either adjuvant or dendritic cells with pure tumor peptides\u2014can result in productive antitumor immunity that is restricted by MHC class one. Finally, elimination of CD8+ T cells from mice\u2014at least partially abrogates antitumor immunity induced by most cancer vaccines. Similarly, a critical role for CD4+ T cells in induced antitumor immunity has been consistently demonstrated in vaccine/challenge experiments employing antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ T cells or using CD4-knockout mice. Abrogation of antitumor immunity in CD4-knockout mice or mice depleted of CD4+ T cells has been demonstrated in cases of cell-based vaccines, recombinant viral vaccines and recombinant bacterial vaccines. While most adoptive transfer experiments have been performed with tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, activated CD4+ T cell clones specific for the murine leukemias have been demonstrated to confer systemic antitumor immunity upon transfer into tumor-bearing hosts.",

The capsular polysaccharides of \"Neisseria meningitidis\" are attractive vaccine candidates because they constitute the most highly conserved and most exposed bacterial-surface antigens. The use of capsular polysaccharides as immunoprophylactic agents against human disease caused by encapsulated bacteria is now firmly established. The capsular polysaccharides of the meningococcus are negatively charged and are obtained in a high molecular weight immunogenic form by precipitation. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines are efficacious to protect from meningitis disease in adults, but cannot provide full protection to infants under the age of 5. The duration of protection elicited by the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines is not long lasting in adults and children above four years of age. For children from one to four years old the duration of protection is less than three years. Protective immunity to encapsulated bacterial pathogens such as \"N. meningitidis\" is principally mediated by the reaction between antibody and capsular polysaccharide epitopes. In encapsulated gram negative bacteria, protection results primarily from a direct complement-mediated bactericidal effect. Vaccines have been prepared from the capsular polysaccharides of \"Neisseria meningitidis\" (groups A, C, W-135, and Y). These and other polysaccharides have been classified as T cell independent type 2 (TI-2) antigens based on their inability to stimulate an immune response in animals that carry an X-linked immune B-cell defect (xid). TI-2 antigens tend to be characterized by high molecular weight, multiple repeat epitopes, slow degradation in vivo, and a failure to stimulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) type II mediated T-cell help. TI-2 antigens generally are incapable of stimulating an immune response in neonatal humans under 18 months of age. This has spurred attempts to modify the capsular polysaccharides such that vaccines protective for all at-risk groups will result. To date, the most successful approach has been to covalently bind carrier proteins to the polysaccharides, thus engendering a vaccine capable of invoking a T-dependent response.",

In the past two decades a large initiative has been put forth to understand the biological and pathogenic properties of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1); this has ultimately led to the development of various experimental vaccination and therapeutic strategies to combat HTLV-1 infection. These strategies include the development of envelope glycoprotein derived B-cell epitopes for the induction of neutralizing antibodies, as well as a strategy to generate a multivalent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the HTLV-1 Tax antigen. A vaccine candidate that can elicit or boost anti-gp46 neutralizing antibody response may have a potential for prevention and therapy against HTLV-1 infection.",

            "document": "Intrastructural help . One of the approaches for a protective HIV-1 vaccine is broadly neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies are found in 10-25 % of HIV-1 infected patients. Few of those (worldwide 0.8% of HIV-1 positive individuals) are able to suppress viremia up to a level that is below the detection levels and are so-called \"elite controllers\" or \"long term non-progressors\". Most of the conducted vaccine trials were unable to induce protective neutralizing antibodies; even though some protective effects of poly-functional antibodies were observed. These Fc-dependent effects seem to play an important role in disease control as shown by the non-human primate (NHP) experiment. In contrast, the results of the adenoviral-based STEP trial suggested a higher susceptibility due to high levels of non-neutralizing poly-functional antibodies and helper T cell proliferation induced by vaccination. In mouse models antibodies from the IgG1 subclass, which were mostly induced by vaccination, were seen to possess a relatively low functionality. Therefore, one objective is to increase the quality of the immune response by the induction of poly-functional antibody sub classes, e.g. IgG2A. However, according to results from animal studies, cytotoxic T cells seem to be mandatory for a protective vaccine. Although this was not detectable in the human trials conducted to-date, it is assumed that reduction of viral loads early after infection can be achieved. Thus the current goal is to avoid uncontrolled T cell proliferation and modulate the humoral immune response towards highly efficient poly-functional monoclonal antibodies.",

The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet. Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish. Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure. Cholera is caused by a number of types of \"Vibrio cholerae\", with some types producing more severe disease than others. It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria. Undercooked seafood is a common source. Humans are the only animal affected. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. There are concerns that rising sea levels will increase rates of disease. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test. A rapid dipstick test is available but is not as accurate. Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. They have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by \"E.\u00a0coli\". The primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy\u2014the replacement of fluids with slightly sweet and salty solutions. Rice-based solutions are preferred. Zinc supplementation is useful in children. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.

One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets \"Vibrio cholerae\" serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a \"V. cholera\" PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in \"Yersinia pestis\". Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.",

DOMI Cholera operated from five study sites: Matlab, Bangladesh; North Jakarta, Indonesia; Kolkata, India; Beira, Mozambique; and Hue, Vietnam. From these sites, IVI conducted disease burden, economic, and socio-behavioral studies and cholera vaccination campaigns. The studies found a high demand for cholera vaccine and high incidence rates (3-9/1,000) in children 5 years old and younger. IVI\u2019s vaccination campaign in Beira saw more than 44,000 children and adults receive the internationally-licensed Dukoral vaccine. In Kolkata, IVI vaccinated more than 67,000 children and adults using an oral cholera vaccine produced by Vietnam\u2019s VaBiotech. At the onset of DOMI Cholera, the only internationally licensed cholera vaccine available was Dukoral, but at $90 for the two-dose series, this vaccine was too expensive for public use in many of the poorest developing countries. VaBiotech\u2019s cholera vaccine, originally developed by Vietnam\u2019s National Institute of Health and Epidemiology following a technology transfer from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, was not licensed for international use but showed great promise as a low-cost vaccine for the developing world. As a result, the Gates Foundation provided IVI with additional funding to establish the Cholera Vaccine Initiative (CVI) with the goal of reformulating the VaBiotech vaccine for international use.",

The vibrios were found in the guts of six pilgrims returning from Mecca. Though the pilgrims failed to show ante or post mortem evidence of cholera, the vibrios isolated from the guts were agglutinable within the anti-cholera serum.  Later in 1905, Kraus and Pribram found that the bacteria, which produced soluble hemolysin, were more related to non-cholera vibrios; therefore, referred to all hemolytic vibrios as El Tor vibrios. In the early 1930s, A. Shousha, A. Gardner and K. Venkatraman, all researchers, suggested that only hemolytic vibrios agglutinated with anti-cholera serum should be referred to as El Tor vibrios. In 1959, R. Pollitzer designated El Tor as its own species \"V. eltor\" separate from \"V. cholera\", but six years later, in 1965, R. Hugh discovered that \"V. cholerae\" and \"V. eltor\" were similar in 30 positive and 20 negative characteristics. Thus, they were classified as a single species \"V. cholera\": however, Hugh believed the differing features between the two could be of epidemiological importance, so El Tor vibrios were further classified as \"V. cholerae\" biotype eltor (serogroup O1).",

El Tor is able to survive in the body longer than classical cholera vibrios. This characteristic allows carriers to infect a greater population of people. In fact, \"V. cholerae\" biotype eltor can be isolated from water sources in the absence of an outbreak of cases. In extreme cases, persons can become long-term carriers; for example, Cholera Dolores, who tested vibrio positive nine years after her primary infection. El Tor is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. This route is the consequence of infected persons defecating near a water source, and uninfected persons consuming contaminated water. In addition, the bacteria can be transmitted by consuming uncooked food fertilized with human feces. Treatment of a cholera infection consists of replenishing lost fluid and electrolytes by intravenous or oral solutions, and by antibiotics. El Tor outbreaks can be prevented by better standards of sanitation, filtering and boiling water, thoroughly cooking seafood, and washing vegetables and fruits before consumption.",

Cholera is a diarrheal disease that is caused by the bacterium \"Vibrio cholerae.\" \"V. cholerae\" has been a popular bacterium for phylodynamic analysis after the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti. The cholera outbreak happened right after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which caused critical infrastructure damage, leading to the conclusion that the outbreak was most likely due to the \"V. cholerae\" bacterium being introduced naturally to the waters in Haiti from the earthquake. Soon after the earthquake, the UN sent MINUSTAH troops from Nepal to Haiti. Rumors started circulating about terrible conditions of the MINUSTAH camp, as well as people claiming that the MINUSTAH troops were deposing of their waste in the Artibonite River, which is the major water source in the surrounding area. Soon after the MINUSTAH troops arrival, the first cholera case was reported near the location of the MINUSTAH camp. Phylodynamic analysis was used to look into the source of the Haiti cholera outbreak. Whole genome sequencing of \"V. cholerae\" revealed that there was one single point source of the cholera outbreak in Haiti and it was similar to O1 strains circulating in South Asia. Before the MINUSTAH troops from Nepal were sent to Haiti, a cholera outbreak had just occurred in Nepal. In the original research to trace the origin of the outbreak, the Nepal strains were not available. Phylodynamic analyses were performed on the Haitian strain and the Nepalese strain when it became available and affirmed that the Haitian cholera strain was the most similar to the Nepalese cholera strain. This outbreak strain of cholera in Haiti showed signs of an altered or hybrid strain of \"V. cholerae\" associated with high virulence. Typically high quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (hqSNP) from whole genome \"V. cholerae\" sequences are used for phylodynamic analysis. Using phylodynamic analysis to study cholera helps prediction and understanding of \"V. cholerae\" evolution during bacterial epidemics.",

A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of \"Vibrio cholerae\" specimens. Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be \"Cholera-affected\"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health. These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts. Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.",
