It is a specialized field of study in virology. Pathogenesis is a process in which an initial infection becomes a disease. Viral disease is the sum of the effects on the host caused by the replication of the virus and of the host's subsequent immune response. Viruses are able to initiate infection, disperse throughout the body, and replicate due to virulence characteristics. Mechanisms of pathogenesis of viral diseases include: implantation of the virus at the portal of entry, local replication, spread to target organs, and shedding of the virus into the environment. There are several factors that affect pathogenic mechanisms. Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must overpower several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers, host defenses, and conflicting cellular susceptibilities. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals and different races due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.",

GBS colonization usually does not cause problems in healthy women, nevertheless during pregnancy it can sometimes cause serious illness for the mother and the newborn. GBS is the leading cause of bacterial neonatal infection in the baby during gestation and after delivery with significant mortality rates in premature infants. GBS infections in the mother can cause chorioamnionitis (a severe infection of the placental tissues) infrequently and postpartum infections (after birth). GBS urinary tract infections (UTI) may induce labor and cause premature delivery. In the western world, GBS (in the absence of effective prevention measures) is the major cause of several bacterial infections of the newborn neonatal infection septicemia, pneumonia, and meningitis, which can lead to death or long-term sequelae. GBS neonatal infection typically originates in the lower reproductive tract of infected mothers.  GBS infections in newborns are separated into two clinical syndromes, early-onset disease (EOD) and late-onset disease (LOD). EOD manifests from 0 to 7 living days in the newborn, most of the cases of EOD being apparent within 24h of birth. The most common clinical syndromes of EOD are sepsis without apparent focus, pneumonia, and less frequently meningitis. EOD is acquired vertically (vertical transmission), through exposure of the fetus or the baby to GBS from the vagina of a colonized woman, either intrautero or during birth after rupture of membranes. Infants can be infected during passage through the birth canal, nevertheless newborns that acquire GBS through this route can become only colonized, and these colonized infants habitually do not develop EOD. Roughly 50% of newborns to GBS colonized mothers are also GBS colonized and (without prevention measures) 1\u20132% of these newborns will develop EOD. In the past, the incidence of EOD ranged from 0.7 to 3.7 per thousand live births in the US and from 0.2 to 3.25 per thousand in Europe. In 2008, after widespread use of antenatal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), the CDC reported an incidence of 0.28 cases of EOD per thousand live births in the US.

Symptoms of bacterial panicle blight include seedling blighting and sheath rot in addition to panicle blighting, which accounts for most of the damage from this disease. Affected panicles have blighted florets, which initially show white or light gray on the basal third with a dark-brown margin and eventually become straw-colored. The florets then turn dark with growth of fungi or bacteria on the surface. Extensive occurrence of upright panicles because of the failure of grain-filling and seed development is a typical phenomenon observed in a severely infested field. Prolonged high temperature during the growing season is an important environmental condition that promotes the development of bacterial panicle blight.  Severe epidemics of this disease, which caused up to 40 percent yield losses in some fields, occurred during the 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000 and, most recently, 2010 growing seasons, when record-high night temperatures were experienced. Suspected global warming could make bacterial panicle blight a greater threat to rice production in the future. Indeed, occurrence of bacterial panicle blight is increasing not only in the southern United States but in other rice growing countries of Central and South America and Asia. <br>The disease cycle of bacterial panicle blight is not fully understood in spite of the economic importance of the disease. <br>The bacterial pathogens are considered to be seed-borne, but they also survive in the soil. After germination of the seed, the bacteria appear to survive on the leaves and sheath and spread upward as the plant grows. Their infection to rice panicles occurs at flowering, if the bacterial population reaches to a threshold level and environmental condition is favorable. They may also be disseminated from severely diseased panicles to neighboring healthy plants, according to the observed spatial distribution patterns of the disease in infested rice fields. However, it is not clear if long-distance dissemination can occur via insect transmission. Unfortunately, there are few effective control measures for this disease so far. Less nitrogen fertilization reduces disease severity but has not been successful. High temperatures at the vulnerable period can be avoided by early planting, but this cultural practice would become useless if hot weather comes early in the growing season. No pesticides are currently recommended or allowed for controlling this disease in the United States. Copper compounds are weakly effective but sometimes toxic to the plant. Oxolinic acid is useful for seed treatment, and its foliar spray is effective on infected plants, but this chemical is not commercially available in the United States. <br>The research goal on bacterial panicle blight is to develop effective disease control methods based on better understanding of the bacterial virulence mechanism and the rice defense system. To achieve this goal, LSU AgCenter scientists are conducting several different areas of research. First, scientists are making efforts to develop new rice varieties and lines resistant to bacterial panicle blight through conventional breeding and line development processes. More than 15,000 lines are evaluated annually to select promising lines showing high levels of disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight and other good agronomic traits. The partial-resistant rice varieties and lines, such as Jupiter and LM-1, were developed from this program. Second, scientists are conducting genetic and molecular biological studies on the rice disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight. Genetic mapping to identify the rice genes associated with the disease resistance is under way. In addition, the induction of a rice defense system by pretreatment of various chemical materials, which leads to enhanced disease resistance, is being studied. Finally, scientists are studying molecular genetics and genomics of the major pathogen, B. glumae, to understand the mechanism underlying its bacterial pathogenesis in rice. Genetic elements governing the production of virulence factors are being identified and characterized.",

Numerous studies have shown that inhibiting a single adhesin in this coordinated effort can often be enough to make a pathogenic bacterium non-virulent. This has led to the exploration of adhesin activity interruption as a method of bacterial infection treatment.",

When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. \"Agrobacterium\" performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA into the plant's genome. See above for more details about the process of plasmid DNA insertion into the host genome. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes this tissue to become crushed and/or distorted. The crushed vessels lead to reduced water flow in the xylem. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant. Crown gall disease caused by \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" can be controlled by using various different methods. The best way to control this disease is to take preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools so as to avoid infecting new plants. Performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields are also valuable practices. Avoiding wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation is important for preventing disease. In horticultural techniques in which multiple plants are joined together to grow as one, such as budding and grafting these techniques lead to plant wounds. Wounds are the primary location of bacterial entry into the host plant. Therefore, it is advisable to perform these techniques during times of the year when \"Agrobacteria\" are not active. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection, since these insects cause wounds (aka bacterial entryways) in the plant roots. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.",

These traits include the ability to reproduce sooner, reproduce faster, reproduce in higher numbers, live longer, survive against antibodies, or survive in parts of the body the pathogen does not normally infiltrate. These traits typically arise due to mutations, which occur more frequently in pathogen populations than in host populations, due to the pathogens' rapid generation time and immense numbers. After only a few generations, the mutations that enhance rapid reproduction or dispersal will increase in frequency. The same mutations that enhance the reproduction and dispersal of the pathogen also enhance its virulence in the host, causing much harm (disease and death). If the pathogen's virulence kills the host and interferes with its own transmission to a new host, virulence will be selected against. But as long as transmission continues despite the virulence, virulent pathogens will have the advantage. So, for example, virulence often increases within families, where transmission from one host to the next is likely, no matter how sick the host. Similarly, in crowded conditions such as refugee camps, virulence tends to increase over time since new hosts cannot escape the likelihood of infection.",

Viruses are parasitic in nature and cannot proliferate on their own. Therefore, they must infect another organism and effectively hijack cellular machinery to complete their life cycle. The first stage of the viral life cycle is called viral entry. This defines the manner in which a virus infects a new host cell. In nature, neurotropic viruses are usually transmitted through bites or scratches, as in the case of Rabies virus or certain strains of Herpesviruses. In tracing studies, this step occurs artificially, typically through the use of a syringe. The next stage of the viral life cycle is called viral replication. During this stage, the virus takes over the host cell's machinery to cause the cell to create more viral proteins and assemble more viruses. Once the cell has produced a sufficient number of viruses, the virus enters the viral shedding stage. During this stage, viruses leave the original host cell in search of a new host. In the case of neurotropic viruses, this transmission typically occurs at the synapse. Viruses can jump across the relatively short space from one neuron to the next. This trait is what makes viruses so useful in tracer studies. Once the virus enters the next cell, the cycle begins anew. The original host cell begins to degrade after the shedding stage. In tracer studies, this is the reason the timing must be tightly controlled. If the virus is allowed to spread too far, the original microcircuitry of interest is degraded and no useful information can be retrieved. Typically, viruses can infect only a small number of organisms, and even then only a specific cell type within the body. The specificity of a particular virus for a specific tissue is known as its tropism. Viruses in tracer studies are all neurotropic (capable of infecting neurons).",

The most common vertebrate affected by BATV are domestic pigs, horses, ruminants and wild birds, which have been known to be the primary mammalian hosts. The transmission cycle of BATV occurs in agricultural ecosystems via Anopheles, Culex and Ochlerotatus species mosquitoes in a typical vertebrate\u2013mosquito cycle.  While limited research has been conducted on the viral cycle of the Batai virus, comparable studies with the close relative Bunyamwera virus has shown that viral infection begins in the salivary glands of mosquitos. At the onset of replication the virus particles coalesce into vacuole membranes lining the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Entry into the cell is facilitated by the viral enveloped nucleocapsid, which contains glycoproteins G1 and G2. Encoded by the M RNA segment they are involved in attachment to the host cell through unidentified receptors on the surface and elicit neutralizing antibodies. Transcription of BATV is said to be similar to that of influenza in that mRNA synthesis is primed by cap-containing oligonucleotides that are generated by a certain viral-endonuclease, functioning to cleave the host cell mRNA. These resulting primers are then incorporated into the viral mRNA. BATV will also encode for two non-structural proteins, NSm on the M segment and NSs on the S segment. During the process it is believed that NSm actively participates in assembly of the virus. These newly assembled viral particles will mature over a period of time inside of the hosts cell in the membranes of the Golgi apparatus before being released. However, while able to replicate in both vertebrate and invertebrate species, in mosquito cells no cell death is observed and persistent infection is established. Whereas in mammalian cells infection is typically categorized as lytic and eventually leads to cell death. This stems from the viruses ability to form clear lytic plaques in cells of vertebrate species but not in those derived from insects. It has been demonstrated in previous studies that in mammalian cells, the NSs protein will induce a shut-off of host protein synthesis which will lead to the death of the host cell. It has also been shown to counteract the host cell antiviral response. This would establish it as the main virulence factor as it acts during the transcriptional phase by inhibiting RNA polymerase II\u2013mediated transcription. Meanwhile, the mosquito cells neither host cell transcription nor translation are inhibited by this fact. It would seem the difference in the behavior of the NSs protein could be one of the factors responsible for the different outcomes of infection attributed to the Batai virus in mammalian and mosquito cells. Some have theorized that a release method that does not rupture the cell membrane could explain why viral replication does not kill mosquito cells and persistence is maintained. Similar NSs proteins of the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus have quite a distinct size and amino acid sequence, but they play a similar role in mammalian cells in overcoming the innate immune responses that are a consequence of the global shut-down of the cells transcription mechanisms.

Their genome reduction occurs by different evolutionary mechanisms than those of streamlined free-living organisms. Pathogenic organisms are thought to undergo genome reduction due to genetic drift, rather than purifying selection. Genetic drift is caused by small and effective populations within a microbial community, rather than large and dominating populations. In this case, DNA mutations happen by chance, and thus often lead to maladaptive genome degradation and lower overall fitness. Rather than loosing non-coding DNA regions or extraneous genes to increase fitness during replication, they loose certain \"core\" metabolic genes that may now be supplemented by their host, symbiont, or environment. Since their genome reduction is less dependent on fitness, pseudogenes are frequent in these organisms. They also typically undergo low rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Viral genomes resemble prokaryotic genomes in that they have very few non-coding regions. They are, however, significantly smaller than prokaryotic genomes. While viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, viral genomes are considered streamlined due to the strong purifying selection that occurs when the virus has successfully infected a host.

Simulation-based models may be compartmental, tracking the numbers of hosts infected and recovered to different viral strains, or may be individual-based, tracking the infection state and immune history of every host in the population. Generally, compartmental models offer significant advantages in terms of speed and memory usage, but may be difficult to implement for complex evolutionary or epidemiological scenarios. A forward simulation model may account for geographic population structure or age structure by modulating transmission rates between host individuals of different geographic or age classes. Additionally, seasonality may be incorporated by allowing time of year to influence transmission rate in a stepwise or sinusoidal fashion.",

It has also been suggested that rhinorrhea is a result of viral evolution, and may be a response that is not useful to the host, but which has evolved by the virus to maximise its own infectivity. Rhinorrhea caused by these infections usually occur on circadian rhythms. Over the course of a viral infection, sinusitis (the inflammation of the nasal tissue) may occur, causing the mucous membranes to release more mucus.

Cryo-electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction of the viral capsid shows that there is a long 'spike' structure which first contacts the cell wall and likely serves to puncture the cell wall of the host. The PBCV-1 virus is specific to its host and recognition is mediated by the interaction of virus surface proteins with algal surface carbohydrates. Following attachment of the virus to the host's cell wall, capsid-bound glycolytic enzymes break down the cell wall. The viral membrane likely fuses with the host membrane, allowing the viral DNA to enter the cytoplasm, leaving an empty capsid on the outside. As PBCV-1 lacks an RNA polymerase gene, the virus must use the host cell's machinery to produce viral RNA. Thus, the viral DNA quickly moves to the nucleus where early transcription is initiated 5\u201310 minutes post infection. Within minutes of infection, host chromosomal degradation occurs, inhibiting host transcription. At 20 minutes post infection, most of the mRNAs in the infected cell are viral mRNAs. The proteins translated from the early stage of transcription are involved in initiating viral DNA replication, occurring 60\u201390 minutes post infection. The second phase of proteins are translated in the cytoplasm and the assembly of virus capsids begins about 2\u20133 hours post infection. Mature virions are formed with the addition of newly-replicated viral DNA from the host nucleus, likely facilitated by a virus encoded DNA packaging ATPase. About 5\u20136 hours following PBCV-1 infection, the cytoplasm is filled with virions and lysis occurs at 6\u20138 hours post infection releasing roughly 1000 particles per cell.",

Recent studies employed an ex vivo human lymphoid aggregate culture (HLAC) system formed with fresh human tonsil or spleen tissue to model molecular and cellular events in human tissues during in vivo HIV infection. These studies found that >95% of CD4 T cells die because of abortive HIV infection. These dying cells are resting and thus are nonpermissive for productive HIV infection. Full viral replication was limited to the \u223c5% of activated CD4 T cells present in these tissues; these cells die by apoptosis. Abortive HIV infection occurs due to slowing of reverse transcription promoting cytosolic DNA accumulation. This viral DNA is sensed by gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), which produces an innate immune response against the virus by activating caspase 1 in IFI16 inflammasomes and inducing pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death. These findings cast CD4 T-cell death during HIV infection in a different light. Rather than the virus playing a major role, it is the host response to viral DNA produced during abortive infection that triggers CD4 T-cell death. Further, these findings identify novel drug targets that may be exploited to both block CD4 T cell demise and the chronic inflammatory response generated during pyroptosis.",

HTLV-1 is an abbreviation for \"human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1\", also called human T-cell leukemia type 1, a virus that has been implicated in several kinds of diseases, including HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, and as a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).HTLV-1 has six reported subtypes (subtypes A to F). The great majority of infections are caused by the cosmopolitan subtype A. HTLV was discovered by Robert Gallo and colleagues in 1980. Between 1 in 20 and 1 in 25 infected people are thought to develop cancer as a result of the virus. HTLV-1 infection is thought to spread only through dividing cells since reverse transcriptase generates proviral DNA from genomic viral RNA, and the provirus is integrated into the host genome by viral integrase after transmission. Therefore, the quantification of provirus reflects the number of HTLV-1-infected cells. So, an increase in numbers of HTLV-1-infected cells using cell division, by actions of accessory viral genes, especially Tax, may provide an enhancement of infectivity Tax expression induces proliferation, inhibits the apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected cells and, conversely, evokes the host immune response, including cytotoxic T cells, to kill virus-infected cells. Interesting, HTLV-1 Tax viral gene is known to dampen innate antiviral signaling pathways to avoid host detection and elimination, through SOCS1 and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Interacting Protein (AIP).",

Studies in cultured human lung epithelial cells infected with the influenza virus H1N1 or H5N1 have found that endogenous production of PD1 decreases dramatically during infection due to the inhibition of 15-LO-1. Furthermore, the same studies have shown that in vivo administration of PD1 to H1N1 infected mice can potentially inhibit both the proliferation of the virus and the inflammation caused by the infection, thus increasing survival. Interestingly, PD1 protects against viral infections by disrupting the virus life cycle. Specifically, PD1 inhibits the binding of viral RNA to specific nuclear export factors in the host cells, thus blocking the export of viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytosol. The nuclear RNA export factor 1(NXF1) is of particular interest in the attenuation of viral infections via the activity of PD1. Specifically, the NXF1 transporter through its middle and C-terminal domains binds to the phenylalanine/glycine repeats in the nucleoporins (Nups) that line the nuclear pore. In the absence of PD1, influenza viral RNA binds to the NXF1 transporter that later binds specifically to Nup62 nucleoporin and exports the viral RNA into the cytosol. However, the administration of PD1 has shown that this lipid mediator specifically inhibits the binding of the viral RNA to NXF1, thus disrupting the proliferation of the virus.",

This work revealed that intranuclear proteins are localized to specific sites to carry out their functions, much as cytoplasmic proteins were known to localize to specific sites. This led to new areas of study of intranuclear compartmentalization of DNA virus replication. Knipe's research has shown that host cell DNA repair and recombination proteins are localized to the viral replication compartments and that some of these inhibit viral replication while some are essential for viral replication. He discovered the molecular basis of herpes simplex virus lytic and latent infection through the definition of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in which: viral proteins promote euchromatin modifications on viral chromation and transcription of lytic genes in epithelial cells; and the viral latency-associated transcript promotes heterochromatin modifications on viral chromatin and silencing of lytic genes in neurons. He defined the structure of viral chromatin during latent infection of neurons and the mechanisms by which viral DNA is kept silenced during latent infection. He has also defined the cellular proteins that recognize herpesviral DNA in the nucleus and initiate innate signaling and restrict viral gene expression and identified viral proteins that block host innate responses. His work has shown that replication-defective viruses can serve as a genital herpes vaccine and as a vaccine vector\u2014one of these genital herpes vaccines, HSV-529, is the leading candidate in phase I clinical trials.",

This activation facilitates the three key stages of the viral life cycle: entry to the cell; reverse transcription and proviral transcription. Chemokine receptors are vital for the entry of HIV into cells. The expression of these receptors is inducible by immune activation caused through infection or immunization, thus augmenting the number of cells that are able to be infected by HIV-1. Both reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome and the rate of transcription of proviral DNA rely upon the activation state of the cell and are less likely to be successful in quiescent cells. In activated cells there is an increase in the cytoplasmic concentrations of mediators required for reverse transcription of the HIV genome. Activated cells also release IFN-alpha which acts on an autocrine and paracrine loop that up-regulates the levels of physiologically active NF-kappa B which activates host cell genes as well as the HIV-1 LTR. The impact of co-infections by micro-organisms such as \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" can be important in disease progression, particularly for those who have a high prevalence of chronic and recurrent acute infections and poor access to medical care. Often, survival depends upon the initial AIDS-defining illness. Co-infection with DNA viruses such as HTLV-1, herpes simplex virus-2, varicella zoster virus and cytomegalovirus may enhance proviral DNA transcription and thus viral load as they may encode proteins that are able to trans-activate the expression of the HIV-1 pro-viral DNA. Frequent exposure to helminth infections, which are endemic in Africa, activates individual immune systems, thereby shifting the cytokine balance away from an initial Th1 cell response against viruses and bacteria which would occur in the uninfected person to a less protective T helper 0/2-type response. HIV-1 also promotes a Th1 to Th0 shift and replicates preferentially in Th2 and Th0 cells. This makes the host more susceptible to and less able to cope with infection with HIV-1, viruses and some types of bacteria. Ironically, exposure to dengue virus seems to slow HIV progression rates temporarily.",
