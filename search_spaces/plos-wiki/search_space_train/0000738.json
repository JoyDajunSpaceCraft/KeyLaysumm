Although the RT structures from human, murine and avian retroviruses display different subunits, the relative sizes, orientation and connection of the DNA polymerase and RNase H domains are strikingly similar. The RNase H domain occupies ~25% of the RT protein C-terminal. The DNA polymerase domain occupies ~55% of the RT protein N-terminal. The RNase H domains of MMLV and HIV-1 RT enzymes are structural very similar to the Escherichia coli and Bacillus halodurans RNases H as well as to human RNaseH1. In general, the folded structures of retroviral RNase H domains take the form of 5-stranded mixed beta sheets flanked by four alpha helices in an asymmetric distribution. A notable difference between the various RNase H proteins is the presence or absence of the C-helix (present in E. coli, MLV and human RNases H, absent in HIV-1, B. halodurans and ASLV RNases H), a positively charged alpha helix also referred to as the basic loop or protrusion. It is believed to have a role in substrate binding. During reverse transcription of the viral genomic RNA into cDNA, an RNA/DNA hybrid is created. The RNA strand is then hydrolyzed by the RNase H domain to enable synthesis of the second DNA strand by the DNA polymerase function of the RT enzyme. In addition, retroviral virions package a single tRNA molecule that they use as a primer during reverse transcription of the viral genomic RNA. The retroviral RNase H is needed to digest the tRNA molecule when it is no longer needed. These processes happen in a Mg2+ dependent fashion.",

These elements are what provide the basis for the RNPs helical conformation. NP/N proteins are also vital for the transcription and replication of full-length RNA templates. The proper function of NP/N proteins rely on their capacity to oligomerize. This defines the ability of NP/N proteins to complex together to form larger structural elements. The oligomerization mechanism is unique between the nonsegmented NSV genome (nsNSV) and segmented NSV genome (sNSV). For nsNSVs, interactions occur between the protein monomers, while the stabilization of this complex occurs through inter-monomeric contact involving N-terminal and/or C-terminal protein extensions. This contributes to the viral RNP helical structure. Oligomerization for sNSVs has been shown to be similar to this for some Bunyaviridae, but it may also take place much more flexibly, defined by their ability to form much smaller oligomers.

These complexes play an integral part in a number of important biological functions that include DNA replication, regulating gene expression and regulating the metabolism of RNA. A few examples of RNPs include the ribosome, the enzyme telomerase, vault ribonucleoproteins, RNase P, hnRNP and small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs), which have been implicated in pre-mRNA splicing (spliceosome) and are among the main components of the nucleolus. Some viruses are simple ribonucleoproteins, containing only one molecule of RNA and a number of identical protein molecules. Others are ribonucleoprotein or deoxyribonucleoprotein complexes containing a number of different proteins, and exceptionally more nucleic acid molecules.Currently, over 2000 RNPs can be found in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Furthermore, the Protein-RNA Interface Data Base (PRIDB) possesses a collection of information on RNA-protein interfaces based on data drawn from the PDB. Some common features of protein-RNA interfaces were deduced based on known structures. For example, RNP in snRNPs have an RNA-binding motif in its RNA-binding protein. Aromatic amino acid residues in this motif result in stacking interactions with RNA. Lysine residues in the helical portion of RNA-binding proteins help to stabilize interactions with nucleic acids. This nucleic acid binding is strengthened by electrostatic attraction between the positive lysine side chains and the negative nucleic acid phosphate backbones. Additionally, it is possible to model RNPs computationally. Although computational methods of deducing RNP structures are less accurate than experimental methods, they provide a rough model of the structure which allows for predictions of the identity of significant amino acids and nucleotide residues. Such information helps in understanding the overall function the RNP.'RNP' can also refer to ribonucleoprotein particles. Ribonucleoprotein particles are distinct intracellular foci for post-transcriptional regulation. These particles play an important role in influenza A virus replication. The influenza viral genome is composed of eight ribonucleoprotein particles formed by a complex of negative-sense RNA bound to a viral nucleoprotein. Each RNP carries with it an RNA polymerase complex. When the nucleoprotein binds to the viral RNA, it is able to expose the nucleotide bases which allow the viral polymerase to transcribe RNA. At this point, once the virus enters a host cell it will be prepared to begin the process of replication.",

At Duke, Bieniasz studied several aspects of the HIV-1 life cycle, including the determinants of specificity in the viral envelope with the cellular receptor CCR5 and HIV-1 Tat interaction with host factors. Bieniasz started his own independent lab in 1999 at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and Rockefeller University in New York. Initially he worked on understanding how later steps of viral infection, such as assembly and budding, were inhibited in rodent cells . This interest in viral budding came to define Bieniasz's career. Bieniasz showed that the retroviral protein Gag assembles at the plasma membrane, recruiting the viral genome by hijacking a specialized cellular protein complex involved in membrane vesicle trafficking, the ESCRT complex. Together with his wife and colleague, Theodora Hatziioannou, they identified several host-specific factors that restrict replication of HIV-1 in macaques. Tetherin, a potent antiviral factor, was also discovered in his lab and shown to be counteracted by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu. Subsequently, another inhibitor of HIV-1 replication was discovered in his lab, Mx2, a cellular protein shown to inhibit post-entry steps of the HIV-1 infection. In recent years, Paul Bieniasz's group has focused on viral RNA interactions with cellular proteins; in particular, his group showed that APOBEC3G is recruited to virions by interaction with the viral RNA, and that CG-depletion of HIV-1 genomes is a mechanism to evade the antiviral, RNA-binding protein ZAP. Bieniasz acted as Chair of the NIH AIDS Molecular and Cellular Biology study section from 2004 to 2009 and served on the NCI Board of Scientific Counselors from 2010 to 2014.",

Alternatively, a frameshift may occur in the Core region to produce an Alternate Reading Frame Protein (ARFP). HCV encodes two proteases, the NS2 cysteine autoprotease and the NS3-4A serine protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes places via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, which produces a negative strand RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template for the production of new positive strand viral genomes.

RNA binding proteins contain domains that have only a few types of amino acids; these domains are termed \"low complexity domains\" and have a strong tendency to aggregate. A highly unusual and important aspect of these proteins is that they use reversible aggregation as normal biological mechanism to sequester RNA transcripts. RNA binding proteins form a variety of cellular aggregates including stress granules, transport granules, P-bodies and nuclear speckles. In 2010 Dr. Wolozin's group was one of the first groups to suggest that dysfunction of the stress granule pathway contributes to the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since then, a growing body of evidence, increasingly highlights the important contributions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), stress granules and translational regulation in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. This work prompted the concept that \u201cregulated protein aggregation\u201d, which provides a theoretical framework for understanding the biology of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The cell controls the location and disposition of RNA through the binding of RNA-binding proteins; these RNA binding proteins consolidate to form RNA granules through reversible aggregation of their low complexity domains. Recently, the biophysics of RNA granule formation has been shown to fall under the aegis of a general property, termed liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS occurs when RNA binding proteins associate to form structures analogous to liquid droplets, which separate from surrounding aqueous medium.",

Mutation of the NC domain in Gag, similarly, halts RNA packaging, but also prevents the assembly of retroviral particles.

However, further research of the NC domain involving recombinant Gag proteins show the encapsidation signal \"is\" necessary for viral particle assembly.

Filovirus RdRps bind to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell determines when the RdRp switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies.

So far, the atomic structures of nucleocapsid-like-particles (NLP) have been elucidated for three NSV families: Rhabdoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Bunyaviridae. One important element of NSVs is that the capsid protein (N) is first synthesized as a monomeric protein (N0). N0 is a capsid protein that assembles a capsid to accommodate any RNA sequence. N0 is kept monomeric in different ways depending on which family of NSVs a virus falls into. For instance, rhabdoviruses keep the N0 monomeric by forming a complex with the phosphoprotein (P). It has been found that both the N- and C terminal regions of P bind to the capsid protein. Essentially, the P binding occupies the site required for N0 oligomerization. Other viruses, such as bunyaviruses, simply sequester the N terminus by N itself. Nonetheless, it is essential for N to be monomeric for the NSV to be competent in encapsidating viral RNA.",

            "document": "Molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of alcoholism . In coordination with the molecules and pathways discussed, epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the development of alcoholism. These mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation, and (microRNA miRNA) action. Methylation of the DNA typically occurs at CpG sites, or a cysteine nucleotide followed by a guanine nucleotide in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction. These sites are common promoter and regulatory elements in mammals and methylation of cysteine residues typically inhibits these functions resulting in the repression of gene expression. DNA methylation is carried out by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are recruited to CpG sites by methyl-DNA binding proteins, such as MeCP2. Next, histones can be modified in several ways to increase or decrease gene expression. Histones are protein complexes used to package DNA into structures known as nucleosomes. The level of coiling of the DNA around histones is variable and influences transcription levels. Tight coiling, or heterochromatin, is associated with low gene expression or even silencing. Loose coiling, or euchromatin, is associated with higher levels of gene expression. Typically, acetylation of histones is associated with euchromatin formation. Acetyl groups are added by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as CBP. In opposition, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups, typically leading to the formation of heterochromatin. HDACs are recruited by scaffolding proteins, such as RACK 1. HDAC inhibitors prevent HDAC functioning which promotes gene expression. Histone methylation, adding a methyl group to specific histone protein amino acids, can both increase or decrease gene expression depending on the histone protein, amino acid, and number of methyl groups used. Gene expression can also be inhibited post-transcriptionally by miRNA, double-stranded RNA, typically formed from hairpin structures, that is used to inhibit translation of proteins. After processing by the RNA interference (RNAi) molecules Drosha and Dicer, a single, guide-strand is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which is used to bind mRNA. This binding suppresses protein synthesis and sometimes initiates mRNA degradation.",

These inhibitors have achieved a significant reduction in HCV RNA blood levels and can therefore be considered as potent antivirals. Their mechanism of action is thought to be diverse but the exact mechanism is not fully understood. Most studies assume that NS5A inhibitors act on two essential stages of the HCV life cycle; the replication of the genomic RNA, and virion assembly. Other studies propose an alteration of host cell factors as a possible third mechanism. The structure of NS5A inhibitors is characterized by dimeric symmetry. This suggests that NS5A inhibitors act on dimers of NS5A. A number of modeling studies have shown that daclatasvir, which is an NS5A inhibitor, only binds to the \"back-to-back\" NS5A dimer and that the binding has to be symmetrical. Other modeling studies have shown that binding to other conformations of NS5A might be possible, as well as asymmetrical binding. Research has shown that daclatasvir's target is most likely domain I of NS5A. Even though the mechanism is not completely understood, it has been demonstrated that the inhibitors downregulate NS5A hyperphosphorylation, leading to the suppression of HCV replication and its processing of polyproteins, as well as resulting in an unusual protein location. Hitherto, this inhibition was thought to require only NS5A domain I, but not domains II and III. However, recent studies have shown that both domains I and II are relevant to this disruption of RNA replication.",

Transcription results in five monocistronic mRNAs being produced because the intergenic sequences act as both termination and promoter sequences for adjacent genes. This type of transcription mechanism is explained by stop-start model( stuttering transcription). Owing to stop-start model, the large amounts of the structural proteins are produced. According to this model, the virus-associated RNA polymerase starts firstly the synthesis of leader RNA and then the five mRNA which will produce N,P,M,G,L proteins, respectively. After the leader RNA was produced, the polymerase enzyme reinitiates virion transcription on N gene and proceeds its synthesis until it ends 3\u2032 end of the chain.Then, the synthesis of P mRNAs are made by same enzyme with new starter sinyal. These steps continue until the enzyme arrives the end of the L gene.

At Duke, Bieniasz studied several aspects of the HIV-1 life cycle, including the determinants of specificity in the viral envelope with the cellular receptor CCR5 and HIV-1 Tat interaction with host factors. Bieniasz started his own independent lab in 1999 at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and Rockefeller University in New York. Initially he worked on understanding how later steps of viral infection, such as assembly and budding, were inhibited in rodent cells . This interest in viral budding came to define Bieniasz's career. Bieniasz showed that the retroviral protein Gag assembles at the plasma membrane, recruiting the viral genome by hijacking a specialized cellular protein complex involved in membrane vesicle trafficking, the ESCRT complex. Together with his wife and colleague, Theodora Hatziioannou, they identified several host-specific factors that restrict replication of HIV-1 in macaques. Tetherin, a potent antiviral factor, was also discovered in his lab and shown to be counteracted by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu. Subsequently, another inhibitor of HIV-1 replication was discovered in his lab, Mx2, a cellular protein shown to inhibit post-entry steps of the HIV-1 infection. In recent years, Paul Bieniasz's group has focused on viral RNA interactions with cellular proteins; in particular, his group showed that APOBEC3G is recruited to virions by interaction with the viral RNA, and that CG-depletion of HIV-1 genomes is a mechanism to evade the antiviral, RNA-binding protein ZAP.

While other members of the family such as APOBEC3G are believed to act by editing ssDNA by removing an amino group from cytosine in DNA, introducing a cytosine to uracil change which can ultimately lead to a cytosine to thymine mutation, one study suggests that APOBEC3A can inhibit parvoviruses by another mechanism. The cellular function of APOBEC3A is likely to be the destruction of foreign DNA through extensive deamination of cytosine.",

            "document": "Human foamy virus . Most of the differences between the spumaviruses and the other retroviruses come from the life cycle. Some of the main differences are that FV buds from the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the plasma membrane; this difference gives FV a unique morphology. FV is characterized by an immature looking core with an electron lucent center with glycoprotein spikes on the surface. FV replication more closely resembles the Hepadnaviridae, which are another family of reverse transcriptase encoding viruses. Reverse transcription of the genome occurs at a later step in the replication cycle, which results in the infectious particles having DNA rather than RNA, this also leads to less integration in the host genome. The DNA found is linear and the length of the genome. The genome encodes the usual retroviral genes pol, gag, and env as well as two additional genes tas or bel-1 and bet. The role for bet is not quite clear, research has shown that it is dispensable for replication of the virus in tissue culture. Recently, a novel mechanism was reported where foamy virus accessory protein Bet (unlike HIV-1 Vif) impaired the cytoplasmic solubility of APOBEC3G. The tas gene, however, is required for replication. It encodes a protein that functions in transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. FV has a second promoter, the internal promoter (IP) which is located in the env gene. The IP drives expression of the tas and bet genes. The IP is also unique in that the virus has the capacity to transcribe mRNAs from it; usually the complex retroviruses exclusively express transcripts from the LTR. The structural genes of FV are another one of its unique features. The Gag protein is not efficiently cleaved into the mature virus which lends to the immature morphology. The Pol precursor protein is only partially cleaved; the integrase domain is removed by viral protease. As in other retroviruses, the Env protein is cleaved into surface and transmembrane domains but the FV Env protein also contains an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal which is part of why the virus buds from the endoplasmic reticulum. Another area of difference between FV and other retroviruses is the possibility of recycling the core once the virus is in the cell.",

            "document": "Discovery and development of HIV-protease inhibitors . HIV belongs to the class of viruses called retroviruses, which carry genetic information in the form of RNA. HIV infects T cells that carry the CD4 antigen on their surface. When HIV infects its target cell it requires fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The first step is the interaction between envelope proteins of the virus (gp120, gp41) and specific host-cell surface receptors (e.g. CD4 receptor) on the target cell. Then the virus binds to the chemokine coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5, resulting in conformational changes in the envelope proteins. This fusion creates a pore through which the viral capsid enters the cell. Following entry into the cell the RNA of the virus is reverse-transcribed to DNA by the first virally encoded enzyme, the reverse transcriptase. The viral DNA enters the nucleus where it is integrated into the genetic material of the cell by the integrase, a second virally encoded enzyme. Activation of the host cell leads to the transcription of the viral DNA into mRNA. The mRNA is then translated into viral proteins and the third virally encoded enzyme, namely HIV protease, is required to cleave a viral polyprotein precursor into individual mature proteins. The viral RNA and viral proteins assemble at the surface of the cell into new virions. The virions bud from the cell and are released to infect other cells. All infected cells are eventually killed because of this extensive cell damage, from the destruction of the host's genetic system to the budding and release of virions.",

The HCV genome is translated to produce a single protein of around 3011 amino acids. The polyprotein is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular proteases to produce three structural (virion-associated) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins. Alternatively, a frameshift may occur in the Core region to produce an Alternate Reading Frame Protein (ARFP). HCV encodes two proteases, the NS2 cysteine autoprotease and the NS3-4A serine protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes places via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, which produces a negative strand RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template for the production of new positive strand viral genomes. Nascent genomes can then be translated, further replicated or packaged within new virus particles.

Their life cycle is thought to begin with a virion attaching to specific cell-surface receptors such as C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, or integrins, which is followed by fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The virions taken up by the cell then travel to acidic endosomes and lysosomes where the viral envelope glycoprotein GP is cleaved. This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid. The \"Ebolavirus\" structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the \"L\" gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane from which they bud. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.",

SAMHD1 is a host factor found in human myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, that restricts HIV-1 replication by depleting the cytoplasmic pool of deoxynucleoside triphosphates needed for viral DNA production. SAMHD1 does not, however, restrict HIV-2 replication in myeloid cells due to the presence of viral Vpx. Vpx counteracts restriction by inducing the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of SAMHD1. Vpx-mediated degradation of SAMHD1 therefore decreases deoxynucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis, thereby increasing the availability of dNTPs for viral reverse transcription in the cytoplasm. It has been postulated that SAMHD1 degradation is required for HIV-2 replication because the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) is less active than the HIV-1 RT, which would be the reason for the absence of Vpx from HIV-1. Because Vpx is required for HIV-2 reverse transcription and the early stages of the viral life cycle, it is packaged into virions in significant amounts.",
