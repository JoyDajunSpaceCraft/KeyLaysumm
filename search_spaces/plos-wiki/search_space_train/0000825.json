            "document": "MAPK networks . Plants have many protection mechanisms to cope with stresses from the environment, which include ultraviolet light, cold or hot weather, windy days, and mechanical wounding. There are multiple pathways, but one pathway that plants have been able to develop is a self-defense mechanism by recognize pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via cell surface-located pathogen-recognition receptors. These receptors induce intracellular signal pathways within the plant cells, while also resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity. Responses to PAMPs target broadly instead of specifically. This immunity requires downstream components via the MAPK cascade to activate the MAP kinases. The flagellin, a peptide of flg22, triggers a rapid and strong activation of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6. MPK4 and MPK6 can be activated by harpin proteins. MPK3 and MPK6 are very similar proteins and have a function as regulators in abscission, stomatal development, signaling various abiotic stresses, and defense responses to certain pathogens. Experimentation has proposed that the MAPK module MEKK1-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 may be responsible for flg22 signal transmission. All of the proposed modules appear to be correct expect for MEKK1 because plants with \"mekk1\" mutated have a compromised flg22-triggered activation of MPK4, yet they have normal activation of MPK3 and MPK6. Data has shown that MAPK cascade is composed of MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6 in response to fungal pathogens. The observation shows that the activation of MPK3/MPK6 in conditional gain-of-function plants for MKK4/MKK5 or MEKK1/MKKKa is sufficient to induce camalexin, which is a major phytoalexin in \"Arabidopsis.\" The stomata are considered to be the entry point for pathogenic invaders because microbial invaders enter the plant at the stomata. A recent study has shown that MAPK cascades play a role in abiotic and biotic stress responses. The main pathways in stomatal development and dynamics are MPK3 and MPK6. During a drought, the stomata closes and is believed to be mediated by the phytohormone, abscisic acid, and involves MKK1, MPK3, and MPK6. Another way of closing the stomata is through a closing process that is called pathogen-induced, which is an innate response from the plant. \"Campestris (Xcc)\" excretes a chemical that reverts stomatal closure that was caused by bacteria and abscisic acid (ABA). Most stomata close in the presents of ABA, but some are unresponsive to bacteria. In \"Arabidopsis\" \"Xcc\" does not revert bacteria-induced or ABA-induced stomatal closure. Scientists are not certain if MAPK cascades are responsible for the signaling, so further investigation is needed for this.",

            "document": "MAPK networks . The identification of MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4 in pathogen signaling has been a tremendous finding. \"Mekk1, mkk1/mkk2\" double and \"mpk4\" mutations are dwarfed and acquire too much of reactive oxygen species. The mutations are considered to be from the enhancement of SA levels, which is partially reversed by bacterial SA hydrolase. \"Mekk1, mkk1/mkk2\" double and \"mpk4\" mutations have cell death occur spontaneously, pathogenesis-related genes and increased resistance to pathogens. MEKK1 appears to have deregulation pathways that are unknown and do not involve MKK1/MKK2 nor MPK4. MEKK1 interact with WRKY53, which is responsible for \"mekk1\" genes set, and alter the activity of WRKY53 that is a short portion of MAPK signaling. Substrates of MPK4 are three proteins: WRKY33, WRKY25, and MKS1. Ternary MKS1-MPK4-WRKY33 complexes have been recognized by nuclear extracts. Recruitment of WRKY33 depends on the phosphorylation of MPK4. Once activated, MPK3 phosphorylates MKS1, which releases WRKY33 from the ternary complex. The free WRKY33 is believed to induce transcription on target genes., allowing for a negative regulation by MPK4. Pathogens have developed mechanisms that inactivate PAMP-induced signaling pathways through the MAPK networks. Andrea Pitzschke and her colleges claim \u201cAvrPto and AvrPtoB interact with the FLS2 receptor and its co-receptor BAK1. AvrPtoB catalyzes the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of FLS2\u201d (Pitzschke 3). AvrPto interacts with BAK1 and interrupts the binding of FLS2. \"Pseudomonas syringae\" have HopAI1, which is a phosphothreonin lyase, and dephosphorylates the threonine residue at the upstream MAPKKs. HopAI1 interacts with MPK3 and MPK6 allowing for flg22 activation to occur. In certain soil-borne pathogens that carry flagellin variants cannot be detected by FLS2, but there is still a triggered innate immune response. The immune response has been shown to be from the EF-Tu protein. Flg22, elf18, FLS2 and EFR have receptors that are in the same subfamily of LRR-RLKs, LRRXII. This means that elf18 and flg22 induce extracellular alkalization, rapid activation of MAPKs, and gene responses that are similar to each other. Although there appears to be an important relationship between MAPKs with EF-Tu-triggered defense, the evidence remains to be unclear. The reason for this unclear relationship is because of \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens,\" which infects into segments of plant DNA.\u00a0 EFR1 mutants do not recognize EF-Tu, but there is no research on MAPK activities and \"efr1.\" Initiation of defense signaling can be a positive effect to the plant pathogens because activating MPK3 in response to flg22 causes phosphorylation and translocation of virE2 interacting protein 1 (VIP1). VIP1 serves as a shuttle for the pathogenic T-DNA, but the induction of defense genes can occur as well. This allows for the spreading and cessation of the pathogen in the plant, but the pathogen can overcome the problem by attacking VIP1 for proteasome degradation by VirF, which is a virulence factor that encodes an F-box protein.",

Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in \"Arabidopsis\" (FLS2, 2000).

SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called \"broad spectrum\". SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or \"pathogenesis-related\" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA).

The identification of MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4 in pathogen signaling has been a tremendous finding. \"Mekk1, mkk1/mkk2\" double and \"mpk4\" mutations are dwarfed and acquire too much of reactive oxygen species. The mutations are considered to be from the enhancement of SA levels, which is partially reversed by bacterial SA hydrolase. \"Mekk1, mkk1/mkk2\" double and \"mpk4\" mutations have cell death occur spontaneously, pathogenesis-related genes and increased resistance to pathogens. MEKK1 appears to have deregulation pathways that are unknown and do not involve MKK1/MKK2 nor MPK4. MEKK1 interact with WRKY53, which is responsible for \"mekk1\" genes set, and alter the activity of WRKY53 that is a short portion of MAPK signaling. Substrates of MPK4 are three proteins: WRKY33, WRKY25, and MKS1. Ternary MKS1-MPK4-WRKY33 complexes have been recognized by nuclear extracts. Recruitment of WRKY33 depends on the phosphorylation of MPK4. Once activated, MPK3 phosphorylates MKS1, which releases WRKY33 from the ternary complex. The free WRKY33 is believed to induce transcription on target genes., allowing for a negative regulation by MPK4. Pathogens have developed mechanisms that inactivate PAMP-induced signaling pathways through the MAPK networks. Andrea Pitzschke and her colleges claim \u201cAvrPto and AvrPtoB interact with the FLS2 receptor and its co-receptor BAK1. AvrPtoB catalyzes the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of FLS2\u201d (Pitzschke 3). AvrPto interacts with BAK1 and interrupts the binding of FLS2. \"Pseudomonas syringae\" have HopAI1, which is a phosphothreonin lyase, and dephosphorylates the threonine residue at the upstream MAPKKs. HopAI1 interacts with MPK3 and MPK6 allowing for flg22 activation to occur. In certain soil-borne pathogens that carry flagellin variants cannot be detected by FLS2, but there is still a triggered innate immune response. The immune response has been shown to be from the EF-Tu protein. Flg22, elf18, FLS2 and EFR have receptors that are in the same subfamily of LRR-RLKs, LRRXII. This means that elf18 and flg22 induce extracellular alkalization, rapid activation of MAPKs, and gene responses that are similar to each other. Although there appears to be an important relationship between MAPKs with EF-Tu-triggered defense, the evidence remains to be unclear. The reason for this unclear relationship is because of \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens,\" which infects into segments of plant DNA.\u00a0 EFR1 mutants do not recognize EF-Tu, but there is no research on MAPK activities and \"efr1.\" Initiation of defense signaling can be a positive effect to the plant pathogens because activating MPK3 in response to flg22 causes phosphorylation and translocation of virE2 interacting protein 1 (VIP1). VIP1 serves as a shuttle for the pathogenic T-DNA, but the induction of defense genes can occur as well. This allows for the spreading and cessation of the pathogen in the plant, but the pathogen can overcome the problem by attacking VIP1 for proteasome degradation by VirF, which is a virulence factor that encodes an F-box protein.",

Plants have many protection mechanisms to cope with stresses from the environment, which include ultraviolet light, cold or hot weather, windy days, and mechanical wounding. There are multiple pathways, but one pathway that plants have been able to develop is a self-defense mechanism by recognize pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via cell surface-located pathogen-recognition receptors. These receptors induce intracellular signal pathways within the plant cells, while also resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity. Responses to PAMPs target broadly instead of specifically. This immunity requires downstream components via the MAPK cascade to activate the MAP kinases. The flagellin, a peptide of flg22, triggers a rapid and strong activation of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6. MPK4 and MPK6 can be activated by harpin proteins. MPK3 and MPK6 are very similar proteins and have a function as regulators in abscission, stomatal development, signaling various abiotic stresses, and defense responses to certain pathogens. Experimentation has proposed that the MAPK module MEKK1-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 may be responsible for flg22 signal transmission. All of the proposed modules appear to be correct expect for MEKK1 because plants with \"mekk1\" mutated have a compromised flg22-triggered activation of MPK4, yet they have normal activation of MPK3 and MPK6. Data has shown that MAPK cascade is composed of MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6 in response to fungal pathogens. The observation shows that the activation of MPK3/MPK6 in conditional gain-of-function plants for MKK4/MKK5 or MEKK1/MKKKa is sufficient to induce camalexin, which is a major phytoalexin in \"Arabidopsis.\" The stomata are considered to be the entry point for pathogenic invaders because microbial invaders enter the plant at the stomata. A recent study has shown that MAPK cascades play a role in abiotic and biotic stress responses. The main pathways in stomatal development and dynamics are MPK3 and MPK6. During a drought, the stomata closes and is believed to be mediated by the phytohormone, abscisic acid, and involves MKK1, MPK3, and MPK6. Another way of closing the stomata is through a closing process that is called pathogen-induced, which is an innate response from the plant. \"Campestris (Xcc)\" excretes a chemical that reverts stomatal closure that was caused by bacteria and abscisic acid (ABA). Most stomata close in the presents of ABA, but some are unresponsive to bacteria. In \"Arabidopsis\" \"Xcc\" does not revert bacteria-induced or ABA-induced stomatal closure. Scientists are not certain if MAPK cascades are responsible for the signaling, so further investigation is needed for this.",

Each splitter typically splits the signal from a single fiber into 16, 32, or up to 256 fibers, depending on the manufacturer, and several splitters can be aggregated in a single cabinet. A beam splitter cannot provide any switching or buffering capabilities and doesn't use any power supply; the resulting connection is called a point-to-multipoint link. For such a connection, the optical network terminals on the customer's end must perform some special functions which would not otherwise be required. For example, due to the absence of switching, each signal leaving the central office must be broadcast to all users served by that splitter (including to those for whom the signal is not intended). It is therefore up to the optical network terminal to filter out any signals intended for other customers. In addition, since splitters have no buffering, each individual optical network terminal must be coordinated in a multiplexing scheme to prevent signals sent by customers from colliding with each other. Two types of multiplexing are possible for achieving this: wavelength-division multiplexing and time-division multiplexing. With wavelength-division multiplexing, each customer transmits their signal using a unique wavelength. With time-division multiplexing (TDM), the customers \"take turns\" transmitting information.

An emerging paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive tasks are performed not by individual brain regions working in isolation, but by networks consisting of several discrete brain regions that are said to be \"functionally connected\" due to tightly coupled activity. Functional connectivity may be measured as long-range synchronization of the EEG, MEG, or other dynamic brain signals. Synchronized brain regions may also be identified using spatial independent component analysis. The set of identified brain areas that are linked together in a large-scale network varies with cognitive function. When the cognitive state is not explicit (i.e., the subject is at \"rest\"), the large scale brain network is a resting state network (RSN). As a physical system with graph-like properties, a large scale brain network has both nodes and edges, and cannot be identified simply by the co-activation of brain areas.

Large scale brain networks are identified by their function, and provide a coherent framework for understanding cognition by offering a neural model of how different cognitive functions emerge when different sets of brain regions join together as self-organized coalitions. Disruptions in activity in various networks have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, Alzheimer's, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",

As its name suggests, BIK1 is only active after being induced by \"Botrytis\" infection. When \"Botrytis cinerea\" is present, the BIK1 gene is transcribed so that the kinase is present to defend the cell. BIK1 functions to regulate the amount of salicylic acid (SA) present in the cell. When \"Botrytis cinerea\" or \"Alternaria brassicicola\" or any other necrotrophic pathogen is present, BIK1 is transcribed to regulate the pathogen response mechanisms. When BIK1 is present, SA levels decrease, allowing the nectrotrophic response to take place. When nectrotrophic pathogens are not present, BIK1 is not transcribed and SA levels increase, limiting the necrotrophic resistance pathway. Only the pathogenic defense response that is initiated by BIK1 is dependent on SA levels. Non-pathogenic cellular functions occur independently. In terms of non-pathogenic cellular functions, BIK1 is described as a critical component of ET signaling and PAMP-triggered immunity to pathogens. For cellular processes that are not directly related to pathogen resistance or defense, BIK1 does not utilize traditional defense-mediating hormones such as SA, JA, or ACC, but instead utilizes an herbicide, known as paraquat which produces ROIs. It is believed that SA, JA, and ACC have no effect on BIK1 induction because they are likely located downstream from the BIK1 gene, or it is possible that BIK1 operates completely independently. However, it is believed that BIK1 does play a vital role in the ET signaling pathway. Based on the signaling function of BIK1 in ET responses, it is believed that Botrytis-induced kinase1 accumulates response signals that it receives from upstream regulators and then integrates them into its own resistance mechanism.",

Some of these signaling pathways result in the production of proteins, including cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA.

They showed that this system results in a flexibile ultrasensitive response in gene expression. It is flexible in that the degree of ultrasensitivity can be altered by changing expression levels of the dominant-negative inhibitor. Figure 1 in their article illustrates how an active transcription factor can be sequestered by an inhibitor into the inactive complex AB that is unable to bind DNA. This type of mechanism results in an \"all-or-none\" response, or ultransensitivy, when the concentration of the regulatory protein increases to the point of depleting the inhibitor. Robust buffering against a response exists below this concentration threshold, and when it is reached any small increase in input is amplified into a large change in output.",

In their paper Andrikou and Arnone argue that to truly understand the evolution of muscle cells the function of transcriptional regulators must be understood in the context of other external and internal interactions. Through their analysis, Andrikou and Arnone found that there were conserved orthologues of the gene regulatory network in both invertebrate bilaterians and in cnidarians. They argue that having this common, general regulatory circuit allowed for a high degree of divergence from a single well functioning network. Andrikou and Arnone found that the orthologues of genes found in vertebrates had been changed through different types of structural mutations in the invertebrate deuterostomes and protostomes, and they argue that these structural changes in the genes allowed for a large divergence of muscle function and muscle formation in these species. Andrikou and Arnone were able to recognize not only any difference due to mutation in the genes found in vertebrates and invertebrates but also the integration of species specific genes that could also cause divergence from the original gene regulatory network function. Thus, although a common muscle patterning system has been determined, they argue that this could be due to a more ancestral gene regulatory network being coopted several times across lineages with additional genes and mutations causing very divergent development of muscles. Thus it seems that myogenic patterning framework may be an ancestral trait. However, Andrikou and Arnone explain that the basic muscle patterning structure must also be considered in combination with the cis regulatory elements present at different times during development. In contrast with the high level of gene family apparatuses structure, Andrikou and Arnone found that the cis regulatory elements were not well conserved both in time and place in the network which could show a large degree of divergence in the formation of muscle cells. Through this analysis, it seems that the myogenic GRN is an ancestral GRN with actual changes in myogenic function and structure possibly being linked to later coopts of genes at different times and places.",

The availability of the \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" genome sequence and a set of deletion mutants covering 90% of the yeast genome has further enhanced the power of \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" as a model for understanding the regulation of eukaryotic cells. A project underway to analyze the genetic interactions of all double-deletion mutants through synthetic genetic array analysis will take this research one step further. The goal is to form a functional map of the cell's processes. As of 2010 a model of genetic interactions is most comprehensive yet to be constructed, containing \"the interaction profiles for ~75% of all genes in the Budding yeast\". This model was made from 5.4 million two-gene comparisons in which a double gene knockout for each combination of the genes studied was performed. The effect of the double knockout on the fitness of the cell was compared to the expected fitness. Expected fitness is determined from the sum of the results on fitness of single-gene knockouts for each compared gene. When there is a change in fitness from what is expected, the genes are presumed to interact with each other. This was tested by comparing the results to what was previously known. For example, the genes Par32, Ecm30, and Ubp15 had similar interaction profiles to genes involved in the Gap1-sorting module cellular process. Consistent with the results, these genes, when knocked out, disrupted that process, confirming that they are part of it. From this, 170,000 gene interactions were found and genes with similar interaction patterns were grouped together. Genes with similar genetic interaction profiles tend to be part of the same pathway or biological process. This information was used to construct a global network of gene interactions organized by function.

Free Ca levels in the cytoplasm increases in response to a pathogenic infection. Ca signatures of this nature usually activate the plant defense system by inducing defense-related genes and the hypersensitive cell death. CaMs, CMLs and CaM-binding proteins are some of the recently identified elements of the plant defense signaling pathways. Several CML genes in tobacco, bean and tomato are responsive to pathogens. CML43 is a CaM-related protein that, as isolated from APR134 gene in the disease-resistant leaves of \"Arabidopsis\" for gene expression analysis, is rapidly induced when the leaves are inoculated with \"Pseudomonas syringae.\" These genes are also found in tomatoes (\"Solanum lycopersicum).\" The CML43 from the APR134 also binds to Ca ions in vitro which shows that CML43 and APR134 are, hence, involved in the Ca-dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens. The CML9 expression in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is rapidly induced by phytopathogenic bacteria, flagellin and salicylic acid. Expression of soybean SCaM4 and SCaM5 in transgenic \"tobacco\" and \"Arabidopsis\" causes an activation of genes related to pathogen resistance and also results in enhanced resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogen infection. The same is not true for soybean SCaM1 and SCaM2 that are highly conserved CaM isoforms. The \"At\"BAG6 protein is a CaM-binding protein that binds to CaM only in the absence of Ca and not in the presence of it. \"At\"BAG6 is responsible for the hypersensitive response of programmed cell death in order to prevent the spread of pathogen infection or to restrict pathogen growth. Mutations in the CaM binding proteins can lead to severe effects on the defense response of the plants towards pathogen infections. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are functional protein channels in the plasma membrane that have overlapping CaM binding sites transport divalent cations such as Ca. However, the exact role of the positioning of the CNGCs in this pathway for plant defense is still unclear.",

Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell.
