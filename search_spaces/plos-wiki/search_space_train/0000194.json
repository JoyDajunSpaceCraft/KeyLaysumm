In 1999, the virus was introduced into the Western Hemisphere, sparking a series of epidemics.

Most cases have no symptoms, but when present they are usually mild and can resemble dengue fever. Symptoms may include fever, red eyes, joint pain, headache, and a maculopapular rash. Symptoms generally last less than seven days. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Zika fever is mainly spread via the bite of mosquitoes of the \"Aedes\" type. It can also be sexually transmitted and potentially spread by blood transfusions. Infections in pregnant women can spread to the baby. Diagnosis is by testing the blood, urine, or saliva for the presence of the virus's RNA when the person is sick, or the blood for antibodies after symptoms are present more than a week. Prevention involves decreasing mosquito bites in areas where the disease occurs and proper use of condoms. Efforts to prevent bites include the use of insect repellent, covering much of the body with clothing, mosquito nets, and getting rid of standing water where mosquitoes reproduce. There is no effective vaccine. Health officials recommended that women in areas affected by the 2015\u201316 Zika outbreak consider putting off pregnancy and that pregnant women not travel to these areas.

Studies with mosquitoes from the epidemic zone after the outbreak showed that \"Psorophora ferox\" and \"Ochlerotatus scapularis\" could be classified as potential vectors, but \"Ochlerotatus serratus\" was relatively insusceptible. Field investigations in the late 1970s and 1980s showed that \"Ochlerotatus scapularis\", \"Ochlerotatus serratus\" and species of \"Culex\" (\"Melanoconion\") were the predominant mosquitoes in the epidemic zone, and that \"Ochlerotatus scapularis\" was the most common and abundant mosquito in human settlements and human-made environments. Outside the epidemic zone, laboratory studies have shown that \"Culex tarsalis\" mosquitoes from Arizona and \"Culex pipiens pipiens\" mosquitoes from Illinois were relatively efficient experimental vectors; Tennessee \"Culex pipiens\" subspecies and Argentina \"Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus\" were moderately efficient experimental vectors; Louisiana \"Psorophora ferox\", and \"Culex nigripalpus\" and \"Culex (Melanoconion) opisthopus\" from Florida were relatively inefficient experimental vectors. \"Psorophora ferox\" and \"Aedes scapularis\" were shown to be susceptible to per os infection with Rocio virus and could transmit the virus by bite following an incubation period, whereas infection rates in \"Ochlerotatus serratus\" did not exceed 36% and an ID50 could not be calculated for this species so it is unlikely to be an epidemiologically important vector of Rocio virus.",

The connection between arthropods and disease was not postulated until 1881 when Cuban doctor and scientist Carlos Finlay proposed that yellow fever may be transmitted by mosquitoes instead of human contact, a reality that was verified by Major Walter Reed in 1901. The primary vector, \"Aedes aegypti\", had spread globally from the 15th to the 19th centuries as a result of globalization and the slave trade. This geographic spreading caused dengue fever epidemics throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, and later, in 1906, transmission by the \"Aedes\" mosquitoes was confirmed, making yellow fever and dengue fever the first two diseases known to be caused by viruses. Thomas Milton Rivers published the first clear description of a virus as distinct from a bacterium in 1927. The discovery of the West Nile virus came in 1937, and has since been found in \"Culex\" populations causing epidemics throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. In 1999, the virus was introduced into the Western Hemisphere, sparking a series of epidemics. During the latter half of the 20th century, Dengue fever reemerged as a global disease, with the virus spreading geographically due to urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming, and continues to cause at least 50 million infections per year, making Dengue fever the most common and clinically important arboviral disease.",

            "document": "2015\u201316 Zika virus epidemic . The specific event that brought the virus to Brazil was uncertain until March 2016. Brazilian researchers had suggested that the Zika virus arrived during the 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament. French researchers speculated the virus arrived shortly afterwards, in August 2014, when canoeing teams from French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Easter Island, and the Cook Islands, which had been or were experiencing Zika outbreaks, attended the Va'a World Sprint Championships in Rio de Janeiro. However, the outbreak in French Polynesia is known to have peaked and declined precipitously by February 2014, lending doubt to the suggestion the virus arrived later that year in Brazil with spectators and competitors. In March 2016, a study published in \"Science\", which developed a \"molecular clock\" based on the count of virus mutations in a relatively small sample, suggested Zika virus arrived in the Americas (most likely in Brazil) from French Polynesia between May and December 2013, well before the World Cup and Va'a Championships. In the \"Science\" article, Faria and colleagues managed to trace the origins of the virus strain that is circulating in Brazil and found that this strain has little genetic variability when compared to the strain of French Polynesia; after relating the number of travellers arriving in Brazil from French Polynesia with the cases reported and the events happening in that year, the team was able to deduce that the virus arrived in Brazil in 2013 during the Confederation Cup, when Tahiti's team played against other teams in a few Brazilian cities, which attracted many tourists from both places. Zika virus usually has very mild, or no symptoms, so it took almost a year for Brazil to confirm the first case of the disease. By then the outbreak was already widespread. Factors associated with the rapid spread of Zika virus in Brazil include the non-immune population, high population density, tropical climate and inadequate control of \"Aedes\" mosquitoes in the country.",

The mosquito species \"Anopheles gambiae\", which is notorious mainly as a malaria vector, has been demonstrated to be a competent vector for \"Rickettsia felis\". More unexpectedly, cells of some important disease vector species of mosquitoes in the genus \"Aedes\", which is most commonly seen as a vector for arboviruses, support growth of \"Rickettsia felis\". In addition, in tropical regions where \"Aedes albopictus\" and \"Aedes aegypti\" are established disease vectors and ectoparasites of humans, patients have tested positive for \"Rickettsia felis\". To some authorities this suggests that \"Aedes\" species might be able to infect their hosts with \"Rickettsia felis\", and that patients in, or returning from, the tropics with fevers of unknown origin, should be tested for \"Rickettsia felis\" infection. They see as very real, the possibility that \"Rickettsia felis\" might be the next mosquito-borne pathogen to emerge as a multi-continental disease outbreak.",
