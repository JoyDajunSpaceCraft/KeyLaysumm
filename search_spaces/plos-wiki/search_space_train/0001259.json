            "document": "Pat Nuttall . In the early 1980s, Nuttall started to study viruses transmitted by ticks, initially focusing on orbiviruses, nairoviruses and thogotoviruses. While performing experiments designed to explore whether \"Thogoto virus\", an influenza-like virus, can be transmitted between ticks during mating, Nuttall and her colleagues unexpectedly found that control ticks became infected. They discovered that the virus can be transmitted between infected and uninfected ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, without the virus being present at a detectable level in the blood. With Milan Labuda, Nuttall subsequently demonstrated the same phenomenon with tick-borne encephalitis virus, a better-understood arthropod-transmitted virus.",

This bacterium invades and proliferates in neutrophil cells of the blood. This depletes these antibacterial cells and renders the host susceptible to opportunistic infections by \"Staphylococcus aureus\" bacteria which invade joints and cause the crippling disease of sheep called tick pyaemia. \"Anaplasma marginale\" infects marginal areas of red blood cells of cattle and causes anaplasmosis wherever boophilid ticks occur as transmitters. \"Anaplasma centrale\" tends to infect the central region of red blood cells, and is sufficiently closely related to \"An. marginale\" to have been used from long ago as a live vaccine to protect cattle against the more virulent \"An. marginale\". Sheep and goats suffer disease from infection with \"Anaplasma ovis\" which is transmitted similarly to the anaplasmas described above. \"Ehrlichia ruminantium\" (formerly \"Cowdria ruminantium\") is transmitted mainly by \"Amblyomma hebraeum\" and \"Am. variegatum\" in Africa, causing the severe disease heartwater in cattle, sheep, and goats. This disease is named after the prominent sign of pericardial edema. The bacteria infect the brain, causing prostration. Heartwater also occurs on the Caribbean islands, having spread there on shipments of cattle from Africa about 150 years ago, before anything was known of tick transmitted microbes.",

More commonly, a larval tick feeds upon a domestic cow, an African buffalo or a water buffalo, releasing the parasites into the animal's bloodstream. The involvement of the larval stage of the ticks in the cycle is specific to \"B. bovis\"; other \"Babesia\" species only involve adult ticks. The parasites then invade individual red blood cells, multiplying and destroying the host cells until the animal is stricken with hemolytic anemia. Adult ticks which feed upon infected cattle are infected themselves, completing the cycle. In humans, infection is rare and usually only affects splenectomized patients.",

Dogs, both domestic and wild, act as reservoir hosts for this pathogen and are the primary hosts of brown dog ticks. Brown dog ticks become carriers of the pathogen when they take a blood meal from a rickessemic dog.
