Though this observation seemed to suggest that a familial genetic susceptibility might have played a role in human infection, a study by researchers at the Harvard School of public health noted no significant familial pattern of infection. Clearly, those whose immune systems are best able to fight off the virus are the most likely to survive a pandemic. Those with impairment of the needed immune function, whether from familial genetics or from AIDS, have poorer chances. Moreover, the health care system is generally expected to be overwhelmed throughout a pandemic.

Roughly three times per century, a pandemic occurs, which infects a large proportion of the world's population and can kill tens of millions of people (see pandemics section). One study estimated that if a strain with similar virulence to the 1918 influenza emerged today, it could kill between 50 and 80 million people. New influenza viruses are constantly evolving by mutation or by reassortment. Mutations can cause small changes in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens on the surface of the virus. This is called antigenic drift, which slowly creates an increasing variety of strains until one evolves that can infect people who are immune to the pre-existing strains. This new variant then replaces the older strains as it rapidly sweeps through the human population, often causing an epidemic. However, since the strains produced by drift will still be reasonably similar to the older strains, some people will still be immune to them. In contrast, when influenza viruses reassort, they acquire completely new antigens\u2014for example by reassortment between avian strains and human strains; this is called antigenic shift. If a human influenza virus is produced that has entirely new antigens, everybody will be susceptible, and the novel influenza will spread uncontrollably, causing a pandemic. In contrast to this model of pandemics based on antigenic drift and shift, an alternative approach has been proposed where the periodic pandemics are produced by interactions of a fixed set of viral strains with a human population with a constantly changing set of immunities to different viral strains.",

Review of patient ages and outcomes reveals that H5N1 attacks are especially lethal in pre-adults and young adults, while older victims tend to have milder attacks and to survive.

Few persons over 50 years of age seem to have become infected by H5N1, and very few have died after suffering an H5N1 attack. Instead, the age-fatality curve of H5N1 influenza attacks in humans resembles that of the 1918 Spanish pandemic flu, and is the opposite of the mortality curve of seasonal flu strains, since seasonal influenza preferentially kills the elderly and does not kill by cytokine storm. An additional factor which may be active is that H1N1 was the predominate human flu circulating from 1918 until 1957 when the H2N2 strain emerged. Hence those over 50 years old have had the opportunity to be exposed to H1N1, and to develop some immune response to the N1 group contained in that human form of flu. Likewise, annual flu vaccination includes inoculation against a type-A human H1N1 flu, leading to the possibility that the annual flu shot or Flumist inoculation might confer some immunity against H5N1 bird flu infection, and indeed testing the blood of volunteers to look for immune response to H5N1 found that some blood samples showed immunity, but more of the blood samples of persons who had received the flu shot showed an immune response.",

Influenza A viruses can be further classified into subtypes, such as A/H1N1 and A/H3N2. Here, subtypes are denoted according to their hemagglutinin (H or HA) and neuraminidase (N or NA) genes, which as surface proteins, act as the primary targets for the humoral immune response. Influenza viruses circulate in other species as well, most notably as swine influenza and avian influenza. Through reassortment, genetic sequences from swine and avian influenza occasionally enter the human population. If a particular hemagglutinin or neuraminidase has been circulating outside the human population, then humans will lack immunity to this protein and an influenza pandemic may follow a host switch event, as seen in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009. After introduction into the human population, a lineage of influenza generally persists through antigenic drift, in which HA and NA continually accumulate mutations allowing viruses to infect hosts immune to earlier forms of the virus. These lineages of influenza show recurrent seasonal epidemics in temperate regions and less periodic transmission in the tropics. Generally, at each pandemic event, the new form of the virus outcompetes existing lineages. The study of viral phylodynamics in influenza primarily focuses on the continual circulation and evolution of epidemic influenza, rather than on pandemic emergence. Of central interest to the study of viral phylodynamics is the distinctive phylogenetic tree of epidemic influenza A/H3N2, which shows a single predominant trunk lineage that persists through time and side branches that persist for only 1\u20135 years before going extinct (see figure 5).",

Other leading researchers indicated that all segments of the virus were in fact swine in origin, despite it being a multiple reassortment.

This is similar to a lock recognizing a key. After an infection, the body produces many more of these virus-specific immune receptors, which prevent re-infection by this particular strain of the virus and produce acquired immunity. Similarly, a vaccine against a virus works by teaching the immune system to recognize the antigens exhibited by this virus. However, viral genomes are constantly mutating, producing new forms of these antigens. If one of these new forms of an antigen is sufficiently different from the old antigen, it will no longer bind to the receptors of the body cells, and viruses with these new antigens can infect the body cell as it avoids the immunity to the original strain of the virus. When such a change occurs, people who have had the illness in the past are therefore not immune to the new strain of the virus (as the new strain of the virus has a different antigen which the body cell cannot recognise) and thus the vaccines against the original virus will be less effective against the illness. Two processes drive the antigens to change: antigenic drift and antigenic shift, antigenic drift being the more common. The rate of antigenic drift is dependent on two characteristics: the duration of the epidemic, and the strength of host immunity. A longer epidemic allows for selection pressure to continue over an extended period of time and stronger host immune responses increase selection pressure for development of novel antigens.",

Recent studies show the crucial role of proliferating, activated effector memory Th1 CD4+ T cells in effective antitumor immunity and reveal that CD4+ T cells induce more durable immune-mediated tumor control than CD8+ T cells. Given that CD4+ T cells are known to play such a central role in regulating virtually all antigen-specific immune responses, they are still not paid much attention to playing a role in immune responses to tumor antigens. The preferred attention to antitumor responses by CD8+ T cells stems from two facts: first, most tumors are positive for MHC class one but negative for MHC class two; and second, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are able to induce tumor killing upon direct recognition of peptide antigens, presented by the tumor\u2019s MHC class one molecules. This preference has been bolstered by numerous adoptive transfer studies in which CD8+ T cell lines and CD8+ clones specific for tumor antigens\u2014that have been stimulated in \"vitro\"\u2014can mediate antitumor immunity when transferred back into tumor-bearing hosts; furthermore, recent reports suggest that immunization\u2014using either adjuvant or dendritic cells with pure tumor peptides\u2014can result in productive antitumor immunity that is restricted by MHC class one. Finally, elimination of CD8+ T cells from mice\u2014at least partially abrogates antitumor immunity induced by most cancer vaccines.

Studies of human subjects with a history of leishmania infection suggest that modulation of CD8 suppressor T cells is, at least partly, mediated by cytokines. Leishmania specific CD4 helper T cells predominate in adults with strong protective immunity (skin-test positive with no history of clinical infection). When added to autologous leishmania infected macrophages these T cells cause parasite death and secretion of large amounts of interferon-gamma and lymphotoxin. CD8 T suppressor cells predominate in patients with no protective immunity (visceral leishmaniasis patients). When added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated after successful treatment, these T cells inhibit interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation and increase interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 secretion. A soluble factor(s) generated by antigen or phytohemagglutinin stimulation of leishmania-specific CD4 helper T cells from skin-test positive adults killed CD8 T cells but not CD4 helper T cells when added to culture media. Soluble factors generated by antigen stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from skin-test positive adults prevented CD8 suppressor T cell mediated increases in interleukin-10 secretion. These findings suggest that antigen stimulation of CD4 helper T cells results in production of cytokines that kill or down regulate CD8 T suppressor cells.

Delineating how CD4 T cells are depleted and how chronic inflammation and immune activation are induced lies at the heart of understanding HIV pathogenesis\u2013\u2013one of the top priorities for HIV research by the Office of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health. Recent studies demonstrated that caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, drives CD4 T-cell depletion and inflammation by HIV. These are the two signature events that propel HIV disease progression to AIDS. Pyroptosis appears to create a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells and other immune cells (including macrophages and neutrophils) release inflammatory signals that recruit more cells into the infected lymphoid tissues to die. The feed-forward nature of this inflammatory response produces chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Identifying pyroptosis as the predominant mechanism that causes CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation, provides novel therapeutic opportunities, namely caspase-1 which controls the pyroptotic pathway. In this regard, pyroptosis of CD4 T cells and secretion of pro-inflmammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 can be blocked in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, which has already proven to be safe and well tolerated in phase II human clinical trials. These findings could propel development of an entirely new class of \u201canti-AIDS\u201d therapies that act by targeting the host rather than the virus. Such agents would almost certainly be used in combination with ART. By promoting \u201ctolerance\u201d of the virus instead of suppressing its replication, VX-765 or related drugs may mimic the evolutionary solutions occurring in multiple monkey hosts (e.g. the sooty mangabey) infected with species-specific lentiviruses that have led to a lack of disease, no decline in CD4 T-cell counts, and no chronic inflammation.",

A second defense of vertebrates against viruses, cell-mediated immunity, involves immune cells known as T cells: the body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and if a T cell recognizes a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. This mechanism is jump-started by certain vaccinations.",

The arrival of natural killer cells (NK cells) at the site of infection limits viral proliferation in myocytes. Conversely, while certain cytokines released from immune cells have protective effects, others such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) have deleterious effects on heart cells. Moreover, peak concentrations of T cells in the myocardium during days 7-14 play important roles in both viral clearance and immune mediated cardiac damage. T-cells not only lyse and destroy infected myocytes, but due to molecular mimicry, they also destroy normal, healthy cardiac cells, further driving the heart towards dilated cardiomyopathy.",

Recent studies employed an ex vivo human lymphoid aggregate culture (HLAC) system formed with fresh human tonsil or spleen tissue to model molecular and cellular events in human tissues during in vivo HIV infection. These studies found that >95% of CD4 T cells die because of abortive HIV infection. These dying cells are resting and thus are nonpermissive for productive HIV infection. Full viral replication was limited to the \u223c5% of activated CD4 T cells present in these tissues; these cells die by apoptosis. Abortive HIV infection occurs due to slowing of reverse transcription promoting cytosolic DNA accumulation. This viral DNA is sensed by gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), which produces an innate immune response against the virus by activating caspase 1 in IFI16 inflammasomes and inducing pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death. These findings cast CD4 T-cell death during HIV infection in a different light. Rather than the virus playing a major role, it is the host response to viral DNA produced during abortive infection that triggers CD4 T-cell death. Further, these findings identify novel drug targets that may be exploited to both block CD4 T cell demise and the chronic inflammatory response generated during pyroptosis.",

Activation of CD4 T cells occurs through the simultaneous engagement of the T-cell receptor and a co-stimulatory molecule (like CD28, or ICOS) on the T cell by the major histocompatibility complex (MHCII) peptide and co-stimulatory molecules on the APC. Both are required for production of an effective immune response; in the absence of co-stimulation, T cell receptor signalling alone results in anergy. The signalling pathways downstream from co-stimulatory molecules usually engages the PI3K pathway generating PIP3 at the plasma membrane and recruiting PH domain containing signaling molecules like PDK1 that are essential for the activation of PKC\u03b8, and eventual IL-2 production. Optimal CD8 T cell response relies on CD4 signalling. CD4 cells are useful in the initial antigenic activation of na\u00efve CD8 T cells, and sustaining memory CD8 T cells in the aftermath of an acute infection. Therefore, activation of CD4 T cells can be beneficial to the action of CD8 T cells.",

IL-2/IL2R also promotes the differentiation of T cells into effector T cells and into memory T cells when the initial T cells is also stimulated by an antigen, thus helping the body fight off infections.

It has been shown that homeostatic proliferation induces not only quantitative changes in T cell cohorts, but qualitative changes as well, such as increased function and the development of a memory-cell phenotype. The mechanism of these changes has been shown to be primarily due to upregulation of a group of cytokines including IL-7 and IL-15 induced by lymphodepletion. Additionally, lymphodepletion is a non-selective method of eliminating several known regulatory, or immunosuppressive, subsets of immune cells, such as regulatory T cells.",
