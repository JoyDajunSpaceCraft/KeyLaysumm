Therefore, microbes have evolved to secret siderophores, Fe-binding peptides, into the surroundings and then actively transport the Fe-complex back into the cell by active transport. This can also be seen with pathogenic bacteria inside its host, where iron is bound tightly by haemoglobin, transferrin, lactoferrin and ferritin, and thus low in concentration (10 mol L).

The Kd value of the siderocalin/siderophore interaction, measured by fluorescence quenching (Kd= 0.4 nM), indicates that siderocalin can capture siderophores with high affinity. This Kd value is similar to that of the FepA bacterial receptor (Kd= 0.3 nM). Siderophore/siderocalin binding is directed by electrostatic interactions. Specifically, the mechanism involves hybrid electrostatic and cation-pi interactions in the positively charged protein calyx. The siderophore is positioned in the centre of the siderocalin calyx, and is associated with multiple direct polar interactions. Structural analysis of the siderocalin/siderophore interaction has shown that the siderophore is accompanied by a poor and diffuse quality of electron density, with the majority of the ligand exposed to the solvent when the siderophore is fit in the calyx. Siderocalin typically does not bind hydroxamate-based siderophores because these substrates do not have the necessary aromatic electronic structure for cation-pi interactions. In order to acquire iron in the presence of siderocalin, pathogenic bacteria utilize several siderophores that do not bind to siderocalin, or structurally modify siderophores to inhibit siderocalin binding. Siderocalin can bind soluble siderophores of mycobacteria, including carboxymycobactins.  In vivo studies have shown that the binding interactions between carboxymycobactin and siderocalin serve to protect the host organism from mycobacterial infections, with siderocalin inhibiting mycobacterial iron acquisition. Siderocalin can sequester ferric carboxymycobactins by employing a polyspecific recognition mechanism.

Virtually all this iron is in the iron(III) state and complexed to organic ligands.

This hypothesis has been tested on more than 10 different occasions and in all cases, massive blooms resulted. However, the blooms persisted for variable periods of time. An interesting observation made in some of these studies was that the concentration of the organic ligands increased over a short time span in order to match the concentration of added iron, thus implying biological origin and in view of their affinity for iron possibly being of a siderophore or siderophore-like nature. Significantly, heterotrophic bacteria were also found to markedly increase in number in the iron-induced blooms.

Because Fe has a very low solubility, most of the Fe ions in the bacteria\u2019s surrounding environment (e.g. soil) exist as iron oxides or hydroxides, and so the number of free Fe is low. Therefore, microbes have evolved to secret siderophores, Fe-binding peptides, into the surroundings and then actively transport the Fe-complex back into the cell by active transport. This can also be seen with pathogenic bacteria inside its host, where iron is bound tightly by haemoglobin, transferrin, lactoferrin and ferritin, and thus low in concentration (10 mol L). Here it secrets siderophores which has a higher affinity (with a formation constant, or ([ML])/([M][L]), of 10)to Fe than the host's iron-binding proteins, and so will remove iron and then transported inside the cell. \"Bacillus anthracis\", a Gram-positive bacteria that causes anthrax, secretes two siderophores: bacillibactin and petrobactin. \"Escherichia coli\" secrets many iron-siderophore transports, but produce only one siderophore\u2014enterobactin.

            "document": "Ferritin . Vertebrate ferritin consists of two or three subunits which are named based on their molecular weight: L \"light\", H \"heavy\", and M \"middle\" subunits. The M subunit has only been reported in bullfrogs. In bacteria and archaea, ferritin consists of one subunit type. H and M subunits of eukaryotic ferritin and all subunits of bacterial and archaeal ferritin are H-type and have ferroxidase activity, which is the conversion of iron from the ferrous (Fe) to ferric (Fe) forms. This limits the deleterious reaction which occurs between ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide known as the Fenton reaction which produces the highly damaging hydroxyl radical. The ferroxidase activity occurs at a diiron binding site in the middle of each H-type subunits. After oxidation of Fe(II), the Fe(III) product stays metastably in the ferroxidase center and is displaced by Fe(II), a mechanism that appears to be common among ferritins of all three kingdoms of life. The light chain of ferritin has no ferroxidase activity but may be responsible for the electron transfer across the protein cage.",

The ferritin level, a measure of the body's iron stores, should be at least 50\u00a0\u00b5g/L (or ng/mL, an equivalent unit) for those with RLS. Oral iron supplements can increase ferritin levels. For some people, increasing ferritin will eliminate or reduce RLS symptoms; a ferritin level of 50\u00a0\u00b5g/L is not sufficient for some and increasing the level to 80\u00a0\u00b5g/L may further reduce symptoms. However, at least 40% of people will not notice any improvement. It is not advised to take oral iron supplements without first having ferritin levels tested, as many people with RLS do not have low ferritin and taking iron when it is not called for is unlikely to offer any therapeutic benefit whilst still able to cause adverse events. All parenteral iron treatments require diagnosis with laboratory tests to avoid iron overload.",

The function and structure of the expressed ferritin protein varies in different cell types. This is controlled primarily by the amount and stability of Messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA concentration is further tweaked by changes to how it is stored and how efficiently it is transcribed.
