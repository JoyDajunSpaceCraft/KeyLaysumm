An example of this is found in a study published in Nature, which showed that mice with a latent infection of a Herpesvirus were less susceptible to bacterial infections. Mice were infected with murine gammherpesvirus 68 (a member of the gammaherpesvirinae subfamily) and then challenged with \"Listeria monocytogenes\". The mice that had a latent infection of the virus had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria. The study went on to test mice with murine cytomegalovirus, a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which provided similar results. However, infection with human herpes simplex virus type-1, a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, did not provide increased resistance to bacterial infection. They also used \"Yersinia pestis\" (the causative agent of the Black Death) to challenge mice with a latent infection of gammaherpesvirus 68, and they found the mice did have an increased resistance to the bacteria. The suspected reason for this is that peritoneal macrophages in the mouse are activated after latent infection of the herpesvirus, and since macrophages play an important role in immunity, this provides the mouse with a stronger, active immune system at the time of bacterial exposure. It was found that the latent herpesvirus caused an increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), both of which lead to activation of macrophages and resistance to bacterial infection.",

Bacterial leaf streak of wheat is a seed-borne disease and is primarily transported by seed, but can also be transmitted by plant-to-plant contact within its lifecycle. Epidemics are typically observed late in the growing season and in wet environments.  Moisture facilitates the release of the pathogen from the inoculated seed, which leads to leaf colonization and invasion of tissue. Bacteria on the moist leaf surface enter through leaf openings, such as the stomata or wounds. Under moderately warm weather conditions (15-30 degrees Celsius) bacteria will begin to release and multiply in the plant parenchyma tissue. The bacteria then inject a number of effector proteins into the plant with a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS). The T3SS effectors in Xanthomonas are Transcription Activator-like effectors (TAL effectors). These TAL effectors activate the production of plant genes that are beneficial to bacterial infection. The bacteria spreads and progresses vertically up the plant. The bacterial masses cause elongated streaks along the veins of the plant.  Water collection on leaves also leads to the spread of the organism, increasing the number of lesions on leaves. Rain, wind, insects, and plant-to-plant contact may spread the disease in the season and cause reinfection.  After the plant is harvested or dies, the bacteria may overwinter in the soil; although, its survival rate is much greater when crop debris is present. However, the bacteria cannot survive on decomposing matter alone and free bacteria cannot survive for more than 14 days in hot dry weather. Bacteria is primarily spread by infected or contaminated seed. In some cases, the bacterial will overwinter on other perennial plants and weeds. Residual bacteria in the soil, debris or other plants may also cause new infection in clean seed.",

About 80% of natural and cultivated plants harbour AM fungi. These interactions increase nutrient availability in the plant and lead to increased plant growth and environmental stress-resistance. There exists a current demand in agriculture to cultivate and optimize to increase yield sustainably. Without considering the bacteria that live within AM fungi, like Ca. G. sporarum, as a factor that may contribute the beneficial nature of AM fungi to plants, we may overlook what makes widespread agricultural application possible.

Symptoms of bacterial panicle blight include seedling blighting and sheath rot in addition to panicle blighting, which accounts for most of the damage from this disease. Affected panicles have blighted florets, which initially show white or light gray on the basal third with a dark-brown margin and eventually become straw-colored. The florets then turn dark with growth of fungi or bacteria on the surface. Extensive occurrence of upright panicles because of the failure of grain-filling and seed development is a typical phenomenon observed in a severely infested field. Prolonged high temperature during the growing season is an important environmental condition that promotes the development of bacterial panicle blight.  Severe epidemics of this disease, which caused up to 40 percent yield losses in some fields, occurred during the 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000 and, most recently, 2010 growing seasons, when record-high night temperatures were experienced. Suspected global warming could make bacterial panicle blight a greater threat to rice production in the future. Indeed, occurrence of bacterial panicle blight is increasing not only in the southern United States but in other rice growing countries of Central and South America and Asia. <br>The disease cycle of bacterial panicle blight is not fully understood in spite of the economic importance of the disease. <br>The bacterial pathogens are considered to be seed-borne, but they also survive in the soil. After germination of the seed, the bacteria appear to survive on the leaves and sheath and spread upward as the plant grows. Their infection to rice panicles occurs at flowering, if the bacterial population reaches to a threshold level and environmental condition is favorable. They may also be disseminated from severely diseased panicles to neighboring healthy plants, according to the observed spatial distribution patterns of the disease in infested rice fields. However, it is not clear if long-distance dissemination can occur via insect transmission. Unfortunately, there are few effective control measures for this disease so far. Less nitrogen fertilization reduces disease severity but has not been successful. High temperatures at the vulnerable period can be avoided by early planting, but this cultural practice would become useless if hot weather comes early in the growing season. No pesticides are currently recommended or allowed for controlling this disease in the United States. Copper compounds are weakly effective but sometimes toxic to the plant. Oxolinic acid is useful for seed treatment, and its foliar spray is effective on infected plants, but this chemical is not commercially available in the United States. <br>The research goal on bacterial panicle blight is to develop effective disease control methods based on better understanding of the bacterial virulence mechanism and the rice defense system. To achieve this goal, LSU AgCenter scientists are conducting several different areas of research. First, scientists are making efforts to develop new rice varieties and lines resistant to bacterial panicle blight through conventional breeding and line development processes. More than 15,000 lines are evaluated annually to select promising lines showing high levels of disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight and other good agronomic traits. The partial-resistant rice varieties and lines, such as Jupiter and LM-1, were developed from this program. Second, scientists are conducting genetic and molecular biological studies on the rice disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight. Genetic mapping to identify the rice genes associated with the disease resistance is under way. In addition, the induction of a rice defense system by pretreatment of various chemical materials, which leads to enhanced disease resistance, is being studied. Finally, scientists are studying molecular genetics and genomics of the major pathogen, B. glumae, to understand the mechanism underlying its bacterial pathogenesis in rice. Genetic elements governing the production of virulence factors are being identified and characterized.",

Both protozoan grazing and viral infection balance the major fraction of bacterial growth. In addition, the microbial loop dominates in oligotrophic waters, rather than in eutrophic areas - there the classical plankton food chain predominates, due to the frequent fresh supply of mineral nutrients (e.g. spring bloom in temperate waters, upwelling areas).

The cells do not reproduce in synchrony without explicit and continual prompting (as in experiments with stalked bacteria ) and their exponential phase growth is often not ever a constant rate, but instead a slowly decaying rate, a constant stochastic response to pressures both to reproduce and to go dormant in the face of declining nutrient concentrations and increasing waste concentrations.",

On the contrary, although WT cells do not achieve such high population densities, their populations are sustainable at the same density in the long term. As predicted by theory, in a spatial setting such as those implemented experimentally by microfluidics chips, coexistence between the two strains is possible due to the localization of interactions and the spatial segregation of cheaters.

The transfer of bacterial DNA is under the control of the bacteriophage\u2019s genes rather than bacterial genes. Conjugation in the well-studied \"E. coli\" system is controlled by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for distributing copies of a plasmid from one bacterial host to another. Infrequently during this process, a plasmid may integrate into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfer part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.

Pre-planting dissemination occurs when the stems of Carnation flowers from the infected host are cut and placed in a water bed with healthy plants, before they are individually planted (the bacteria slowly spreads from one cutting to the next via free water). Because of the possibility of transmission during the latent period, cuttings require cautious cultural measures. Post-planting dissemination may occur from one root system to the next via an existing canker in the infected plant. When the canker, which contains accumulated yellowish-brown bacterial slime, oozes out via an opening, the bacteria is released to the surrounding soil. \"B. caryophylli\" cannot travel long distances, and therefore, only infects neighboring plant roots systems.

Epidemics are typically observed late in the growing season and in wet environments.

Bacteria on the moist leaf surface enter through leaf openings, such as the stomata or wounds. Under moderately warm weather conditions (15-30 degrees Celsius) bacteria will begin to release and multiply in the plant parenchyma tissue. The bacteria then inject a number of effector proteins into the plant with a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS). The T3SS effectors in Xanthomonas are Transcription Activator-like effectors (TAL effectors). These TAL effectors activate the production of plant genes that are beneficial to bacterial infection. The bacteria spreads and progresses vertically up the plant. The bacterial masses cause elongated streaks along the veins of the plant.  Water collection on leaves also leads to the spread of the organism, increasing the number of lesions on leaves. Rain, wind, insects, and plant-to-plant contact may spread the disease in the season and cause reinfection.

There exists a current demand in agriculture to cultivate and optimize to increase yield sustainably. Without considering the bacteria that live within AM fungi, like Ca.

First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called transformation. Many bacteria can naturally take up DNA from the environment, while others must be chemically altered in order to induce them to take up DNA. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells. The second way bacteria transfer genetic material is by transduction, when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome. Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and lyse their host bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteria resist phage infection through restriction modification systems that degrade foreign DNA, and a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. The third method of gene transfer is conjugation, whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact. In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions.",

The mice that had a latent infection of the virus had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria.

The suspected reason for this is that peritoneal macrophages in the mouse are activated after latent infection of the herpesvirus, and since macrophages play an important role in immunity, this provides the mouse with a stronger, active immune system at the time of bacterial exposure. It was found that the latent herpesvirus caused an increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), both of which lead to activation of macrophages and resistance to bacterial infection.",

Both protozoan grazing and viral infection balance the major fraction of bacterial growth. In addition, the microbial loop dominates in oligotrophic waters, rather than in eutrophic areas - there the classical plankton food chain predominates, due to the frequent fresh supply of mineral nutrients (e.g. spring bloom in temperate waters, upwelling areas).

The disease is caused by the bacterial species \"Xanthomonas translucens\" pv. undulosa. The pathogen is found globally, but is a primary problem in the US in the lower mid-south and can reduce yields by up to 40 percent. BLS is primarily seed-borne (the disease is transmitted by seed) and survives in and on the seed, but may also survive in crop residue in the soil in the off-season. During the growing season, the bacteria may transfer from plant to plant by contact, but it is primarily spread by rain, wind and insect contact. The bacteria thrives in moist environments, and produces a cream to yellow bacterial ooze, which, when dry, appears light colored and scale-like, resulting in a streak on the leaves. The invasion of the head of wheat causes bands of necrotic tissue on the awns, which is called Black Chaff. The disease is not easily managed, as there are no pesticides on the market for treatment of the infection. There are some resistant cultivars available, but no seed treatment exists. Some integrated pest management (IPM) techniques may be used to assist with preventing infection although, none will completely prevent the disease.",

Bacteriophages and their host ranges are extremely specific for certain bacteria, thus they do not disturb the host organism and intestinal microflora unlike antibiotics. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, infect and can kill bacteria and affect bacterial growth primarily during lytic cycles. Phages insert their DNA into the bacterium, where it is transcribed and used to make new phages, after which the cell will lyse, releasing new phage able to infect and destroy further bacteria of the same strain. The high specificity of phage protects \"good\" bacteria from destruction. However, some disadvantages to use of bacteriophages also exist. Bacteriophages may harbour virulence factors or toxic genes in their genomes and identification of genes with similarity to known virulence factors or toxins by genomic sequencing may be prudent prior to use. In addition, the oral and IV administration of phages for the eradication of bacterial infections poses a much higher safety risk than topical application, and there is the additional concern of uncertain immune responses to these large antigenic cocktails. There are considerable regulatory hurdles that must be cleared for such therapies. The use of bacteriophages as a replacement for antimicrobial agents against MDR pathogens no longer respond to conventional antibiotics remains an attractive option despite numerous challenges.",

The successful dissemination of the bacterial infection can occur Pre and post-planting. Pre-planting dissemination occurs when the stems of Carnation flowers from the infected host are cut and placed in a water bed with healthy plants, before they are individually planted (the bacteria slowly spreads from one cutting to the next via free water). Because of the possibility of transmission during the latent period, cuttings require cautious cultural measures. Post-planting dissemination may occur from one root system to the next via an existing canker in the infected plant. When the canker, which contains accumulated yellowish-brown bacterial slime, oozes out via an opening, the bacteria is released to the surrounding soil. \"B. caryophylli\" cannot travel long distances, and therefore, only infects neighboring plant roots systems. As the root system absorbs the nutrient and water from the soil, it also absorbs the soil-borne bacteria in the soil. Once inside the host, the bacterium aggregates towards the vascular system, finding its way to the phloem. It also blocks the xylem, cutting off the water circulation of the plant. Eventually, the roots are no longer able to anchor properly onto the soil. As the host plant wilts and dies, the bacteria overwinters in the host debris and soil.",

As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is made up of a polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating N-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) residues in equal amounts. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. extracellular parasites such as \"Mycoplasma\") contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. Since the cell wall is required for bacterial survival, but is absent in some eukaryotes, several antibiotics (notably the penicillins and cephalosporins) stop bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis, while having no effects on human cells which have no cell wall only a cell membrane. There are two main types of bacterial cell walls, those of gram-positive bacteria and those of gram-negative bacteria, which are differentiated by their Gram staining characteristics. For both these types of bacteria, particles of approximately 2\u00a0nm can pass through the peptidoglycan. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast while if it's partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. \"\u03b2\"-Lactam antibiotics such as penicillin inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall.

This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene.

Symptoms of bacterial panicle blight include seedling blighting and sheath rot in addition to panicle blighting, which accounts for most of the damage from this disease. Affected panicles have blighted florets, which initially show white or light gray on the basal third with a dark-brown margin and eventually become straw-colored. The florets then turn dark with growth of fungi or bacteria on the surface. Extensive occurrence of upright panicles because of the failure of grain-filling and seed development is a typical phenomenon observed in a severely infested field. Prolonged high temperature during the growing season is an important environmental condition that promotes the development of bacterial panicle blight.  Severe epidemics of this disease, which caused up to 40 percent yield losses in some fields, occurred during the 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000 and, most recently, 2010 growing seasons, when record-high night temperatures were experienced. Suspected global warming could make bacterial panicle blight a greater threat to rice production in the future. Indeed, occurrence of bacterial panicle blight is increasing not only in the southern United States but in other rice growing countries of Central and South America and Asia. <br>The disease cycle of bacterial panicle blight is not fully understood in spite of the economic importance of the disease. <br>The bacterial pathogens are considered to be seed-borne, but they also survive in the soil. After germination of the seed, the bacteria appear to survive on the leaves and sheath and spread upward as the plant grows. Their infection to rice panicles occurs at flowering, if the bacterial population reaches to a threshold level and environmental condition is favorable. They may also be disseminated from severely diseased panicles to neighboring healthy plants, according to the observed spatial distribution patterns of the disease in infested rice fields. However, it is not clear if long-distance dissemination can occur via insect transmission. Unfortunately, there are few effective control measures for this disease so far. Less nitrogen fertilization reduces disease severity but has not been successful. High temperatures at the vulnerable period can be avoided by early planting, but this cultural practice would become useless if hot weather comes early in the growing season. No pesticides are currently recommended or allowed for controlling this disease in the United States. Copper compounds are weakly effective but sometimes toxic to the plant. Oxolinic acid is useful for seed treatment, and its foliar spray is effective on infected plants, but this chemical is not commercially available in the United States. <br>The research goal on bacterial panicle blight is to develop effective disease control methods based on better understanding of the bacterial virulence mechanism and the rice defense system. To achieve this goal, LSU AgCenter scientists are conducting several different areas of research. First, scientists are making efforts to develop new rice varieties and lines resistant to bacterial panicle blight through conventional breeding and line development processes. More than 15,000 lines are evaluated annually to select promising lines showing high levels of disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight and other good agronomic traits. The partial-resistant rice varieties and lines, such as Jupiter and LM-1, were developed from this program. Second, scientists are conducting genetic and molecular biological studies on the rice disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight. Genetic mapping to identify the rice genes associated with the disease resistance is under way. In addition, the induction of a rice defense system by pretreatment of various chemical materials, which leads to enhanced disease resistance, is being studied. Finally, scientists are studying molecular genetics and genomics of the major pathogen, B. glumae, to understand the mechanism underlying its bacterial pathogenesis in rice. Genetic elements governing the production of virulence factors are being identified and characterized.",
