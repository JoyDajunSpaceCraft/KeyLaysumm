            "document": "Bacterial morphological plasticity . For \"Burkholderia pseudomallei\", some clinical antibiotic agents that are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some \u03b2-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the \"minimal inhibitory concentration\" (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. However, the \"B.pseudomallei\" filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. Furthermore, for \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\", filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (\"lipopolysaccharide, LPS\") release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol. The molecular correlate of the filament formation was described. The exposure to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics induced the SOS response in \"Escherichia coli\". During repair of DNA damage, the SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division. Moreover, both \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and genetic mutation induce SOS in \"E.coli\" through the DpiBA \"two-component signal transduction system\" leading to the inactivation of the ftsl gene product, penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP-3). The ftsl gene is a group of filamentous temperature-sensitive genes implicated in cell division. In addition, it is a membrane transpeptidase required for peptidoglycan synthesis at the septum generated by cell division. The event to inactivate ftsl gene product requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA and transiently inhibits bacterial cell division. Consequently, the bactericidal effects of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are limited. The DpiA is the effector for the DpiB two-component system. Interaction of DpiA with replication origins competes with the binding of the replication proteins DnaA and DnaB. When overexpressed, DpiA can interrupt DNA replication and induce the SOS response resulting in inhibition of cell division.",

            "document": "Snake venom . The toxicity of snake venom is assessed by a toxicological test called the median lethal dose, LD, (an abbreviation for \"lethal dose, 50%\"), which determines the concentration of a toxin required to kill half the members of a tested population of animals. The potency of the venom of wild snakes varies considerably, even within any single species. This is because of assorted influences such as biophysical environment, physiological status, ecological variables, genetic variation (either adaptive or incidental) and various other molecular- and ecological evolutionary factors. Such variation necessarily is smaller in captive populations in controlled laboratory settings though it cannot be eliminated altogether. However, studies to determine snake venom lethality or potency need to be designed to minimise variability and several techniques have been designed to this end. One approach that is considered particularly helpful is to use 0.1% bovine serum albumin (also known as \"Fraction V\" in Cohn process) as a diluent in determining LD values for various species. It results in far more accurate and consistent median lethal dose (LD) determinations than for example using 0.1% saline as a diluent. Fraction V produces about 95% purified albumin, which is the dried crude venom. Saline as a diluent consistently produces widely varying LD results for nearly all venomous snakes; it produces unpredictable variation in the purity of the precipitate (range from 35-60%). Fraction V is structurally stable because it has seventeen disulfide bonds; it is unique in that it has the highest solubility and lowest isoelectric point of all the major plasma proteins. This makes it the final fraction to be precipitated from its solution. Bovine serum albumin is located in fraction V. The precipitation of albumin is done by reducing the pH to 4.8, which is near the pI of the proteins, and maintaining the ethanol concentration to be 40%, with a protein concentration of 1%. Thus, only 1% of the original plasma remains in the fifth fraction. When the ultimate goal of plasma processing is a purified plasma component for injection or transfusion, the plasma component must be highly pure. The first practical large-scale method of blood plasma fractionation was developed by Edwin J. Cohn during World War II. It is known as the Cohn process (or Cohn method). This process is also known as cold ethanol fractionation as it involves gradually increasing the concentration of ethanol in the solution at 5C and 3C. The Cohn Process exploits differences in properties of the various plasma proteins, specifically, the high solubility and low pI of albumin. As the ethanol concentration is increased in stages from 0% to 40% the [pH] is lowered from neutral (pH ~ 7) to about 4.8, which is near the pI of albumin. At each stage certain proteins are precipitated out of the solution and removed. The final precipitate is purified albumin. Several variations to this process exist, including an adapted method by Nitschmann and Kistler that uses less steps, and replaces centrifugation and bulk freezing with filtration and diafiltration. Some newer methods of albumin purification add additional purification steps to the Cohn Process and its variations. Chromatographic albumin processing as an alternative to the Cohn Process emerged in the early 1980s, however, it was not widely adopted until later due to the inadequate availability of large scale chromatography equipment. Methods incorporating chromatography generally begin with cryo-depleted plasma undergoing buffer exchange via either diafiltration or buffer exchange chromatography, to prepare the plasma for following ion exchange chromatography steps. After ion exchange there are generally further chromatographic purification steps and buffer exchange.",

Self-activating prey, where the randomized region facilitate reporter expression in the absence of TF binding, are removed by transforming the reporter vector library into bacteria in the absence of bait and assaying for growth on plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA). The protein product of URA3 converts 5-FOA into a toxic compound, thereby allowing survival of only those colonies that contain reporter vectors which are not self-activating. Negative selection normally precedes positive selection so that a smaller, purified prey library can be subjected to the more rigorous positive selection process. Upon transformation of the purified prey library with the bait plasmid, positive selection is achieved by growing the host E. coli on minimal medium lacking histidine (NM selective medium) that is usually supplemented with varying concentrations of 3-amino-triazole (3-AT), a competitive inhibitor of HIS3.

Manipulating 3-AT concentrations allows for the characterization of binding stringencies. In this way, researches can gauge how strongly bait binds its prey (correlated with the level of expression of HIS3) and thus determines which nucleotide binding-sites have strong or weak preferences for a given base. In other words, if cells can grow despite a high concentration of 3-AT, bait-prey binding must be of high enough stringency to drive reporter gene expression (HIS3) at a sufficient level to overcome the resulting competitive inhibition. Finally, positive clones are sequenced and examined with preexisting motif-finding tools (ex, MEME, BioProspector).",

Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and blood-oxygen levels are adaptive as Darwinian fitness. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two alleles for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality. In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequences of 50 Tibetans and 40 Han Chinese from Beijing. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (\"EPAS1\"). It was found that one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at \"EPAS1\" shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of phenotypically observable evolution in humans, which is estimated to occur in less than 3,000 years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population. Mutations in \"EPAS1\", at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (\"EGLN1\") (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (\"PPARA\"), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.",

The strains have been altered with a mutation in a gene important for histidine production, so they require histidine for growth. The cells are grown on a histidine rich medium and are then transferred to a medium that lacks histidine and contains the potential mutagenic substance. If the mutagenic substance causes mutations, there is a very small chance that another mutation occurs in the histidine gene which again enables the production of histidine. These cells are then able to grow on the medium lacking histidine. The mutagenicity of a compound is calculated by the number of yeast colonies which are reverted to the histidine-independent form. In one study, the Ames test was executed with benzo[\"c\"]fluorene. Two different strains were used, TA100 and TA98. One group of each strain had a rat liver fraction and one group did not. The difference between the TA100 and the TA98 strain is that the TA98 strain has a frameshift mutation, and the TA100 has a base substitution mutation. When the amount of benzo[\"c\"]fluorene is increased in TA 100 yeast strain, the amount of revertants per plate does not increase. Only in the TA98 strain plate, which contained a fraction of a rat liver, a higher dose of benzo[\"c\"]fluorene seems to correspond with a larger amount of revertants. This indicates that benzo[\"c\"]fluorene is metabolized by enzymes in the rat liver into more potent mutagenic compounds. These compounds only affected the TA98 strain.

It has been proposed that endospore formation has allowed for the survival of some bacteria for hundreds of millions of years (e.g. in salt crystals) although these publications have been questioned. Endospore formation is limited to several genera of gram-positive bacteria such as \"Bacillus\" and \"Clostridium\".

Furthermore, 14 studies showed that DCA and LCA induce DNA damage in colon cells. Also 27 studies reported that bile acids cause programmed cell death (apoptosis). Increased apoptosis can result in selective survival of cells that are resistant to induction of apoptosis. Colon cells with reduced ability to undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage would tend to accumulate mutations, and such cells may give rise to colon cancer. Epidemiologic studies have found that fecal bile acid concentrations are increased in populations with a high incidence of colon cancer. Dietary increases in total fat or saturated fat result in elevated DCA and LCA in feces and elevated exposure of the colon epithelium to these bile acids. When the bile acid DCA was added to the standard diet of wild-type mice invasive colon cancer was induced in 56% of the mice after 8 to 10 months.

A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces. The excretion and reabsorption of bile acids forms the basis of the enterohepatic circulation, which is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. Under certain circumstances, when more concentrated, as in the gallbladder, cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstones (lecithin and bilirubin gallstones also occur, but less frequently). Every day, up to 1 g of cholesterol enters the colon. This cholesterol originates from the diet, bile, and desquamated intestinal cells, and can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria. Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol, a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces. A cholesterol-reducing bacterium origin has been isolated from human feces.",

The glucuronidation of the drug in the kidney also facilitates bile excretion. Substances with similar physicochemical properties can block the receptor, which is important in assessing interactions.

Bile acids have powerful toxic properties like membrane disruption and there are a wide range of mechanisms to restrict their accumulation in tissues and blood. The discovery of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) which is located in the liver, has opened new insights. Bile acid activation of FXR represses the expression of CYP7A1 via, raising the expression of small heterodimer (SHP), a non-DNA binding protein.The increased abundance of SHP causes it to associate with liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1, an obligate factor required for the transcription of CYP7A1. Furthermore, there is an \"FXR/SHP-independent\" mechanism that also represses CYP7A1 expression. This \"FXR/SHP-independent\" pathway involves the interaction of bile acids with liver macrophages, which finally induces the expression and secretion of cytokines. These inflammatory cytokines, which include tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta, act upon the liver parenchymal cells causing a rapid repression of the CYP7A1 gene.",
