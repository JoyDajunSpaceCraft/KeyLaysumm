A gametocyte in Plasmodium Falciparum is a cell specializing in the transition between the human and the mosquito host. Gametocytes arise from erythrocytic asexual stages. The production of gametocytes directly from hepatic merozoites, which has been described in other species, does not occur in P. falciparum. Gametocytes are capable of inducing specific humoral IgG, and cellular responses, which include induction of TNFa (protein coding), IFNg(gene protein coding) and gd+ lymphocyte proliferation, in addition to immune responses to other stages of the parasite. There has been much debate on the actual point of sexual differentiation and many people have shown that merozoites emerging from a single schizont developed either into further asexual stages or into gametocytes. It has been further shown that the gametocytes from one schizont are all male or all female. This suggests that the trophozoites of the preceding asexual generation were already committed to either sexual development or continuing asexual cycling. In order to adjust to life in such drastically different environments, many changes occur in its cell biology, metabolism, gene expression and protein synthesis. Gametocytes of P. falciparum have been shown to exhibit a different pattern of gene expression than asexual stages, which is unsurprising if one were to consider the difference between these two stages. Transcription and translation levels are not constant during gametocytogenesis: this was shown in drug sensitivity studies where RNA and protein synthesis levels were much more important in the early than the late gametocyte stages. Furthermore, a sex-specific expression has also been discovered, with differences in RNA, mitochondria and ribosome content. The female is preparing for a continued development, and the male is terminally differentiated and only needs what is necessary for exflagellation ( cell division cycle, dynein and \u03b1-tubulin II). Plasmodium falciparum is both the most deadly and most researched species of malaria. The majority of the research conducted is to find a vaccine or treatment for the disease. Some believe that due to the ineffectiveness of the past, any vaccine found will most likely not become completely effective. Others remain hopeful citing the fact that the species complex life cycle offers numerous options for vaccines and treatments, as well as the proof that partial immunity does occur in endemic areas in some people. Mature macrogamtocytes are female and mature microgametocytes are male. In P. falciparum, gametocytes are produced from asexual stages. All the gametocytes produced from one sexually committed schizont are of the same sex, suggesting that sex is determined at the very beginning of sexual development. However, gametocyte sex can only be microscopically differentiated from stage III and onward. They are crescent- or sausage- shaped.",

In most species a male and female sex exist, both of which are optimized for reproductive potential. Due to their differently sized and shaped gametes, both males and females have developed physiological and behavioral differences that optimize the individual\u2019s fecundity. Since most egg laying females typically must bear the offspring and have a more limited reproductive cycle, this typically makes females a limiting factor in the reproductive success rate of males in a species. This process is also true for females selecting males, and assuming that males and females are selecting for different traits in partners, would result in phenotypic differences between the sexes over many generations. This hypothesis, known as the Bateman\u2019s Principle, is used to understand the evolutionary pressures put on males and females due to anisogamy. Although this assumption has criticism, it is a generally accepted model for sexual selection within anisogamous species. The selection for different traits depending on sex within the same species is known as sex-specific selection, and accounts for the differing phenotypes found between the sexes of the same species. This sex-specific selection between sexes over time also lead to the development of secondary sex characteristics, which assist males and females in reproductive success.",

After the discovery of the testis-determining gene SRY, many scientists shifted to the theory that the genetic mechanism that causes a fetus to develop into a male form was initiated by the SRY gene, which was thought to be responsible for the production of testosterone and its overall effects on body and brain development. This perspective still shares the classical way of thinking; that in order to produce two sexes, nature has developed a default female pathway and an active pathway by which male genes would initiate the process of determining a male sex, as something that is developed in addition to and based on the default female form. However, In an interview for the \"Rediscovering Biology\" website, researcher Eric Vilain described how the paradigm changed since the discovery of the SRY gene: In mammals, including humans, the SRY gene is responsible with triggering the development of non-differentiated gonads into testes, rather than ovaries. However, there are cases in which testes can develop in the absence of an SRY gene (see sex reversal). In these cases, the SOX9 gene, involved in the development of testes, can induce their development without the aid of SRY. In the absence of SRY and SOX9, no testes can develop and the path is clear for the development of ovaries. Even so, the absence of the SRY gene or the silencing of the SOX9 gene are not enough to trigger sexual differentiation of a fetus in the female direction. A recent finding suggests that ovary development and maintenance is an active process, regulated by the expression of a \"pro-female\" gene, FOXL2. In an interview for the \"TimesOnline\" edition, study co-author Robin Lovell-Badge explained the significance of the discovery: Looking into the genetic determinants of human sex can have wide-ranging consequences. Scientists have been studying different sex determination systems in fruit flies and animal models to attempt an understanding of how the genetics of sexual differentiation can influence biological processes like reproduction, ageing and disease.",

Sexual bimaturism can result in sexual dimorphism, but sexual dimorphism could also develop through differential rates of development.

Male simian primates are generally larger than females of the same species due in part to extended growth periods. Gorillas demonstrate a particularly high degree of sexual bimaturism. Bimaturism can refer to developmental differences within a sex related to secondary sex characteristics. For example, male orangutans reach sexual maturity around age 15 but undergo an additional period of development later in life before they exhibit cheek flanges. Flanged males are generally preferred by females so that unflanged males need different mating strategies to compete with flanged males.  The onset of this second developmental phase varies greatly and may be influenced by the proximity of other flanged males. In humans, sexual bimaturism is evident in that males begin puberty later than females. This may be related to selection for later maturation in males in a polygynous mating system.",

Dreissena polymorpha, a small freshwater mussel, is the first intermediate host parasitized by the hatching miracidium. Within the visceral mass of Dreissena, the miracidium transforms into a mother (primary) sporocyst. Asexual reproduction produces many daughter (secondary) sporocysts which are called cecariacysts, that eventually release cercariae. Unlike most digenetic trematodes, Bucephalus Polymorphus lacks a redial stage and thus emerges as a cecaria directly from the sporocyst stage. Rapid proliferation of sporocysts results in a knotted white mass of tubules, which is found primarily in the gonads of the mussel. Released from the infected mussels, cercariae attach to fish (second intermediate host), encyst, and transforms into metacercariae. The third (definitive) hosts are predatory fish that consume the infected foraging fish. It has been shown experimentally that cercarial emergence exhibits a circadian rhythm of shedding with a peak in the dark period of a light:dark 12:12 h photoperiod. \"Bucephalus polymorphus\" is a parasite residing exclusively in host connective tissues. The gonads of its first intermediate host, \"Dreissena\", is the primary target of infection and sporocyst proliferation. As infection intensifies, the sporocyst develops branches through connective tissue passages, emerges from the gonads, and can spread into other body regions. Such secondary sites of infection have been previously reported to occur in the digestive glands, the gills, the bundles of adductor muscle, and the mantle epithelium lining the interior of the shells. The study found that the digestive glands of infected bivalves appeared to be relatively normal when compared to full bodied, uninfected specimens. Within the sporocyst, the cercariae existed within a wide range of developmental stages, indicating that its development is asynchronous. It was also observed that heavy infection of the parasite led to host castration, which left the entire gonadal space often occupied by the sporocysts. By limiting the infection almost exclusively to the gonads, the parasites have developed an interesting strategy to only use the reproductive energy of their hosts, thereby minimizing the risk of host mortality. Extending the life of a bucephalus infected host is important because this allows the parasite to proliferate continuously from year to year, since infected gonads produce cercariae instead of gametes. The location of the sporocyst (primarily in gonads), its overall shape, irregular branches, and the morphology of its cercariae with a bifurcated tail, distinguish \"B. polymorphus\" from other trematode parasites of zebra mussels in histological sections.",

One paper, published in \"Evolution\", evaluates the hypothesis that sex-limited traits can arise in two ways. The alleles responsible for sexual dimorphism can be limited to expression in only one sex when they first appear, or the alleles could begin by being expressed in both sexes then become modified (repressed or promoted) in one sex by modifier genes or regulatory elements. The concept of this study was to examine female hybrids from species where males displayed different types of ornamental traits (elongated feathers, wattles, color patches). The assumption is that different hypotheses about male-specific expression will yield different results in female hybrids. The methods and materials of the experiment are discussed in detail in the paper, but the important result that emerged was that NO female hybrids expressed any of the ornamental traits found in the parent males. Two interpretations of these results are possible: the dimorphic alleles were initially only expressed in males, or the alleles were initially expressed in both and then were suppressed in females or became limited to males by regulatory regions that are \"completely dominant\" in hybrids. The most likely genomic explanation for initial expression in both species then modification is involvement of \"cis\"-dominance, where the factors that modify the gene are located next to the gene on the chromosome. (This is in contrast to \"trans\"-dominance, where mobile products that can affect distant genes are produced.) These factors can be in the form of promoter regions, which can be either be suppressed or activated by hormones. This experiment also demonstrates that these alleles come under regulatory control very quickly. This is because none of the ornamentation seen in males is seen in the \"very next \"generation. These conclusions make it likely that at least some male-specific (thus, sex-limited) genes cue their expression by hormone levels - the absence of estrogen or the presence of testosterone.",

The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) that consists of maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach \"Blaptica dubia\", as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, such as those in the genus of cockroaches known as \"Diploptera\", are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be \"univoltine\", \"bivoltine\" or \"multivoltine\", i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year. Other developmental and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, which is a type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is typical in bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different \"morphs\" or \"forms\", as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth \"Orgyia recens\" as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects.",

            "document": "Vinclozolin . As part of the reregistration process, the U.S. EPA reviewed all toxicity studies on vinclozolin. The main effect induced by vinclozolin is related to its antiandrogenic activity and its ability to act as a competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor. Vinclozolin can mimic male hormones, like testosterone, and bind to androgen receptors, while not necessarily activating those receptors properly. There is evidence that vinclozolin itself binds weakly to the androgen receptor but that at least two of its metabolites are responsible for much of the antiandrogenic activity. When male rats were given low dose levels (>3\u00a0mg/kg/day) of vinclozolin, effects such as decreased prostate weight, weight reduction in sex organs, nipple development, and decreased ano-genital distance were noted. At higher dose levels, male sex organ weight decreased further, and sex organ malformations were seen, such as reduced penis size, the appearance of vaginal pouches and hypospadias. In the rat model, it has been shown that the antiandorgenic effects of vinclozolin are most prominent during the developmental stages. In utero, this sensitive period of fetal development occurs between gestation days 16-17. Embryonic exposure to vinclozolin can influence sexual differentiation, gonadal formation, and reproductive functions. In bird models, vinclozolin and its metabolites were shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit androgen receptor binding and gene expression. Vinclozolin caused reduced egg laying, reduced fertility rate, and a reduction in successful hatches. Androgens also play a role in puberty, and it has been shown an antiandrogen like vinclozolin can delay pubertal maturation. Antiandrogenic toxins are also known to alter sexual differentiation and reproduction in the rabbit model. Male rabbits exposed to vinclozolin in utero or during infancy did not show a sexual interest in females or did not ejaculate. Since the androgen receptor is widely conserved across species lines, antiandrogenic effects would be expected in humans. In vertebrates, vinclozolin also acts as a neuroendocrine disruptor, affecting behaviors tied to locomotion, cognition, and anxiety.",

Intersexual competition refers to the sexes feeding on different resources in order to reduce the competition within the species, while differential equilibrium refers to the different body sizes as a result of the opposing strategies of each sex to increase fitness. Females tend to lay more eggs and invest more time in those specific eggs directly opposing males who in order to increase their own fitness, spend less time on a specific group of eggs, and attempt to fertilise as many eggs as possible. The differential equilibrium hypothesis is well supported; however it cannot be deemed the clear answer because not enough experiments have tested intersexual competition. One problem with comparing these two different hypotheses comes from the chance that dimorphic niches may have evolved from something in the past that is no longer present today, also known as \"ghost of competition past\" by Connell. Information was collected from 3 main databases, which spanned 1503 species of Oriental and African Orthoptera, to determine females were larger in the majority of the 99.6% of the species. Another hypothesis was that perhaps the temperature controlled the growth of Orthoptera, which would be in accordance with previous data that \"Omocestus viridulus\" had the additional instar stage in only low altitude areas of the Alps.

Females have two X chromosomes. The Y chromosome is what determines sexual differentiation. If the Y chromosome is present, growth is along male lines. The SRY is a specific part of the Y chromosome which is the sex-determining gene region of the chromosome. This is what is responsible for the differentiation between male and females.  Testosterone helps differentiate gender by increasing the likelihood of male patterns of behavior. It has effects on the central nervous system that trigger these behaviors. Parts of the SRY and specific parts of the Y chromosome could also possibly influence different gender behaviors. The biological approach states that the distinction between men and women are due to inherent and hormonal differences. Some critique this approach because it leaves little room for sexual expression and gender because it claims both are dependent on biological makeup. Biological explanations of gender and sexual differences have been correlated to the work done by Charles Darwin regarding evolution. He suggested that just as wild animals and plants had physiological differences between sexes, humans did as well. Biological perspectives on psychological differentiation often place parallels to the physical nature of sexual differentiation. These parallels include genetic and hormonal factors that create different individuals, with the main difference being the reproductive function. The brain controls behavior by individuals, but it is influenced by genes, hormones and evolution. Evidence has shown that the ways boys and girls become men and women is different, and that there are variations between the individuals of each sex. There have been studies conducted to try and associate hormones with the gender identity of males and females. Okayama University in Japan did a study investigating the biological nature of gender identity disorder. The researchers looked at five different sex related hormones and whether or not they increased the chances of an individual being a transsexual. They examined male to female (MTF) and female to male (FTM) transsexuals, using control males and females for comparison. Their research did not find a significant difference in the distribution of the examined genes. The results currently can not provide evidence that the different genetic variants of sex hormone genes influence an individual to MTF or FTM transsexualism.",

A gametocyte in Plasmodium Falciparum is a cell specializing in the transition between the human and the mosquito host. Gametocytes arise from erythrocytic asexual stages. The production of gametocytes directly from hepatic merozoites, which has been described in other species, does not occur in P. falciparum. Gametocytes are capable of inducing specific humoral IgG, and cellular responses, which include induction of TNFa (protein coding), IFNg(gene protein coding) and gd+ lymphocyte proliferation, in addition to immune responses to other stages of the parasite. There has been much debate on the actual point of sexual differentiation and many people have shown that merozoites emerging from a single schizont developed either into further asexual stages or into gametocytes. It has been further shown that the gametocytes from one schizont are all male or all female. This suggests that the trophozoites of the preceding asexual generation were already committed to either sexual development or continuing asexual cycling. In order to adjust to life in such drastically different environments, many changes occur in its cell biology, metabolism, gene expression and protein synthesis. Gametocytes of P. falciparum have been shown to exhibit a different pattern of gene expression than asexual stages, which is unsurprising if one were to consider the difference between these two stages. Transcription and translation levels are not constant during gametocytogenesis: this was shown in drug sensitivity studies where RNA and protein synthesis levels were much more important in the early than the late gametocyte stages. Furthermore, a sex-specific expression has also been discovered, with differences in RNA, mitochondria and ribosome content. The female is preparing for a continued development, and the male is terminally differentiated and only needs what is necessary for exflagellation ( cell division cycle, dynein and \u03b1-tubulin II). Plasmodium falciparum is both the most deadly and most researched species of malaria. The majority of the research conducted is to find a vaccine or treatment for the disease. Some believe that due to the ineffectiveness of the past, any vaccine found will most likely not become completely effective. Others remain hopeful citing the fact that the species complex life cycle offers numerous options for vaccines and treatments, as well as the proof that partial immunity does occur in endemic areas in some people. Mature macrogamtocytes are female and mature microgametocytes are male. In P. falciparum, gametocytes are produced from asexual stages. All the gametocytes produced from one sexually committed schizont are of the same sex, suggesting that sex is determined at the very beginning of sexual development. However, gametocyte sex can only be microscopically differentiated from stage III and onward. They are crescent- or sausage- shaped.",

This hypothesis, known as the Bateman\u2019s Principle, is used to understand the evolutionary pressures put on males and females due to anisogamy. Although this assumption has criticism, it is a generally accepted model for sexual selection within anisogamous species. The selection for different traits depending on sex within the same species is known as sex-specific selection, and accounts for the differing phenotypes found between the sexes of the same species.

The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) that consists of maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach \"Blaptica dubia\", as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, such as those in the genus of cockroaches known as \"Diploptera\", are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be \"univoltine\", \"bivoltine\" or \"multivoltine\", i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year. Other developmental and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, which is a type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is typical in bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different \"morphs\" or \"forms\", as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth \"Orgyia recens\" as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects.",

Bimaturism can refer to developmental differences within a sex related to secondary sex characteristics. For example, male orangutans reach sexual maturity around age 15 but undergo an additional period of development later in life before they exhibit cheek flanges.

Plumage dimorphism, in the form of ornamentation or coloration, also varies, though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly colored sex. Such differences have been attributed to the unequal reproductive contributions of the sexes. This difference produces a stronger female choice since they have more risk in producing offspring. In some species, the male's contribution to reproduction ends at copulation, while in other species the male becomes the main caregiver. Plumage polymorphisms have evolved to reflect these differences and other measures of reproductive fitness, such as body condition or survival.

Female common cuckoos are divided into gentes \u2013 groups of females favouring a particular host species' nest and laying eggs that match those of that species in color and pattern. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that each gene may have multiple independent origins due to parasitism of specific hosts by different ancestors. One hypothesis for the inheritance of egg appearance mimicry is that this trait is inherited from the female only, suggesting that it is carried on the sex-determining W chromosome (females are WZ, males ZZ). A genetic analysis of gentes supports this proposal by finding significant differentiation in mitochondrial DNA, but not in microsatellite DNA. A second proposal for the inheritance of this trait is that the genes controlling egg characteristics are carried on autosomes rather than just the W chromosome. Another genetic analysis of sympatric gentes supports this second proposal by finding significant genetic differentiation in both microsatellite DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Considering the tendency for common cuckoo males to mate with multiple females and produce offspring raised by more than one host species, it appears as though males do not contribute to the maintenance of common cuckoo gentes. However, it was found that only nine percent of offspring were raised outside of their father's presumed host species. Therefore, both males and females may contribute to the maintenance of common cuckoo egg mimicry polymorphism. It is notable that most non-parasitic cuckoo species lay white eggs, like most non-passerines other than ground-nesters. As the common cuckoo evolves to lay eggs that better imitate the host's eggs, the host species adapts and is more able to distinguish the cuckoo egg. A study of 248 common cuckoo and host eggs demonstrated that female cuckoos that parasitised common redstart nests laid eggs that matched better than those that targeted dunnocks. Spectroscopy was used to model how the host species saw the cuckoo eggs. Cuckoos that target dunnock nests lay white, brown-speckled eggs, in contrast to the dunnock's own blue eggs. The theory suggests that common redstarts have been parasitised by common cuckoos for longer, and so have evolved to be better than the dunnocks at noticing the cuckoo eggs.",

This intensifies male competition for mates and promotes the evolution of other sexual dimorphim in many species, especially in vertebrates including mammals.

Females have two X chromosomes. The Y chromosome is what determines sexual differentiation. If the Y chromosome is present, growth is along male lines. The SRY is a specific part of the Y chromosome which is the sex-determining gene region of the chromosome. This is what is responsible for the differentiation between male and females.  Testosterone helps differentiate gender by increasing the likelihood of male patterns of behavior. It has effects on the central nervous system that trigger these behaviors. Parts of the SRY and specific parts of the Y chromosome could also possibly influence different gender behaviors. The biological approach states that the distinction between men and women are due to inherent and hormonal differences. Some critique this approach because it leaves little room for sexual expression and gender because it claims both are dependent on biological makeup. Biological explanations of gender and sexual differences have been correlated to the work done by Charles Darwin regarding evolution. He suggested that just as wild animals and plants had physiological differences between sexes, humans did as well. Biological perspectives on psychological differentiation often place parallels to the physical nature of sexual differentiation. These parallels include genetic and hormonal factors that create different individuals, with the main difference being the reproductive function. The brain controls behavior by individuals, but it is influenced by genes, hormones and evolution. Evidence has shown that the ways boys and girls become men and women is different, and that there are variations between the individuals of each sex. There have been studies conducted to try and associate hormones with the gender identity of males and females. Okayama University in Japan did a study investigating the biological nature of gender identity disorder. The researchers looked at five different sex related hormones and whether or not they increased the chances of an individual being a transsexual. They examined male to female (MTF) and female to male (FTM) transsexuals, using control males and females for comparison. Their research did not find a significant difference in the distribution of the examined genes. The results currently can not provide evidence that the different genetic variants of sex hormone genes influence an individual to MTF or FTM transsexualism.",

Intersexual competition refers to the sexes feeding on different resources in order to reduce the competition within the species, while differential equilibrium refers to the different body sizes as a result of the opposing strategies of each sex to increase fitness. Females tend to lay more eggs and invest more time in those specific eggs directly opposing males who in order to increase their own fitness, spend less time on a specific group of eggs, and attempt to fertilise as many eggs as possible. The differential equilibrium hypothesis is well supported; however it cannot be deemed the clear answer because not enough experiments have tested intersexual competition. One problem with comparing these two different hypotheses comes from the chance that dimorphic niches may have evolved from something in the past that is no longer present today, also known as \"ghost of competition past\" by Connell. Information was collected from 3 main databases, which spanned 1503 species of Oriental and African Orthoptera, to determine females were larger in the majority of the 99.6% of the species.

In the hackberry emperor females are similarly larger than males. The reason for the sexual dimorphism is due to provision size mass, in which females consume more pollen than males. In some species, there is evidence of male dimorphism, but it appears to be for the purpose of distinctions of roles. This is seen in the bee species \"Macrotera portalis\" in which there is a small-headed morph, capable of flight, and large-headed morph, incapable of flight, for males. \"Anthidium manicatum\" also displays male-biased sexual dimorphism.

While kin selection is nonheritable and a direct result of the environment, sexual selection is a heritable adaptive behavior, and can therefore be characterized as a form of natural selection. Sexual selection refers specifically to competition for mates. Many traits or features that are characteristic of a certain species can be explained by sexual selection as an adaptive behavior; this is because competition for mates results in specific traits being inherited. Only the species that are able to successfully compete and obtain a mate will reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation. Therefore, species-specific genetic traits must be inherited, allowing individuals to be successful in their designated environments. There are many environmental examples of sexual selection as an adaptive behavior; one popular example is sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism is a morphological, phenotypic difference between males and females same species. A common example of sexual dimorphism is difference in body size. Sexual dimorphism can specifically be seen in the fish species, Lamprologus callipterus. These male fish are substantially larger (sometimes up to 60 times) than their female counterparts. The male's increased size is advantageous because the larger individual's are able to compete for female mates, and subsequently defend their offspring, which grow inside empty snail shells until birth. Basically, the larger the male fish, the bigger the adaptive benefit. The advantage of being larger and more powerful is demonstrated in the male's ability to compete and protect. In contrast to the males, the female fish must remain small in order to lay eggs inside the snail shells. It is evident that size plays a significant role in the reproductive success of this particular fish species. Large size is a common adaptive behavioral trait that is inherited through sexual selection and reproduction, as demonstrated in Lamprologus callipterus and other sexually dimorphic species.",

Each of these schistosomes, that are part of the genus \"Bivitellobilharzia\", sit near the base of a branch within the schistosome family that contains mammal-infecting species. This is a fairly new identified endoparasite that was found in 1955 by Mudaliar and Ramanujachari, who first recorded the parasite in India. Researchers collected fecal samples of the Indian rhinoceros and were startled to find \"B. nairi\" eggs.  The morphological characteristics of the egg are a spindle shape with a terminal spine The eggs are characteristically similar to \"schistosome\" eggs. They also share a distinct similarity with the eggs of the elephant blood fluke. Researchers sequenced specific sections of the fluke egg's DNA and found that the elephant blood fluke and the rhinoceros blook fluke matched sequences with each other. This can tell us that both species are hosts to the same parasites. The elephant schistosome is able to infect the Indian Rhinoceros. Elephants and Indian Rhinoceros must share the same physiological structures to be infected by the same \"B. nairi\" parasite. They also share the same habitat making transmission from one animal to next fairly easy.  \"Bivitellobilharzia nairi\", common name the elephant schistosome, is a parasitic trematode that uses the Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\") as a definitive host. Two other hosts may be the Indian elephant and the greater one-horned rhinoceros Once the elephant is infected, it releases schistosome eggs in the feces near a fresh water habitat where it infects the intermediate host, snails. The cercariae larval stage of the parasite will be released into freshwater and become free-swimming parasites to then penetrate the hosts' skin. Once inside the mammal the cercariae will loose its tail during infection and pair with an adult worm to sexually reproduce. Eggs produced in host will be passed in feces to then be deposited in freshwater once again and release the miracidia within. The miracidia will then penetrate the snail host tissue. These freshwater snails have been confirmed to be intermediate hosts. So far two intermediate snail genus have been identified; \"Indoplanorbis exustus\" and \"Lymnaea luteola\".",

After the discovery of the testis-determining gene SRY, many scientists shifted to the theory that the genetic mechanism that causes a fetus to develop into a male form was initiated by the SRY gene, which was thought to be responsible for the production of testosterone and its overall effects on body and brain development. This perspective still shares the classical way of thinking; that in order to produce two sexes, nature has developed a default female pathway and an active pathway by which male genes would initiate the process of determining a male sex, as something that is developed in addition to and based on the default female form. However, In an interview for the \"Rediscovering Biology\" website, researcher Eric Vilain described how the paradigm changed since the discovery of the SRY gene: In mammals, including humans, the SRY gene is responsible with triggering the development of non-differentiated gonads into testes, rather than ovaries. However, there are cases in which testes can develop in the absence of an SRY gene (see sex reversal). In these cases, the SOX9 gene, involved in the development of testes, can induce their development without the aid of SRY. In the absence of SRY and SOX9, no testes can develop and the path is clear for the development of ovaries. Even so, the absence of the SRY gene or the silencing of the SOX9 gene are not enough to trigger sexual differentiation of a fetus in the female direction. A recent finding suggests that ovary development and maintenance is an active process, regulated by the expression of a \"pro-female\" gene, FOXL2. In an interview for the \"TimesOnline\" edition, study co-author Robin Lovell-Badge explained the significance of the discovery: Looking into the genetic determinants of human sex can have wide-ranging consequences.
