The amino acid sequence found in the selectivity filter of KcsA is highly conserved among both prokaryotic and eukaryotic K voltage channels; as a result, research on KcsA has provided important structural and mechanistic insight on the molecular basis for K ion selection and conduction.

Channels differ with respect to the ion they let pass (for example, Na, K, Cl), the ways in which they may be regulated, the number of subunits of which they are composed and other aspects of structure. Channels belonging to the largest class, which includes the voltage-gated channels that underlie the nerve impulse, consists of four subunits with six transmembrane helices each. On activation, these helices move about and open the pore. Two of these six helices are separated by a loop that lines the pore and is the primary determinant of ion selectivity and conductance in this channel class and some others. The existence and mechanism for ion selectivity was first postulated in the late 1960s by Bertil Hille and Clay Armstrong. The idea of the ionic selectivity for potassium channels was that the carbonyl oxygens of the protein backbones of the \"selectivity filter\" (named by Bertil Hille) could efficiently replace the water molecules that normally shield potassium ions, but that sodium ions were smaller and cannot be completely dehydrated to allow such shielding, and therefore could not pass through. This mechanism was finally confirmed when the first structure of an ion channel was elucidated. A bacterial potassium channel KcsA, consisting of just the selectivity filter, \"P\" loop and two transmembrane helices was used as a model to study the permeability and the selectivity of ion channels in the Mackinnon lab. The determination of the molecular structure of KcsA by Roderick MacKinnon using X-ray crystallography won a share of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",

Several different occupancies of these sites are possible. Since the X-ray structures are averages over many molecules, it is, however, not possible to deduce the actual occupancies directly from such a structure.

The outward movement of positively charged potassium ions is due to random molecular motion (diffusion) and continues until enough excess negative charge accumulates inside the cell to form a membrane potential which can balance the difference in concentration of potassium between inside and outside the cell. \"Balance\" means that the electrical force (potential) that results from the build-up of ionic charge, and which impedes outward diffusion, increases until it is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the tendency for outward diffusive movement of potassium. This balance point is an \"equilibrium potential\" as the net transmembrane flux (or current) of K is zero.

However, the process of generating the resting potential within the cell also creates an environment outside the cell that favors depolarization. The sodium potassium pump is largely responsible for the optimization of conditions on both the interior and the exterior of the cell for depolarization. By pumping three positively charged sodium ions (Na) out of the cell for every two positively charged potassium ions (K) pumped into the cell, not only is the resting potential of the cell established, but an unfavorable concentration gradient is created by increasing the concentration of sodium outside the cell and increasing the concentration of potassium within the cell.

The proton-conducting HVCN1 channel has only transmembrane domains corresponding to the S1-S4 voltage sensing domains (VSD) of voltage-gated potassium channels and voltage-gated sodium channels. Molecular simulation is consistent with a water-filled pore that can function as a \"water wire\" for allowing hydrogen bonded H to cross the membrane. However, mutation of Asp112 in human Hv1 results in anion permeation, suggesting that obligatory protonation of Asp produces proton selectivity. Quantum mechanical calculations show that the Asp-Arg interaction can produce proton selective permeation. The HVCN1 protein has been shown to exist as a dimer with two functioning pores. Like other VSD channels, HVCN1 channels conduct ions about 1000-fold slower than channels formed by tetrameric S5-S6 central pores.",

Two different mechanisms can transport the ions across the membrane: active or passive transport. An example of active transport of ions is the Na-K-ATPase (NKA). NKA catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and an inorganic phosphate and for every molecule of ATP hydrolized, three Na are transported outside and two K are transported inside the cell. This makes the inside of the cell more negative than the outside and more specifically generates a V of about -60mV. An example of passive transport is ion fluxes through Na, K, Ca, and Cl channels. These ions tend to move down their concentration gradient. For example, since there is a high concentration of Na outside the cell, Na will flow through the Na channel into the cell. Since the electric potential inside the cell is negative, the influx of a positive ion depolarizes the membrane which brings the transmembrane electric potential closer to zero. However, Na will continue moving down its concentration gradient as long as the effect of the chemical gradient is greater than the effect of the electrical gradient. Once the effect of both gradients are equal (for Na this at a V of about +70mV), the influx of Na stops because the driving force (\u0394G) is zero. The equation for the driving force is:",

A-type K+ channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels and are transmembrane channels that help maintain the cell\u2019s membrane potential (Cai 2007). Typically, they play a crucial role in returning the cell to its resting membrane following an action potential by allowing an inhibitory current of K+ ions to quickly flow out of the neuron. The presence of these channels in such high density in the dendrites explains their inability to initiate an action potential, even during synaptic input. Additionally, the presence of these channels provides a mechanism by which the neuron can suppress and regulate the backpropagation of action potentials through the dendrite (Vetter 2000). Results have indicated a linear increase in the density of A-type channels with increasing distance into the dendrite away from the soma. The increase in the density of A-type channels results in a dampening of the backpropagating action potential as it travels into the dendrite. Essentially, inhibition occurs because the A-type channels facilitate the outflow of K+ ions in order to maintain the membrane potential below threshold levels (Cai 2007). Such inhibition limits EPSP and protects the neuron from entering a never-ending positive-positive feedback loop between the soma and the dendrites.",

The concentration differences between the inside and outside of the cell determine the membrane voltage.Precisely how these currents are controlled has become much clearer with the advances in receptor structure and G-protein-coupled processes.

Transmitters typically bind at the junction between two of these proteins, on the parts that protrude from the cell membrane. If the receptor is of the ionotropic type, a central pore or channel in the middle of the proteins will be mechanically moved to allow certain ions to flow through, thus altering the ion concentration difference.

It is thought that tertiapin binds to the Kir channel with its \u03b1-helix situated at the C-terminal of the peptide. This \u03b1-helix is plugged into the external end of the conduction pore, thereby blocking the channel. The N-terminal of the peptide sticks out of the extracellular side. Tertiapin has a high affinity for Kir channels with approximately Kd = 8 nM for GIRK1/4 channels and Kd = 2 nM for ROMK1 channels. In contrast to the voltage-gated K+ channels, Kir channels are more permeable to K during hyperpolarization than during depolarization. A voltage-dependent blockade by intracellular cations at voltages more positive than the K reversal potential is the mechanism underlying this feature. At more negative voltages the Kir channels are responsible for an inward K+ current. Therefore K channels contribute to the maintenance of the resting potential, the duration of the action potential and the neuronal excitability. GIRK1 and -4 are subunits of the muscarinic potassium channels (KACh) and have an important role in the slowing down of the heart rate in response to parasympathetic stimulation via acetylcholine. KAch channels activate during hyperpolarization, prolonging the cardiac action potential by inflow of potassium ions and reducing the frequency of action potential generation. An inhibition by tertiapin will result in a shorter cardiac action potential with loss of parasympathetic control, resulting in a faster heart rate ROMK is found in the kidneys where it contributes to K recycling. An inhibition will result in loss of potassium, as observed in Bartter syndrome, which can be caused by mutations in the ROMK channels.",

The existence and mechanism for ion selectivity was first postulated in the late 1960s by Bertil Hille and Clay Armstrong. The idea of the ionic selectivity for potassium channels was that the carbonyl oxygens of the protein backbones of the \"selectivity filter\" (named by Bertil Hille) could efficiently replace the water molecules that normally shield potassium ions, but that sodium ions were smaller and cannot be completely dehydrated to allow such shielding, and therefore could not pass through. This mechanism was finally confirmed when the first structure of an ion channel was elucidated. A bacterial potassium channel KcsA, consisting of just the selectivity filter, \"P\" loop and two transmembrane helices was used as a model to study the permeability and the selectivity of ion channels in the Mackinnon lab.

They have also been implicated in apoptosis in plants. CNG ion channels are also thought to be involved in pollen development in plants, however its exact role in this mechanism is still not known.",

            "document": "KcsA potassium channel . In 2006, the Perozo group proposed a mechanistic explanation for the effects of voltage fields on KcsA gating. After adding a depolarizing current to the channel, the reorientation of Glu71 towards the intracellular pore occurs, thereby disrupting the Glu71-Asp80 carboxyl-carboxylate pair that initially stabilizes the selectivity filter. The collapse of the filter region prevents entry into or facilitate exit from the inactivated state. Glu71, a key part of the selectivity filter signature sequence that is conserved among K ion channels, plays a pivotal role in gating as its ability to reorient itself in the direction of the transmembrane voltage field is able to provide an explanation for voltage gating events in KcsA. The orientation of amino acids in the filter region might play significant physiological role in modulating potassium fluxes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes under steady-state conditions.",

In the functional dyad model, a lysine residue interacts with a hydrophobic Leu, Tyr, Met or Phe residue, in order to recognize the K-channel. On the extracellular side of the channel, the side-chain of the lysine residue will enter the pore and subsequently block the channel. In HgeTx1, it seems likely that the Lys24 residue will interact with the hydrophobic Met33 or Leu34 residue according to the functional dyad model, which allows it to block the \"Shaker B\" K-channel.",

The simplicity of the two transmembrane helices in KcsA, as opposed to the six in many eukaryotic ion channels, also provided a method to understand the mechanisms of K channels conduction at a more rudimentary level, thereby providing even great impetus for the study of KcsA.",

Sometimes, when referring to the pharmacological effects of drugs, the terms \"hERG channels\" and \"I\" are used interchangeably, but, in the technical sense, \"hERG channels\" can be made only by scientists in the laboratory; in formal terms, the naturally occurring channels in the body that include hERG are referred to by the name of the electrical current that has been measured in that cell type, so, for example, in the heart, the correct name is \"I\". This difference in nomenclature becomes clearer in the controversy as to whether the channels conducting \"I\" include other subunits (e.g., beta subunits) or whether the channels include a mixture of different types (isoforms) of hERG, but, when the originally-discovered form of hERG is experimentally transferred into cells that previously lacked hERG (i.e., heterologous expression), a potassium ion channel is formed, and this channel has many signature features of the cardiac 'rapid' delayed rectifier current (\"I\"), including \"I\"'s inward rectification that results in the channel producing a 'paradoxical resurgent current' in response to repolarization of the membrane.",

This proteins forms a sodium-selective ion channel, that relies on an electrochemical gradient. The protein consists of four homology domains, HD1, HD2, HD3 and HD4. Each homology domain has six alpha helical segments, S1-S6. The small alpha-helical region between S5 and S6 is known as the channel pore. Mutations within this region may be responsible for ion selectivity. The cytoplasmic loop between HD3 and HD4 is responsible for fast inactivation and blocking conductance. The voltage sensor 4 in HD III is partially formed by exon L and K. The alternative splicing at this locus causes a difference in the charged current at this channel. Exon L produces 8% of the transient current, which falls to 2% when the K exon is incorporated. \"Paralytic\" encodes a protein channel which transfers sodium ions into neurons and is activated in response to changes in the voltage across a membrane to propagate an action potential. The paralytic protein has been found in the thoracic-abdominal ganglion, eye tissues and cortical regions in the brain.",

The concentrations of these ions are reversed inside the cells. Due to the difference in concentration, there is a chemical gradient across the cell membrane, which leads to sodium influx and potassium efflux. When the action potential takes place, a considerable change in extracellular potassium concentration occurs due to the limited volume of the CNS extracellular space. The change in potassium concentration in the extracellular space impacts a variety of neuronal processes, such as maintenance of membrane potential, activation and inactivation of voltage gated channels, synaptic transmission, and electrogenic transport of neurotransmitter. Change of extracellular potassium concentration of from 3mM can affect neural activity. Therefore, there are diverse cellular mechanisms for tight control of potassium ions, the most widely accepted mechanisms being K+ spatial buffering mechanism. Orkand and his colleagues who first theorized spatial buffering stated \u201cif a Glial cell becomes depolarized by K+ that has accumulated in the clefts, the resulting current carries K+ inward in the high [K+] region and out again, through electrically coupled Glial cells in low [K+] regions\u201d  In the model presented by Orkand and his colleagues, glial cells intake and traverse potassium ions from region of high concentrations to region of low concentration maintaining potassium concentration to be low in extracellular space.
