The fungicide does not kill the pathogen itself, but only works on the pre-necrotic spots on the leaves, stopping the secondary spores from inoculating new, healthy plant tissue. The best time to apply, due to it being a protective fungicide, would be in the beginning of the season in order to stop any initial infection. The class of fungicides widely used to control for Black Leaf Streak are the triazole fungicides. This class of fungicide is a demethylation inhibitor and should be rotated with other modes of action to best lower the risk of resistance. The leaves that have already been infected must be removed mechanically to save the rest of the tree. Research has shown that there may be fungicide resistance developing for \"M. fijiensis\". It has been observed that following the application of intense chemicals, the fungus persisted and spread. The same observations were found in fields with no chemical interference; the belief now being that the untreated fields are \u201cbreeding grounds for (the) development of resistant strains\u201d. Research today shows continuous action towards reinventing banana breeding programs. However, some cultivars of bananas are resistant to the disease. Research is done to improve productivity and fruit properties of these cultivars. A genetically modified banana variety made more resistant to the fungus was developed and was field tested in Uganda in the late 2000s. Furthermore, the search for genetic resistance shows promise with the discovery of a protein that can produce a hypersensitive response to control \"M. fijiensis\" that is being introduced to the banana trees. This in turn will hopefully show that there is a resistant gene available to be manufactured and injected to make new genetically modified, pathogen-resistant banana trees.",

Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow ripen prematurely, making them unsuitable for export. The fungus has shown ever-increasing resistance to treatment, with the current expense for treating exceeding $1,000 per year.

Proteins produced in the symplast included RXLR proteins, which contain an arginine-X-leucine-arginine (where X can be any amino acid) sequence at the amino terminus of the protein. Some RXLR proteins are avirulence proteins, meaning that they can be detected by the plant and lead to a hypersensitive response which restricts the growth of the pathogen. \"P. infestans\" was found to encode around 60% more of these proteins than most other \"Phytophthora\" species. Those found in the apoplast include hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, lipases and glycosylases that act to degrade plant tissue, enzyme inhibitors to protect against host defence enzymes and necrotizing toxins. Overall the genome was found to have an extremely high repeat content (around 74%) and to have an unusual gene distribution in that some areas contain many genes whereas others contain very few.",

Her research has provided new insights into the evolution of pathogens and the role that horizontal gene transfer and genomic islands play. She confirmed the anecdotal assumption that virulence factors (disease-causing genes in pathogens) are disproportionately associated with genomic islands. She was among the first researchers to use whole genome sequencing to aid infectious disease outbreak investigations (\"genomic epidemiology\"), integrating genome sequence data with social network analysis.

The fungicide does not kill the pathogen itself, but only works on the pre-necrotic spots on the leaves, stopping the secondary spores from inoculating new, healthy plant tissue. The best time to apply, due to it being a protective fungicide, would be in the beginning of the season in order to stop any initial infection. The class of fungicides widely used to control for Black Leaf Streak are the triazole fungicides. This class of fungicide is a demethylation inhibitor and should be rotated with other modes of action to best lower the risk of resistance. The leaves that have already been infected must be removed mechanically to save the rest of the tree. Research has shown that there may be fungicide resistance developing for \"M. fijiensis\".

The same observations were found in fields with no chemical interference; the belief now being that the untreated fields are \u201cbreeding grounds for (the) development of resistant strains\u201d.

Furthermore, the search for genetic resistance shows promise with the discovery of a protein that can produce a hypersensitive response to control \"M. fijiensis\" that is being introduced to the banana trees.

By 1950 it had spread to all the banana-producing regions of the world with the exception of some islands in the South Pacific, the Mediterranean, Melanesia and Somalia. Panama disease affects a wide range of banana cultivars; however, it is best known for the damage it caused to a single cultivar in the early export plantations. Before 1960, a total reliance was put on the cultivar 'Gros Michel', and it supplied almost all the export trade. It proved susceptible to the disease and the use of infected rhizomes to establish new plantations caused widespread and severe losses. Some indication of the scale of the losses is demonstrated by the complete eradication of production on 30,000 hectares of plantation in the Ulua Valley of Honduras between 1940 and 1960. In Suriname, an entire operation of 4,000 hectares was out of business within eight years and in the Quepos area of Costa Rica, 6,000 hectares were destroyed in twelve years. By the mid-1900s, resistant cultivars in the 'Cavendish' subgroup were being used as a substitute for 'Gros Michel' in the export trade. These cultivars have proved resilient and grow well in the western tropics, remaining the clones on which the current export trades are based. Unfortunately, in several growing areas in the Eastern Hemisphere these cultivars are susceptible to the disease. It is considered inevitable that this susceptibility will spread to the Western Hemisphere, and this poses a significant threat to production because there are currently no acceptable replacement cultivars. To make things worse, this variant of the pathogen also affects plantains, \"Musa acuminata \u00d7 balbisiana\", which are an important staple food in tropical regions of the world. The average American eats 26.2 pounds of the Cavendish banana each year and the question is being asked as to whether this oft-consumed fruit is on course to extinction.",

In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective.

Metalaxyl is a fungicide that was marketed for use against \"P. infestans\", but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own. In some regions of the world during the 1980s and 1990s, most strains of \"P. infestans\" became resistant to metalaxyl, but in subsequent years many populations shifted back to sensitivity. To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as metalaxyl along with carbamate compounds. A combination of other compounds are recommended for managing metalaxyl-resistant strains. These include mandipropamid, chlorothalonil, fluazinam, triphenytin, mancozeb, and others.

However, the usefulness of cultivar mixtures may be limited in this regard due to the size of the mango tree host, where autoinfection with the pathogen is extremely likely. In addition, rotation of or alternation of fungicides applied to the crop is suggested in order to prevent resistance from developing. Resistant varieties of mango, such as Tommy Atkins, will still produce fruit following infection. However, yield is still affected as the fruit produced tends to be smaller, and peduncles tend to be thicker. Non-resistant cultivars will be unable to bear fruit at all if this disease is left untreated. Two mango varieties evaluated as most resistant to powdery mildew are the Rocha and Regina cultivars. Many countries have also enacted quarantine procedures against many mango pathogens, including \"O. mangiferae\", with the intent of preventing the pathogen from spreading to new areas or being introduced into resident crops. Quarantine techniques include washing of fruit, fungicide application prior to import, and exposure to hot water to decontaminate.",

The best way to control \"L. taurica\" is to remove all crop residue from the previous onion crop before subsequent planting. Two methods to accomplish this include deep tillage, and rotating to a non-host crop the year following an onion crop. Controlling volunteer onion sprouting (or the emergence of the previous year's onion plants) will also assist in prevention of the pathogen from carrying-over from one year to the next. Irrigation practices can also be used to limit the development of OPM. Moisture stress has been noted to increase the susceptibility of host species to \"L. taurica\". Onions with adequate moisture will be more resistant to the pathogen, and onion crops with overhead irrigation rarely see powdery mildew development in the field. The fungicide Cabrio (produced by BASF Chemical) is labeled for the control of \"L. taurica\" on onions, but the disease rarely progresses enough to justify the use of a fungicide. Considerations of economic benefit should be made before the fungicide is applied, and all labeling directions followed. Resistant varieties have been found in some studies, Jahn et al. found powdery mildew resistance to be extremely beneficial in cucurbits, reducing the need for fungicide, and reducing agricultural losses due to powdery mildew pathogens. Although a truly resistant variety has not been found for onion plants, some onion genotypes with glossy leaves had selective susceptibility to \"L. taurica\". Onions with the glossiest leaves were found to be most susceptible, while onions with less glossy leaves showed limited susceptibility. However, the study was unable to come to a conclusion on which variety was best suited for \"L. taurica\" resistance.",
