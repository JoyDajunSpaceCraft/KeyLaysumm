However, the bacteria are also able to survive in soils and other plants without infection. The ability of \"D. dadantii\" to live in the soil as a plant pathogen is regulated by virulence genes in response to environmental factors that control whether the bacterium is saphrophytic or pathogenic. When \"D. dadantii\" is virulent it enters primarily through hydathodes and wounds, with the assistance of jasmonates, where the bacteria rapidly breakdown the parenchymatous tissues with the use of pectic enzymes). \"D. dadantii\" produces many pectinases that are responsible for disassembly of the plant cell wall. After the cell wall is degraded, and the contents of the cell are accessed, \"D. dadantii\" catabolizes glucose by a fermentation pathway. After the plant has been accessed, colonization is a complicated process that requires many additional factors for successful infection. These factors include: \u201ccellulases, iron assimilation, a Hrp type III secretion system, exopolysaccharides, motility, and proteins involved in resistance against plant defense mechanisms\u201d. The plant attempts to resist the infection with different defense mechanisms and \"D. dadantii\" must overcome obstacles, such as defense barriers, secondary metabolites and toxic materials. An example of a plant defense mechanism is to produce a defensive barrier, such as a cork layer. However, when the infection is spread by larvae, the cork layer is eaten as quickly as it is made by the plant. Consequently, the protective cork layer is an ineffective protection mechanism. The bacteria continue to spread and multiply throughout the plant, moving in the intercellular spaces, within collapsed cells and the xylem. As the bacteria grow in numbers, additional hosts are infected through the spread of bacteria by: splashing water from infected plants, insects, and cultural practices including the use of contaminated tools, gloves and machinery and improper storage of cultivated crops or seeds. \"D. dadantii\" can be a problem year round, given the right environmental conditions exist.

Murepavadin exhibits a specific and potent bactericidal activity \"in vitro\" against \"P. aeruginosa\" including carbapenemase-producing and colistin-resistant isolates and was shown to be largely inactive against other Gram-negative bacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria. When tested in a large minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) surveillance study, against 1219 contemporary clinical isolates from the USA, Europe, and China of which 28% were MDR strains, murepavadin exhibited a potent antimicrobial activity having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 0.12\u00a0mg/L. There were no significant differences between geographic locations, and there was little difference in activity between MDR/and non-MDR isolates and no cross-resistance was observed with any other antimicrobial tested which supports its novel mechanism of action. Murepavadin showed outstanding \"in vivo\" efficacy in mouse septicemia (ED50 of 0.25 - 0.55\u00a0mg/kg) and lung and thigh infection models. It displays linear pharmacokinetics, is dose proportional with a good penetration into the epithelial lung fluid which underscores its potent \"in vivo\" activity in lung infection models including extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates. In phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers, single doses were well tolerated at plasma concentrations expected to meet or exceed efficacious levels, with no serious adverse events reported. The favorable \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" properties of murepavadin combined with an appropriate safety pharmacology and toxicology profile led to the clinical development of murepavadin for the treatment of serious infections caused by \"P. aeruginosa\". Murepavadin successfully completed phase-II clinical tests in hospital patients with life-threatening \"Pseudomonas\" lung infections and is in phase III development for the treatment of bacterial HAP/ bacterial VAP due to \"P. aeruginosa\" infection.",

Therefore, microbes have evolved to secret siderophores, Fe-binding peptides, into the surroundings and then actively transport the Fe-complex back into the cell by active transport. This can also be seen with pathogenic bacteria inside its host, where iron is bound tightly by haemoglobin, transferrin, lactoferrin and ferritin, and thus low in concentration (10 mol L). Here it secrets siderophores which has a higher affinity (with a formation constant, or ([ML])/([M][L]), of 10)to Fe than the host's iron-binding proteins, and so will remove iron and then transported inside the cell. \"Bacillus anthracis\", a Gram-positive bacteria that causes anthrax, secretes two siderophores: bacillibactin and petrobactin. \"Escherichia coli\" secrets many iron-siderophore transports, but produce only one siderophore\u2014enterobactin. The ferric enterobactin receptor FepA recognises the catecholate part of ferric enterobactin (FeEnt), and transports it across the outer membrane from the extracellular space into the periplasm. The binding is thought to be in two phases, a fast step which recognises FeEnt, and a slower step which may be the first step in translocation\u2014preparing the complex for translocation. Both steps occur independently of the TonB\u2013ExbB\u2013ExbD complex and the proton motive force it provides. In the periplasm, FeEnt is bound by FepB and passed to the integral inner membrane proteins FepG and FepD through active transport, with the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis catalysed by cytoplasmic FepC. In the cytoplasm, the Fes enterobactin esterase hydrolyses and this cleaves enterobactin, releasing Fe which will subsequently be reduced by the same protein, Fes, to Fe.",

It leaves the vacuoles early, which allows for efficient replication of the bacteria inside the cell. Leaving the cell early also keeps the bacteria from being destroyed by lysosomal defensins and other pathogen-killing agents. MNGCs may help protect the bacteria from immune responses. \"B. mallei\"\u2019s ability to live within the host cell makes developing a vaccine against it difficult and complex.

Pathogenicity depends on many different factors such as the production of the siderophore desferrioxamine, metalloproteases, plasmids, and histone-like proteins.

Siderophores are iron-scavenging molecules produced by many microbial taxa, including bacteria and fungi. These molecules are known as chelating agents and play an important role in facilitating the uptake and metabolism of iron in the environment, as it normally exists in an insoluble form. In order for bacteria to access this limiting factor, cells will manufacture these molecules, and then secrete them into the extracellular space. Once released, the siderophores will sequester the iron, and form a complex, which is recognized by bacterial cell receptors. It can then be transported into the cell and reduced, making the iron metabolically accessible for the bacteria. The production of siderophores is often used as an example of mutualism as the compounds are not constricted to individual usage. As long as the organism possesses a receptor for the siderophore-Fe (III) complex, they can be taken up and utilized.",
