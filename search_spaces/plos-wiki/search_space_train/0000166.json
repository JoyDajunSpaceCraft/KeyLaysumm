R1 group is responsible for the binding of the drug to its active binding site of PDE5. Solubility is one of the pharmacological properties that was increased. A group was substituted for the hydrogen atom as demonstrated in figure 6. The sulfonamide group was chosen to lower lipophilicity and increase solubility as seen in figure 7. Solubility was further increased by placing a methyl group at R positions as demonstrated in figure 7. Other phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors were developed from the structure in figure 7. Although PDE5 inhibitors main use has been for erectile dysfunction there has been a great interest in PDE5 inhibitors as a promising new therapeutic agents for treatment of other diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Elevation of cGMP levels through inhibition of PDE5 provides a way of improving memory and learning. PDE5 has also been considered as a potential therapeutic agent for parasitic disease such as African sleeping sickness. Strategic changes were made to the structure of sildenafil so the molecule could project into a parasite-specific pocket (the p-pocket). Similar approach has been used to design therapeutic agents \"Plasmodium falciparum\".",

For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.",

The catalytic site of ATCase is located at the interface between two neighboring catalytic chains in the same trimer and incorporates amino acid side-chains from both of these subunits.

This compound is a strong inhibitor of ATCase and has a structure that is thought to be very close to that of the transition state of the substrates. Additionally, crystal structures of ATCase bound to carbamoylphosphate and succinate have been obtained. These studies, in addition to investigations using site-directed mutagenesis of specific amino acids, have identified several residues that are crucial for catalysis, such as Ser52, Thr53, Arg54, Thr55, Arg105, His134, Gln137, Arg167, Arg229, Glu231, and Ser80 and Lys84 from an adjacent catalytic chain. The active site is a highly positively charged pocket. One of the most critical side-chains is from Arg54, which interacts with a terminal oxygen and the anhydride oxygen of carbamoyl phosphate, stabilizing the negative charge of the leaving phosphate group. Arg105, His134, and Thr55 help to increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon by interacting with the carbonyl oxygen.

Based on crystallography data of homologous NADP-dependent malic enzymes of mammalian origin, a 3D model for C pathway NADP-ME in plants has been developed, identifying the key residues involved in substrate-binding or catalysis. Dinucleotide binding involves two glycine rich GXGXXG motifs, a hydrophobic groove involving at least six amino acid residues, and a negatively charged residue at the end of the \u03b2B-strand. The primary sequence of the first motif, GLGDLG, is a consensus marker for phosphate binding, evidencing involvement with NADP binding, while the other glycine rich motif adopts a classical Rossman fold\u2014also a typical marker for NADP cofactor binding. Mutagenesis experiments in maize NADP-ME have supported the current model. Valine substitution for glycine in either motif region rendered the enzyme completely inactive while spectral analysis indicated no major changes from wild-type form. The data is suggestive of direct impairment at a key residue involved in binding or catalysis rather than an inter-domain residue influencing conformational stability.  Additionally, a key arginine residue at site 237 has been shown to interact both with malate and NADP substrates, forming key favorable electrostatic interactions to the negatively charged carboxylic-acid and phosphate group respectively.

Hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate group of MgATP provides the energy needed to transfer electrons from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. The binding interactions between the MgATP phosphate groups and the amino acid residues of the Fe protein are well understood by comparing to similar enzymes, while the interactions with the rest of the molecule are more elusive due to the lack of a Fe protein crystal structure with MgATP bound (as of 1996). Three protein residues have been shown to have significant interactions with the phosphates, shown in Figure 6. In the absence of MgATP, a salt bridge exists between residue 15, lysine, and residue 125, aspartic acid. Upon binding, this salt bridge is interrupted. Site-specific mutagenesis has demonstrated that when the lysine is substituted for a glutamine, the protein\u2019s affinity for MgATP is greatly reduced and when the lysine is substituted for an arginine, MgATP cannot bind due to the salt bridge being too strong. The necessity of specifically aspartic acid at site 125 has been shown through noting altered reactivity upon mutation of this residue to glutamic acid. The third residue that has been shown to be key for MgATP binding is residue 16, serine. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to demonstrate this fact. This has led to a model in which the serine remains coordinated to the Mg ion after phosphate hydrolysis in order to facilitate its association with a different phosphate of the now ADP molecule. MgATP binding also induces significant conformational changes within the Fe protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to create mutants in which MgATP binds but does not induce a conformational change. Comparing X-ray scattering data in the mutants versus in the wild-type protein led to the conclusion that the entire protein contracts upon MgATP binding, with a decrease in radius of approximately 2.0 \u00c5.",

These overall similarities have called for concerns over potential side effects from drugs targeting vNEU. Nevertheless, most of the well studied vNEU inhibitors have shown very little affinity for hNEU except for the influenza drug Zanamivir which is an effective inhibitor for hNEU2.",

Drug design, often referred to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.",

The resolution of the 3D structure of germinal ACE, which has only one active site that corresponds with C-domain of the somatic ACE, offers a structural framework for structure-based design approach. Although N- and C-domain have comparable rates \"in vitro\" of ACE hydrolyzing, it seems like that \"in vivo\" the C-domain is mainly responsible for regulating blood pressure. This indicates that C-domain selective inhibitors could have similar profile to that of a current non-selective inhibitors. Angiotensin I is mainly hydrolyzed by the C-domain \"in vivo\" but bradykinin is hydrolyzed by both active sites. Thus, by developing a C-domain selective inhibitor would permit some degradation of bradykinin by the N-domain and this degradation could be enough to prevent accumulation of excess bradykinin which has been observed during attacks of angioedema. C-domain selective inhibition could possibly result in specialized control of blood pressure with less vasodilator-related adverse effects. N-domain selective inhibitors on the other hand give the possibility of opening up novel therapeutic areas.

Traditionally reversible enzyme inhibitors have been classified as competitive, uncompetitive, or non-competitive, according to their effects on \"K\" and \"V\". These different effects result from the inhibitor binding to the enzyme E, to the enzyme\u2013substrate complex ES, or to both, respectively. The division of these classes arises from a problem in their derivation and results in the need to use two different binding constants for one binding event. The binding of an inhibitor and its effect on the enzymatic activity are two distinctly different things, another problem the traditional equations fail to acknowledge. In noncompetitive inhibition the binding of the inhibitor results in 100% inhibition of the enzyme only, and fails to consider the possibility of anything in between. In noncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor will bind to an enzyme at its allosteric site; therefore, the binding affinity, or Km, of the substrate with the enzyme will remain the same. On the other hand, the Vmax will decrease relative to an uninhibited enzyme. On a Lineweaver-Burk plot, the presence of a noncompetitive inhibitor is illustrated by a change in the y-intercept, defined as 1/Vmax. The x-intercept, defined as -1/Km, will remain the same. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor will bind to an enzyme at the active site, competing with the substrate. As a result, the Km will increase and the Vmax will remain the same.

Based on crystallography data of homologous NADP-dependent malic enzymes of mammalian origin, a 3D model for C pathway NADP-ME in plants has been developed, identifying the key residues involved in substrate-binding or catalysis. Dinucleotide binding involves two glycine rich GXGXXG motifs, a hydrophobic groove involving at least six amino acid residues, and a negatively charged residue at the end of the \u03b2B-strand. The primary sequence of the first motif, GLGDLG, is a consensus marker for phosphate binding, evidencing involvement with NADP binding, while the other glycine rich motif adopts a classical Rossman fold\u2014also a typical marker for NADP cofactor binding. Mutagenesis experiments in maize NADP-ME have supported the current model. Valine substitution for glycine in either motif region rendered the enzyme completely inactive while spectral analysis indicated no major changes from wild-type form. The data is suggestive of direct impairment at a key residue involved in binding or catalysis rather than an inter-domain residue influencing conformational stability.  Additionally, a key arginine residue at site 237 has been shown to interact both with malate and NADP substrates, forming key favorable electrostatic interactions to the negatively charged carboxylic-acid and phosphate group respectively.

There are two alternatively spliced first exons, one of which, exon 1A, is transcribed in a wide variety of cell types; the other, exon 1B, is transcribed in fast muscle tissue. Exon 1A is transcribed from a promoter that has the structural hallmarks of a housekeeping promoter but lies more than 35 kb upstream of exon 2. Exon 1B lies 6 kb upstream of exon 2 within the large first intron of the ubiquitously expressed PGM1 transcript.

Hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate group of MgATP provides the energy needed to transfer electrons from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. The binding interactions between the MgATP phosphate groups and the amino acid residues of the Fe protein are well understood by comparing to similar enzymes, while the interactions with the rest of the molecule are more elusive due to the lack of a Fe protein crystal structure with MgATP bound (as of 1996). Three protein residues have been shown to have significant interactions with the phosphates, shown in Figure 6. In the absence of MgATP, a salt bridge exists between residue 15, lysine, and residue 125, aspartic acid. Upon binding, this salt bridge is interrupted. Site-specific mutagenesis has demonstrated that when the lysine is substituted for a glutamine, the protein\u2019s affinity for MgATP is greatly reduced and when the lysine is substituted for an arginine, MgATP cannot bind due to the salt bridge being too strong. The necessity of specifically aspartic acid at site 125 has been shown through noting altered reactivity upon mutation of this residue to glutamic acid. The third residue that has been shown to be key for MgATP binding is residue 16, serine. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to demonstrate this fact. This has led to a model in which the serine remains coordinated to the Mg ion after phosphate hydrolysis in order to facilitate its association with a different phosphate of the now ADP molecule. MgATP binding also induces significant conformational changes within the Fe protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to create mutants in which MgATP binds but does not induce a conformational change. Comparing X-ray scattering data in the mutants versus in the wild-type protein led to the conclusion that the entire protein contracts upon MgATP binding, with a decrease in radius of approximately 2.0 \u00c5.",

Glycogen branching enzyme belongs to the \u03b1-amylase family of enzymes, which include \u03b1-amylases, pullulanas/isoamylase, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGT), and branching enzyme. Shown by x-ray crystallography, glycogen branching enzyme has four marginally asymmetric units each that are organized into three domains: an amino-terminal domain, involved in determining the length of the chain transfer, a carboxyl-terminal domain, involved in substrate preference and catalytic capacity, and a central (\u03b1/\u03b2) barrel catalytic domain. The amino-terminal domain consists of 128 residues arranged in seven \u03b2-strands, the carboxyl-terminal domain with 116 residues also organized in seven \u03b2-strands, and the (\u03b1/\u03b2) barrel domain with 372 residues. While the central (\u03b1/\u03b2) barrel domain is common in members of the \u03b1-amylase family, numerous variations exist between the various barrel domains. Additionally, there are striking differences between the loops connecting elements of the secondary structure among these various \u03b1-amylase members, especially around the active site. In comparison to the other family members, glycogen binding enzyme has shorter loops, which result in a more open cavity, favorable to the binding of a bulkier substrate such as branched sugar. Through primary structure analysis and the x-ray crystallographic structures of the members of the \u03b1-amylase family, seven residue were conserved, Asp335, His340, Arg403, Asp 405, Glu458, His525, and Asp526 (E coli. numbering).

Protein kinases, many of which are regulated by autophosphorylation, are vital in controlling the cellular proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, migration and survival.

Therefore, it is an effective method of turning 'on' and 'off' kinase activity. Because of this it is recognized as an essential process in cell signaling.  Addition of a negatively charged phosphate group brings about a change in the microenvironment that may lead to attraction or repulsion of other residues or molecules. The result may be a conformational change to expose or hide catalytic or allosteric seats from the surface.  If the phosphorylated residue resides within the catalytic seat itself, it may facilitate or prevent substrate binding by means of charge-interaction, or by providing or preventing complementary shapes necessary for molecular recognition. In addition, the phosphate group yields several potential areas for hydrogen-bonding or establishment of salt-bridges, of which the latter generally involves an arginine residue.  Binding of effector molecules may be affected in a similar manner if the phosphorylated residue makes part of the allosteric site.

Each subunit tightly binds one molecule of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate tightly on each subunit.

The conjugate (10S,11S) JH diol phosphate is the product of a two-step enzymatic process: conversion of JH to JH diol and then addition of a phosphate group to C10. The enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of JH diol is JH diol kinase (JHDK), which was first characterized from the Malpighian tubules of early fifth instars of \"M. sexta\". JHDK (EC 2.1.7.3) was discovered when an analysis of JH I metabolites in vivo yielded, in addition to the expected metabolites, a very polar JH I conjugate that was subsequently identified as JH I diol phosphate. Maxwell et al. showed JHDK to contain 3 potential calcium binding sites, and a single ATP-Mg2+ binding site (p-loop). The modeled structure contains nine helices, one beta sheet, and 10 loops. JHDK is also present in the silkworm, where it also functions as homodimer. It lacks a JH response element; Li et al. (2005). It has a high degree of identity to \"M. sexta\" JHDK. Later Uno et al. (2007) characterized the \"A. mellifera\" enzyme in a proteomic study. It has 183 amino acid residues. More recently, Zeng et al. (2015) have characterized JHDK from \"Spodoptera litura\". It also has 183 amino acid residues, just as does the \"B. mori\" enzyme. These enzymes all have high sequence similarity. The M. sexta enzyme contains 184 residues. JHDK from \"M. sexta\" Malpighian tubules is a cytosolic protein composed of two identical subunits of 20 kDa, as determined by MS. Gel filtration studies indicate it has a molecular mass of approximately 43 kDa. JHDK displays a \"K\" in the nanomolar range for JH I diol, which is appropriate for an enzyme responsible for clearance of a hormone whose titers rarely exceeds 10 nM. Most significantly, the catalytic activity of JHDK parallels developmentally that of JHEH, a requisite if JH diol phosphate is a legitimate terminal metabolite. Analysis of the \"k\"cat/\"K\" ratio for the diols of JH I, II, and III indicates that JH I diol is the preferred substrate, suggesting a preference for an ethyl group at the C7 position. JHDK requires both Mg and ATP for activity. Characterization of the juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase (JHEH) and juvenile hormone diol phosphotransferase (JHDPT) from \"Manduca sexta\" Malpighian tubules. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 30, 255-270 ), although excess Mg and Ca inhibit its activity. The specificity of JHDK for JH I diol is relatively high, considering the multitude of potential phosphate acceptor groups present in a cell. The enzyme does not recognize methyl geranoate diol (one isoprenyl unit shorter than JH) nor methyl geranylgeranoate diol (one isoprenyl group longer than JH), yet it does recognize JH I ethyl ester diol. It also recognizes both JH diol enantiomers, indicating that the absolute stereospecificity of the hydroxy groups is of minor importance. Most surprising is the enzyme's inability to recognize JH acid diols. Because JH acid diol cannot be phosphorylated by JHDK, the generally accepted pathway for JH catabolism (JH acid is converted to JH acid diol) must be reconsidered. Still, the role of cellular JHE becomes problematic if the pathway catalyzed by JHEH and JHDK is the major pathway for JH catabolism in the cell. The fact that JH diol phosphate is a significant metabolite certainly weakens the long-held dogma that JH esterase is most important in JH catabolism. While JHE has been noted to have phosphatase activity, to our knowledge it has never been tested on JH diol phosphate. The sequence and hypothetical structures of \"M. sexta\", \"D. melanogaster\", and \"B. mori\" JHDK have been analyzed. A partial characterization of JHDK from whole-body homogenates of D. melanogaster indicates that it is similar to the enzyme in M. sexta, with the exception of its subunit structure. The active D. melanogaster JHDK is a monomer of ~20 kDa, while the active \"M. sexta\" (GenBank accession number: AJ430670) and \"B. mori\" JHDKs (GenBank accession number: AY363308) are composed of two identical 20 kDa subunits. Similarities in chromatographic properties, isoelectric point, and enzyme activity led to conclude that sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein 2 (dSCP2) is the probable \"D. melanogaster\" homologue of M. sexta JHDK. The \"M. sexta\" gene codes for an enzyme that has 59% sequence identity and >80% similarity to dSCP2 of \"D. melanogaster\" (GenBank accession number: AF093240; CG14904). Li et al. reported that the \"B. mori\" JHDK is composed of a single exon of 637 bp. The \"B. mori\" JHDK is expressed most prevalently in the gut, as determined by Northern blot analyses, and is not under the direct control of JH at the transcriptional level. Maxwell et al. generated a 3D model that they used for in silico docking simulations. This model is shown in the attached figure . They capitalized on the facts that the catalytic site of JHDK must contain a purine (GTP) binding site and hydrophobic pocket for JH diol, and that the scaffolding for dSCP2 is known. Surrounding the putative substrate-binding site, both the \"M. sexta\" and \"D. melanogaster\" JHDKs contain the three conserved nucleotide-binding elements common to nucleotide binding proteins. The model further demonstrates that the protein contains four domains that form two pairs of a helix-loop-helix motif (EF-hand;. Charge interactions in the hydrophobic binding pocket, as well as its depth (19 \u00c2), are complementary to the extended conformation of the diol. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket complements the C1 ester of the substrate and supports the observation that JH diol is the only substrate for this enzyme.",
