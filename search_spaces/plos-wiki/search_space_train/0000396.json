Four of the cases experienced mild hemorrhagic (bleeding) symptoms, which had not previously been described in Mayaro virus disease.

These typically occur two to twelve days after exposure. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, and a rash. Most people are better within a week; however, occasionally the joint pain may last for months. The risk of death is around 1 in 1,000. The very young, old, and those with other health problems are at risk of more severe disease. The virus is spread between people by two types of mosquitos: \"Aedes albopictus\" and \"Aedes aegypti\". They mainly bite during the day. The virus may circulate within a number of animals including birds and rodents. Diagnosis is by either testing the blood for the virus's RNA or antibodies to the virus. The symptoms can be mistaken for those of dengue fever and Zika fever. After a single infection it is believed most people become immune. The best means of prevention is overall mosquito control and the avoidance of bites in areas where the disease is common. This may be partly achieved by decreasing mosquitoes' access to water and with the use of insect repellent and mosquito nets. There is no vaccine and no specific treatment as of 2016. Recommendations include rest, fluids, and medications to help with fever and joint pain. While the disease typically occurs in Africa and Asia, outbreaks have been reported in Europe and the Americas since the 2000s. In 2014 more than a million suspected cases occurred. In 2014 it was occurring in Florida in the continental United States but as of 2016 there was no further locally acquired cases. The disease was first identified in 1952 in Tanzania. The term is from the Kimakonde language and means \"to become contorted\".",

The mechanism by which \"Wolbachia\" is inherited through maternal heredity is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. This changes the gamete cells of males and females, making some individuals unable to mate with each other. Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists, \"Wolbachia\" infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a population exposed to \"Wolbachia\" transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations. This is called population replacement, where the population\u2019s overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype. This shows how populations of Asian tiger mosquitoes can vary in number of \"Wolbachia\"-infected individuals, based on how often the infection is transmitted.

In populations affected by \"Wolbachia\", females commonly compete for the right to mate with males. This is one of the ways in which \"Wolbachia\" infections can lead to speciation, because females evolve traits that allow them to better compete for males. In extreme cases, the feminizing effect of \"Wolbachia\" can cause the host species to lose the chromosome responsible for female gender. \"Wolbachia\" infections are capable of causing the extinction of hosts by making females much more common than males.",

The rate of virus appears significantly higher than in uninfected mosquitoes. Indeed, wAlbB inhibits REL1, which is an activator of the antiviral Toll immune pathway.

They typically bite during the early morning and in the evening, but they may bite and thus spread infection at any time of day. Other \"Aedes\" species that transmit the disease include \"A. albopictus\", \"A. polynesiensis\" and \"A. scutellaris\". Humans are the primary host of the virus, but it also circulates in nonhuman primates. An infection can be acquired via a single bite. A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever, during the initial 2- to 10-day febrile period, becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut. About 8\u201310 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's salivary glands and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life. \"Aedes aegypti\" is particularly involved, as it prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers, to live in close proximity to humans, and to feed on people rather than other vertebrates.",

Those traps that catch other species of mosquitoes do not catch tiger mosquitoes efficiently. A form of an ovitrap called a lethal ovitrap mimics the breeding site for \"Ae. albopictus\" just like the monitoring tool, but it has the added benefit of contained chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control \"Aedes\" mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of \"Ae. albopictus\". This device, with the help of a ventilator, produces an upward air current of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and smell of a human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult tiger mosquitoes, and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting tiger mosquitoes was reduced in places where traps were installed.",

However, the bacterium, \"Wolbachia\", has evolved with this species of wasp through vertical transfer to induce irreversible thelytokous reproduction of only female offspring. When \"M. uniraptor\" females receive experimentally administered antibiotics, such as rifampicin, the strains of \"Wolbachia\" become eradicated, and the females should hypothetically be able to produce both male and female offspring since the bacteria are not present to induce thelytoky. However, the resulting male offspring of these experiments do not carry viable sperm. This implies that \"Wolbachia\" establishes itself early in the females in order to ensure its transfer into further hosts, at the risk of removing the current host's ability to sexually reproduce by not allowing it to produce fertile, viable male offspring. There are three primary reasons for why \"M. uniraptor\" has become so dependent on \"Wolbachia\" for survival and reproduction. The males of the species no longer produce viable sperm for sexual reproduction, and the females do not respond to any cues or advances by the males for sexual reproduction. Finally, the females lose a major muscle in their spermathecae that allow them to contain sperm after sexual reproduction. Therefore, without the symbiotic relationship between \"Wolbachia\" and \"M. uniraptor\", the wasp species would not persist alone by means of sexual reproduction because of these evolutionary alterations that increase the fitness of the persisting relationship with the bacteria. The bacteria have seemingly inhibited the wasps' reproductive pathways through selective pressures to increase the fitness of their relationship, and the wasp is unlikely to regress to its former state of sexual reproduction as a result of these genetic alterations. \"Muscidifurax uniraptor\" now holds an endosymbiotic relationship with \"Wolbachia\", and it has evolved to depend on these bacteria for reproduction and survival which results in the successful relationship we currently observe.",
