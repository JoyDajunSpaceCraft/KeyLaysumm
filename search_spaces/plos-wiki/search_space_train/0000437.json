In addition to Tax's ability to promote the transcription of viral proteins in the nucleus, it also regulates many human genes. It does this by modulating the activity of several signaling pathways such as: CREB/ATF, NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and SRF. Tax modulates cellular processes by protein-protein interaction (binding with proteins), transcriptional activation (promoting the production of proteins) and transcriptional repression (inhibiting the production of proteins). Cellular processes that Tax dysregulates to produce cancerous cells include the cell cycle and the maintenance of genomic integrity. The cell cycle has four stages (G1, S, G2 and M) and Tax is known to accelerate the transition between G1 and S phase. Two DNA repair pathways (base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair) are affected by Tax, leading to mutations in DNA; a classical hallmark of cancer. Tax also causes aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome numbers), which is a possible cause of transformation (normal cells becoming cancer cells). Many proteins are involved in these processes, including cyclins and cell cycle checkpoint proteins (p53 and Rb).

HTLV-1 is an abbreviation for \"human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1\", also called human T-cell leukemia type 1, a virus that has been implicated in several kinds of diseases, including HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, and as a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).HTLV-1 has six reported subtypes (subtypes A to F). The great majority of infections are caused by the cosmopolitan subtype A. HTLV was discovered by Robert Gallo and colleagues in 1980. Between 1 in 20 and 1 in 25 infected people are thought to develop cancer as a result of the virus. HTLV-1 infection is thought to spread only through dividing cells since reverse transcriptase generates proviral DNA from genomic viral RNA, and the provirus is integrated into the host genome by viral integrase after transmission. Therefore, the quantification of provirus reflects the number of HTLV-1-infected cells. So, an increase in numbers of HTLV-1-infected cells using cell division, by actions of accessory viral genes, especially Tax, may provide an enhancement of infectivity Tax expression induces proliferation, inhibits the apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected cells and, conversely, evokes the host immune response, including cytotoxic T cells, to kill virus-infected cells.

This activation facilitates the three key stages of the viral life cycle: entry to the cell; reverse transcription and proviral transcription. Chemokine receptors are vital for the entry of HIV into cells. The expression of these receptors is inducible by immune activation caused through infection or immunization, thus augmenting the number of cells that are able to be infected by HIV-1. Both reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome and the rate of transcription of proviral DNA rely upon the activation state of the cell and are less likely to be successful in quiescent cells. In activated cells there is an increase in the cytoplasmic concentrations of mediators required for reverse transcription of the HIV genome. Activated cells also release IFN-alpha which acts on an autocrine and paracrine loop that up-regulates the levels of physiologically active NF-kappa B which activates host cell genes as well as the HIV-1 LTR. The impact of co-infections by micro-organisms such as \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" can be important in disease progression, particularly for those who have a high prevalence of chronic and recurrent acute infections and poor access to medical care. Often, survival depends upon the initial AIDS-defining illness. Co-infection with DNA viruses such as HTLV-1, herpes simplex virus-2, varicella zoster virus and cytomegalovirus may enhance proviral DNA transcription and thus viral load as they may encode proteins that are able to trans-activate the expression of the HIV-1 pro-viral DNA. Frequent exposure to helminth infections, which are endemic in Africa, activates individual immune systems, thereby shifting the cytokine balance away from an initial Th1 cell response against viruses and bacteria which would occur in the uninfected person to a less protective T helper 0/2-type response. HIV-1 also promotes a Th1 to Th0 shift and replicates preferentially in Th2 and Th0 cells. This makes the host more susceptible to and less able to cope with infection with HIV-1, viruses and some types of bacteria.

PKC-\u03b8 is important in the signal pathway integrating signals from TCR and CD28 receptors. A junction between an APC (an antigen presenting cell) and a T cell through their TCR and MHC receptors forms an immunological synapse. The active PKC-\u03b8 is localized in immunological synapse of T cells between the cSMAC (central supramolecular activation cluster containing TCR) and pSMAC (peripheral supramolecular activation cluster containing LFA-1 and ICAM-1). In regulatory T cells, PKC-\u03b8 is depleted depleted from the region of immunological synapse, whereas in effector T cells, PKC \u03b8 is present. As a result of costimulation by CD28 and TCR, PKC-\u03b8 is sumoylated by SUMO1 predominantly on the sites Lys325 and Lys506. Sumoylation is important because of forming of the immunological synapse. Subsequently, PKC-\u03b8 phosphorylates SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related, proline alanine-rich kinase) that activates the transcription factor AP-1 (activating protein-1). PKC-\u03b8 also initiates the assembly of proteins Carma-1, Bcl-10 and Malt-1 by phosphorylation of Carma-1.

            "document": "NF-\u03baB . In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB), which are proteins that contain multiple copies of a sequence called ankyrin repeats. By virtue of their ankyrin repeat domains, the I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of NF-\u03baB proteins and keep them sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. I\u03baBs are a family of related proteins that have an N-terminal regulatory domain, followed by six or more ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain near their C terminus. Although the I\u03baB family consists of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and Bcl-3, the best-studied and major I\u03baB protein is I\u03baB\u03b1. Due to the presence of ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal halves, p105 and p100 also function as I\u03baB proteins. The c-terminal half of p100, that is often referred to as I\u03baB\u03b4, also functions as an inhibitor. I\u03baB\u03b4 degradation in response to developmental stimuli, such as those transduced through LT\u03b2R, potentiate NF-\u03baB dimer activation in a NIK dependent non-canonical pathway. Activation of the NF-\u03baB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of I\u03baB proteins. This occurs primarily via activation of a kinase called the I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits and a \"master\" regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) or IKK gamma. When activated by signals, usually coming from the outside of the cell, the I\u03baB kinase phosphorylates two serine residues located in an I\u03baB regulatory domain. When phosphorylated on these serines (e.g., serines 32 and 36 in human I\u03baB\u03b1), the I\u03baB proteins are modified by a process called ubiquitination, which then leads them to be degraded by a cell structure called the proteasome.  With the degradation of I\u03baB, the NF-\u03baB complex is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can 'turn on' the expression of specific genes that have DNA-binding sites for NF-\u03baB nearby. The activation of these genes by NF-\u03baB then leads to the given physiological response, for example, an inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, or cellular proliferation. Translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus can be detected immunocytochemically and measured by laser scanning cytometry. NF-\u03baB turns on expression of its own repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. The newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 then re-inhibits NF-\u03baB and, thus, forms an auto feedback loop, which results in oscillating levels of NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, several viruses, including the AIDS virus HIV, have binding sites for NF-\u03baB that controls the expression of viral genes, which in turn contribute to viral replication or viral pathogenicity. In the case of HIV-1, activation of NF-\u03baB may, at least in part, be involved in activation of the virus from a latent, inactive state. YopP is a factor secreted by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, that prevents the ubiquitination of I\u03baB. This causes this pathogen to effectively inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and thus block the immune response of a human infected with Yersinia.",

Both cell lines overexpress BLT2 receptors compared to the PWR-1E non-malignant human prostate cell line. Treatment with the BLT2 receptor antagonist, Ly255283, caused both cell lines to become apoptotic; furthermore, BLT2 receptor knockdown using interference mRNA caused LNCaP but not PWR-1E cell apoptosis. The effect appears due to the loss of BLT2-induced NOX4 generation, consequential reactive oxygen species-induced NF-\u03baB-activation, and NF-\u03baB-stimulated expression of androgen receptors. 12-HETE also increases the survival of PC-3 cells by helping to maintain high levels of phosphorylated Rb retinoblastoma protein, an effect which reduces the ability of retinoblastoma protein to inhibit the synthesis of DNA and thereby cell division.

Klf5, also known as intestinal enriched Kr\u00fcppel-like factor (IKLF) or basic transcription element binding protein 2 (Bteb2), has been assigned purely transcriptional activation activity but, similar to Klf4, binds p300 which acetylates the first zinc finger conferring a trans-activating function.

Chronic damage leads to the sustained activation of the active PaSC phenotype. Diminished production of MMPs by PaSCs also contributes to the fibrotic phenotype. Other factors may also drive the persistent activated state of PaSCs in the event of pancreatitis. For example, PaSCs express protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), which is cleaved by trypsin to become active. Active PAR-2 then instigates PaSC growth and collagen synthesis. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are recognised by tumour desmoplasia, distinguished by an increase in the connective tissue that surrounds the neoplasm. Activated PaSCs in the tumour desmoplasia of human pancreatic cancers express \u03b1-SMA and co-localise with MRNA encoding pro-collagen \u03b11I. These factors are significant contributors of the ECM proteins that compose the desmoplasia. A symbiotic relationship exists between pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and PaSCs, which leads to an overall increase in the rate of growth of the tumour. For example, culture supernatants from human pancreatic tumour cell lines induce PaSC proliferation and the production of ECM proteins. Pancreatic tumour cells stimulate the proliferation of PaSCs through the secretion of PDGF, and induce PaSC production of ECM proteins by secreting TGF-\u03b21 and FGF-2. Pancreatic tumour cells and PaSCs operate in a symbiotic relationship in animal studies, however data from human pancreatic tumours is limited. Connective tissue growth factor is involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases and is predominantly found in PaSCs through regulation by TGF-\u03b2. Pancreatic cancer cells also stimulate proliferation, ECM production and TIMP1 production in PaSCs. The production of these factors is regulated by fibroblast growth factor 2, TGF-\u03b21, and PDGF. In addition to cytokine-mediated mechanisms, PaSCs also produce a tumour supportive micro-environment through the production of matri-cellular proteins. The up regulation of matri-cellular proteins such as galectin-1, and tenascin-C is present in the stromal tissues of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Matricellular proteins induce proliferation, migration and production of cytokines, ECM and angiogenic responses in PaSCs, which in turn induce cancer cell proliferation. Matri-cellular proteins may therefore directly contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer through stimulating cancer cell activity. The matricellular protein also facilitates a tumour supportive microenvironment through sustained fibrogenic stellate cell activity. A hypoxic environment in tumours influences pancreatic cancer progression. An oxygen deficient environment concomitantly exists not only in cancer cells but also in surrounding pancreatic stellate cells. The cellular response to hypoxia is mediated by the transcription factor HIF-1, which is a heterodimer protein composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Hypoxia also stimulates nuclear expression of HIF-1\u03b1 followed by the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PaSCs. The induction of HIF-\u03b1 indicates that PaSCs serves as oxygen sensing cells within the pancreas. PaSCs, endothelial cells and other cells involved in the development of pancreatic fibrosis therefore function in coordination with a low oxygen microenvironment. Treatment of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer aims to target the major mechanisms involved in both their activation and proliferation. For example, inhibition of the receptors PDGF, TGF-\u03b2 and angiotensin II in addition to suppression of the intracellular signalling pathways downstream of these receptors is likely to be of therapeutic benefit. In vitro experiments indicate that PaSCs influence the activation and proliferation process for mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, in particular ERK1/2, p38 kinase and JNK. The inhibition of the majority of MAPK pathways leads to a reduction in the activation and proliferation of PaSCs. Anti-fibrosis treatment strategies targeting PaSCs include inhibition of the activation of quiescent PaSCs. Agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, serine protease inhibitors and adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibit the activation and function of PaSCs. Camostat mesilate, an oral protease inhibitor, that is used to treat patients with chronic pancreatitis inhibited the proliferation and MCP-1 production in PaSCs in vitro. The success and effect of anti-fibrosis therapies in pancreatic cancer treatment, however, remains unclear. Rat PaSCs express COX-2 when stimulated with TGF beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) and other cytokines. pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 and inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway decreases the expression of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA and collagen I, indicating that COX-2 may be a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Strategies aimed at inducing PaSC transformation from an activated to a quiescent state and inducing PaSC apoptosis may also be used to treat pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. For example, the administration of vitamin A induces culture activated rat PaSCs to trans-differentiate to a quiescent state, preventing the progression of pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis.",

By down regulating cell surface expression of CD4 and Lck, Nef creates a narrow TCR response which likely optimizes HIV-1 viral production and generates a susceptible population of cells to further infect. Nef retargets kinase-active Lck away from the plasma membrane to early and recycling endosomes (RE) as well as the Trans-Golgi network (TGN). RE/TGN associated Lck sub-populations in Nef expressing cells are in the catalytically active conformation and thus signaling competent. While TCR signaling takes place at the plasma membrane (PM), activation of the Ras-GTPase takes place in intracellular compartments including the Golgi apparatus. Nef induced enrichment of active Lck in these compartments results in an increase of localized RAS activity and enhanced activation of Erk kinase and the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2).

EP is classified as a relaxant type of prostaglandin receptor based on its ability, upon activation, to relax the contraction of certain smooth muscle preparations and smooth muscle-containing tissues that have been pre-contracted by stimulation. When bound to PGE or other of its agonists, it mobilizes G proteins containing the Gs alpha subunit (i.e. G\u03b1)-G beta-gammaes (i.e. G) complex. The complex then dissociate into its G\u03b1 and G components which act to regulate cell signaling pathways. In particular, G\u03b1 stimulates adenyl cyclase to raise cellular levels of cAMP; cAMP activates PKA, a kinase which in turn activates signaling molecules, in particular, the transcription factor, CREB. Activated CREB stimulates the expression of genes such as c-fos, somatostatin, and corticotropin-releasing hormone that regulate cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, cellular survival, and angiogenesis. EP activation of G proteins also activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR, ERK, and p38 MARK pathways. Activation of ERK induces expression of EGR1, a transcription factor which controls transcription of genes involved in cellular differentiation and mitogenesis. EP also interacts with Prostaglandin E receptor 4-associated protein (EPRAP) to inhibit phosphorylation of the proteasome protein, p105, thereby suppressing a cells ability to activate nuclear factor kappa B, a transcription factor that controls genes coding for cytokines and other elements that regulate inflammation, cell growth, and cell survival (see NF-\u03baB#Structure). The activation of these pathways lead to variety of different types of functional responses depending on cell type, the pathways available in different cell types, and numerous other factors; EP activation may therefore have diverse effects on cell function depending on these factors.

The dsRBD consists of two tandem copies of a conserved double stranded RNA binding motif, dsRBM1 and dsRBM2. PKR is induced by interferon in a latent state. Binding to dsRNA is believed to activate PKR by inducing dimerization and subsequent auto-phosphorylation reactions. In situations of viral infection, the dsRNA created by viral replication and gene expression binds to the N-terminal domain, activating the protein.

In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB), which are proteins that contain multiple copies of a sequence called ankyrin repeats. By virtue of their ankyrin repeat domains, the I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of NF-\u03baB proteins and keep them sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. I\u03baBs are a family of related proteins that have an N-terminal regulatory domain, followed by six or more ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain near their C terminus. Although the I\u03baB family consists of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and Bcl-3, the best-studied and major I\u03baB protein is I\u03baB\u03b1. Due to the presence of ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal halves, p105 and p100 also function as I\u03baB proteins. The c-terminal half of p100, that is often referred to as I\u03baB\u03b4, also functions as an inhibitor. I\u03baB\u03b4 degradation in response to developmental stimuli, such as those transduced through LT\u03b2R, potentiate NF-\u03baB dimer activation in a NIK dependent non-canonical pathway. Activation of the NF-\u03baB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of I\u03baB proteins. This occurs primarily via activation of a kinase called the I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits and a \"master\" regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) or IKK gamma. When activated by signals, usually coming from the outside of the cell, the I\u03baB kinase phosphorylates two serine residues located in an I\u03baB regulatory domain. When phosphorylated on these serines (e.g., serines 32 and 36 in human I\u03baB\u03b1), the I\u03baB proteins are modified by a process called ubiquitination, which then leads them to be degraded by a cell structure called the proteasome.  With the degradation of I\u03baB, the NF-\u03baB complex is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can 'turn on' the expression of specific genes that have DNA-binding sites for NF-\u03baB nearby. The activation of these genes by NF-\u03baB then leads to the given physiological response, for example, an inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, or cellular proliferation. Translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus can be detected immunocytochemically and measured by laser scanning cytometry. NF-\u03baB turns on expression of its own repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. The newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 then re-inhibits NF-\u03baB and, thus, forms an auto feedback loop, which results in oscillating levels of NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, several viruses, including the AIDS virus HIV, have binding sites for NF-\u03baB that controls the expression of viral genes, which in turn contribute to viral replication or viral pathogenicity. In the case of HIV-1, activation of NF-\u03baB may, at least in part, be involved in activation of the virus from a latent, inactive state. YopP is a factor secreted by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, that prevents the ubiquitination of I\u03baB. This causes this pathogen to effectively inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and thus block the immune response of a human infected with Yersinia.",

Activation of the canonical, or classical, NF-\u03baB pathway begins in response to stimulation by various pro-inflammatory stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed on the surface of pathogens, or the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-1 (IL-1). Following immune cell stimulation, a signal transduction cascade leads to the activation of the IKK complex, an event characterized by the binding of NEMO to the homologous kinase subunits IKK-\u03b1 and IKK-\u03b2. The IKK complex phosphorylates serine residues (S32 and S36) within the amino-terminal domain of inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB\u03b1) upon activation, consequently leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 releases the prototypical p50-p65 dimer for translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to \u03baB sites and directs NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional activity. NF-\u03baB target genes can be differentiated by their different functional roles within lymphocyte immunoregulation and include positive cell-cycle regulators, anti-apoptotic and survival factors, and pro-inflammatory genes. Collectively, activation of these immunoregulatory factors promotes lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation, growth, and survival.",

In addition to Tax's ability to promote the transcription of viral proteins in the nucleus, it also regulates many human genes. It does this by modulating the activity of several signaling pathways such as: CREB/ATF, NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and SRF. Tax modulates cellular processes by protein-protein interaction (binding with proteins), transcriptional activation (promoting the production of proteins) and transcriptional repression (inhibiting the production of proteins). Cellular processes that Tax dysregulates to produce cancerous cells include the cell cycle and the maintenance of genomic integrity. The cell cycle has four stages (G1, S, G2 and M) and Tax is known to accelerate the transition between G1 and S phase. Two DNA repair pathways (base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair) are affected by Tax, leading to mutations in DNA; a classical hallmark of cancer. Tax also causes aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome numbers), which is a possible cause of transformation (normal cells becoming cancer cells). Many proteins are involved in these processes, including cyclins and cell cycle checkpoint proteins (p53 and Rb).

Because NF-\u03baB controls many genes involved in inflammation, it is not surprising that NF-\u03baB is found to be chronically active in many inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, sepsis, gastritis, asthma, atherosclerosis and others. It is important to note though, that elevation of some NF-\u03baB activators, such as osteoprotegerin (OPG), are associated with elevated mortality, especially from cardiovascular diseases. Elevated NF-\u03baB has also been associated with schizophrenia. Recently, NF-\u03baB activation has been suggested as a possible molecular mechanism for the catabolic effects of cigarette smoke in skeletal muscle and sarcopenia. Research has shown that during inflammation the function of a cell depends on signals it activates in response to contact with adjacent cells and to combinations of hormones, especially cytokines that act on it through specific receptors. A cells\u2019 phenotype within a tissue develops through mutual stimulation of feedback signals that coordinate its function with other cells; this is especially evident during reprogramming of cell function when a tissue is exposed to inflammation, because cells alter their phenotype, and gradually express combinations of genes that prepare the tissue for regeneration after the cause of inflammation is removed. Particularly important are feedback responses that develop between tissue resident cells, and circulating cells of the immune system. Fidelity of feedback responses between diverse cell types and the immune system depends on the integrity of mechanisms that limit the range of genes activated by NF-\u03baB, allowing only expression of genes which contribute to an effective immune response and subsequently, a complete restoration of tissue function after resolution of inflammation. In cancer, mechanisms that regulate gene expression in response to inflammatory stimuli are altered to the point that a cell ceases to link its survival with the mechanisms that coordinate its phenotype and its function with the rest of the tissue. This is often evident in severely compromised regulation of NF-\u03baB activity, which allows cancer cells to express abnormal cohorts of NF-\u03baB target genes. This results in not only the cancer cells functioning abnormally: cells of surrounding tissue alter their function and cease to support the organism exclusively. Additionally, several types of cells in the microenvironment of cancer may change their phenotypes to support cancer growth. Inflammation, therefore, is a process that tests the fidelity of tissue components because the process that leads to tissue regeneration requires coordination of gene expression between diverse cell types.",

Since microbial lipopolysaccharide (an agonist of TLR4) activates a chain of events that lead to the stimulation of the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors, it was hypothesized that endotoxin activation of \"MIR155HG\" may be mediated by those transcription factors. Indeed, \"MIR155HG\" expression was found to be activated in LPS treated murine macrophage cells (i.e. Raw264.7) by an NF-\u03baB-mediated mechanism.

Subsequent to NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation, RELA undergoes site-specific post-translational modifications to further enhance the NF-\u03baB function as a transcription factor. RELA can either be phosphorylated in the RHD region or the TAD region, attracting different interaction partners. Triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), protein kinase A (PKA) specifically phosphorylates serine 276 in the RHD domain in the cytoplasm, controlling NF-\u03baB DNA-binding and oligomerization. On the other hand, mitogen and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) are also able to phosphorylate RELA at residue 276 under TNF\u03b1 induction in the nucleus, increasing NF-\u03baB response at the transcriptional level. Phosphorylation of serine 311 by protein kinase C zeta type (PKC\u03b6) serves the same purpose. Two residues in the TAD region are targeted by phosphorylation. After IL-1or TNF\u03b1 stimulation, serine 529 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII), while serine 536 is phosphorylated by I\u03baB kinases (IKKs). In response to DNA damage, ribosomal subunit kinase-1 (RSK1) also has the ability to phosphorylate RELA at serine 536 in a p53-dependent manner. A couple of other kinases are also able to phosphorylate RELA at different conditions, including glycogen-synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), AKT/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and NF-\u03baB activating kinase (NAK, i.e. TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and TRAF2-associated kinase (T2K)). The fact that RELA can be modified by a collection of kinases via phosphorylation at different sites/regions within the protein under different stimulations might suggest a synergistic effect of these modifications.  Phosphorylation at these sites enhances NF-\u03baB transcriptional response via tightened binding to transcription coactivators. For example, CBP and p300 binding to RELA are enhanced when serine 276 or 311 is phosphorylated. Status of several phosphorylation sites determines RELA stability mediated by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Cell-type-specific phosphorylation is also observed for RELA. Multiple-site phosphorylation is common in endothelial cells, and different cell types may contain different stimuli, leading to targeted phosphorylation of RELA by different kinases. For instance, IKK2 is found to be mainly responsible for phosphorylating serine 536 in monocytes and macrophages, or in CD40 receptor binding in hepatic stellate cells.

Activation of signaling pathways such as NF-\u03baB ultimately leads to various cellular fates, including cell proliferation and cell death. After LT-\u03b2 receptor activation, IKK-\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are produced, which increases degradation of I-\u03baB, an inhibitor or NF-kB, and produce NF-kB1 (p50) and ReIA (p60). The production of NF-kB1 and ReIA increases rates of gene transcription of cytokines and inflammatory-inducing molecules.",

Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bad (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bad to interact with the 14-3-3 scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKK\u03b1, which leads to NF-\u03baB activation and cell survival. Active NF-\u03baB induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. NF-\u03baB has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depending on the stimuli utilized and the cell type.",

In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-\u03baB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-\u03b1, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-\u03baB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.",

Abnormal activity (higher or lower than physiological) of P38 has been implicated in pathological events in several tissues, that include neuronal  bone, lung cardiac and skeletal muscle, red blood cells, and fetal tissues.

This transcription factor is normally regulated from intracellular pathways that integrate signals from the surrounding tissue and the immune system.

In response to IL-1, this protein forms a kinase complex including TRAF6, MAP3K7P1/TAB1 and MAP3K7P2/TAB2; this complex is required for the activation of nuclear factor kappa B. This kinase can also activate MAPK8/JNK, MAP2K4/MKK4, and thus plays a role in the cell response to environmental stresses.
