ChIP-seq uses immunoprecipitation to isolate specific transcription factors bound to DNA fragments. Immunoprecipitation is followed by DNA sequencing, which identifies the genomic regions to which transcription factors bind. HT-SELEX, a similar method, uses random, synthetically generated DNA molecules as bait for transcription factors \"in vitro\". Sequence preferences and binding affinities are characterized based on successful binding interactions between bait molecules and transcription factors. While many unique transcription factor-DNA binding interactions have been characterized using these methods, it is estimated that this described fraction represents fewer than 50% of the transcription factors present in humans.

An example of NGS-based approach called DNase-seq have enabled identification of nucleosome-depleted, or open chromatin regions, which can contain CRM. Computational methods include comparative genomics, clustering of known or predicted TF-binding sites, and supervised machine-learning approaches trained on known CRMs.  All of these methods have proven effective for CRM discovery, but each has its own considerations and limitations, and each is subject to a greater or lesser number of false-positive identifications. In the comparative genomics approach, sequence conservation of non-coding regions can be indicative of enhancers. Sequences from multiple species are aligned, and conserved regions are identified computationally. Identified sequences can then be attached to a reporter gene such as green fluorescent protein or lacZ to determine the \"in vivo\" pattern of gene expression produced by the enhancer when injected into an embryo. mRNA expression of the reporter can be visualized by \"in situ\" hybridization, which provides a more direct measure of enhancer activity, since it is not subjected to the complexities of translation and protein folding. Although much evidence has pointed to sequence conservation for critical developmental enhancers, other work has shown that the function of enhancers can be conserved with little or no primary sequence conservation. For example, the \"RET\" enhancers in humans have very little sequence conservation to those in zebrafish, yet both species' sequences produce nearly identical patterns of reporter gene expression in zebrafish. Similarly, in highly diverged insects (separated by around 350 million years), similar gene expression patterns of several key genes was found to be regulated through similarly constituted CRMs although these CRMs do not show any appreciable sequence conservation detectable by standard sequence alignment methods such as BLAST.",

Recent advances in biotechnology gave rise to many important techniques that are of extremely high genomic resolution and as a result, an increasing number of copy number variations in the genome have been reported. One of these advances involve using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array with around 1 megabase of intervals throughout the entire gene, BACs can also detect copy number variations in rearrangement hotspots allowing for the detection of 119 novel copy number variations. Throughout the past decade or so, high throughput genomic sequencing has revolutionized the field of human genomics and in silico studies have been performed to detect copy number variations in the genome. Reference sequences have been compared to other sequences of interest using fosmids by strictly controlling the fosmid clones to be 40kb. Sequencing end reads would provide adequate information to align the reference sequence to the sequence of interest, and any misalignments are easily noticeable thus concluded to be copy number variations within that region of the clone. This type of detection technique offers a high genomic resolution and precise location of the repeat in the genome, and it can also detect other types of structural variation such as inversions. In addition, another way of detecting copy number variation that can ensure high genomic resolution is using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Since the International HapMap project had begun, common SNPs that occur between four different populations from different continents have been sequenced and located. Due to the abundance of the human SNP data, the direction of detecting copy number variation has changed to utilize these SNPs. Relying on the fact that human recombination is relatively rare and that many recombination events occur in specific regions of the genome known as recombination hotspots, linkage disequilibrium can be used to identify copy number variations. Efforts have been made in associating copy number variations with specific haplotype SNPs by analyzing the linkage disequilibrium, using these associations, one is able to recognize copy number variations in the genome using SNPs as markers. One drawback of this method is that because SNPs in the International HapMap are not optimized for detecting copy number variations, therefore the data is biased towards large copy number variations. Next-generation sequencing has also been used recently to detect copy number variations with high genomic resolutions. Using whole-genome shot-gun sequencing data, assays have been developed to accurately detect and identify regions of duplications. On the other hand, it is very challenging to detect CNVs in targeted sequencing because it is extremely unlikely that breakpoints will occur inside the scant number of regions captured by a gene panel. Thus, soft-clipped reads and discordant reads are unlikely to be found in targeted sequencing. On average, there is about 1 SNP per 800 bit/s, so over a long enough region, B-allele frequencies (BAF) can be used to detect copy number changes. However, in targeted sequencing, there are not enough heterozygous variants within a short region to detect deviations from the expected 50% BAF. Lastly, high resolution microarrays that have copy number probes as well as SNP probes are the gold standard for detecting copy number changes down to 50 kbs with whole genome coverage. Accurately detecting, identifying, and categorizing copy number variations is extremely important because of the complications they bring to DNA sequencing. Traditionally, DNA sequencing relied heavily on sequencing short reads from a large genome and using any overlapping regions of the reads to combine the short reads to form longer reads. This will eventually be mapped together to give the sequence of the entire genome. However, the issues related to copy number variations arise in linking the overlapping regions together. By definition, copy number variation is a region of the genome duplicated a variable number of times in the population and due to the large variation between the number of times portions of the genome are duplicated, when mapping overlapping sequences, it becomes unclear whether or not a region is an overlap or a duplicated region. With all the challenges faced by sequencing to detect copy number variations, high resolution microarrays are the technology of choice.",

ChIA-PET takes advantage of this concept by incorporating linker sequences onto the free ends of the DNA fragments tethered to the protein complexes. In order to build connectivity of the fragments tethered by regulatory complexes, the linker sequences are ligated during nuclear proximity ligation. Therefore, the products of linker-connected ligation can be analyzed by ultra-high-throughput PET sequencing and mapped to the reference genome. Since ChIA-PET is not dependent on specific sites for detection as 3C and 4C are, it allows unbiased, genome-wide de-novo detection of chromatin interactions (Fullwood et al., 2009).",

With the emergence of third-generation sequencing (TGS) some of the limitations from previous methods of sequencing and assembling plant genomes have started to be addressed. This technology is characterized by the parallel sequencing of single molecules of DNA, that results in sequences up to 54 kbp length (PacBio RS 2). In general, long reads from TGS have relatively high error rates (~10% on average) and therefore repeated sequencing of the same DNA fragments is required. The price of such technology is still quite high and therefore is generally used in combination with short reads from NGS. One of the first plant genome that used long-reads from TGS, Pacific Biosciences in combination with short reads from NGS was the genome of Spinach having a genome size estimated at 989 Mb. For this, a 60\u00d7 coverage of the genome was generated, with 20% of the reads larger than 20 kb. Data were assembled using PacBio\u2019s hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP), and showed that long-read assemblies revealed a 63-fold improvement in contig size over an Illumina-only assembly. Another plant genome that was recently published that used long reads in combination with short reads is the improved assembly of the apple genome. In this project a hybrid approach was used, combining different data types from sequencing technologies. The sequences used came from: PacBio RS II, Illumina paired-end reads (PE) and Illumina mate- pair reads (MP). As a first step an assembly from Illumina paired-end reads was performed using a well-known de novo assembly software SOAPdevo. Then using a hybrid assembly pipeline DBG2OLC. the contigs obtained at the first step and the long reads from PacBio were combined. The assembly was then polished with the help of Illumina paired-end reads by mapping them to the contigs using BWA-MEM. By mapping the mate-pair reads on the corrected contigs they scaffold the assembly. Further BioNano (https://bionanogenomics.com/) optical mapping analysis with a total length of 649.7 Mb, were used in the hybrid assembly pipeline together with the scaffolds obtained from the previous step. The resulting scaffolds were anchored to a genetic map constructed from 15,417 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers. For better understanding of the number and diversity of genes that were identified, ribonucleic acid RNA-seq, were used. The resulted genome has a dimension of 643.2 Mb getting closer to the estimated genome size than the previous published assembly and a smaller number of protein-coding- genes.",

Paired-end tags (PET) exist in PET libraries with the intervening DNA absent, that is, a PET \"represents\" a larger fragment of genomic or cDNA by consisting of a short 5' linker sequence, a short 5' sequence tag, a short 3' sequence tag, and a short 3' linker sequence. It was shown conceptually that 13 base pairs are sufficient to map tags uniquely. However, longer sequences are more practical for mapping reads uniquely. The endonucleases (discussed below) used to produce PETs give longer tags (18/20 base pairs and 25/27 base pairs) but sequences of 50\u2013100 base pairs would be optimal for both mapping and cost efficiency. After extracting the PETs from many DNA fragments, they are linked (concatenated) together for efficient sequencing.

Since the tag sequences are short, individual PETs are well suited for next-generation sequencing that has short read lengths and higher throughput.

As well, ChIP-seq suffers from suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios and poor resolution. CUT&RUN-sequencing has the advantage of being a simpler technique with lower costs due to the high signal-to-noise ratio, requiring less depth in sequencing.",

The MeDIP-seq approach, i.e. the coupling of MeDIP with next generation, short-read sequencing technologies such as 454 pyrosequencing or Illumina (Solexa), was first described by Down \"et al.\" in 2008. The high-throughput sequencing of the methylated DNA fragments produces a large number of short reads (36-50bp or 400 bp, depending on the technology). The short reads are aligned to a reference genome using alignment software such as Mapping and Assembly with Quality (Maq), which uses a Bayesian approach, along with base and mapping qualities to model error probabilities for the alignments. The reads can then be extended to represent the ~400 to 700 bp fragments from the sonication step. The coverage of these extended reads can be used to estimate the methylation level of the region. A genome browser such as Ensembl can also be used to visualize the data.",

Regions of the genome where DNA was accessible during the experiment will contain significantly more sequencing reads (since that is where the transposase preferentially acts), and form peaks in the ATAC-seq signal that are detectable with peak calling tools. These regions can be further categorized into the various regulatory element types - promoters, enhancers, insulators , etc.- by integrating further genomic and epigenomic data such as information about histone modifications or evidence for active transcription. Inside the regions where the ATAC-seq signal is enriched, one can also observe sub-regions with depleted signal. These subregions, typically only a few base pairs long, are considered to be \u201cfootprints\u201d of DNA-binding proteins. These proteins will protect the DNA strand from transposase cleavage and will consequently cause a depletion in the signal.",

It employs the use of exonucleases to degrade strands of the protein-bound DNA in the 5'-3' direction to within a small number of nucleotides of the protein binding site. The nucleotides of the exonuclease-treated ends are determined using some combination of DNA sequencing, microarrays, and PCR.

Studies observing the chromatin landscapes of beige adipocytes have found that adipogenesis of these cells results from the formation of cell specific chromatin landscapes, which regulate the transcriptional program and, ultimately, control differentiation.
