RNA-binding proteins (often abbreviated as RBPs) are proteins that bind to the double or single stranded RNA in cells and participate in forming ribonucleoprotein complexes. RBPs contain various structural motifs, such as RNA recognition motif (RRM), dsRNA binding domain, zinc finger and others. They are cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. However, since most mature RNA is exported from the nucleus relatively quickly, most RBPs in the nucleus exist as complexes of protein and pre-mRNA called heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). RBPs have crucial roles in various cellular processes such as: cellular function, transport and localization. They especially play a major role in post-transcriptional control of RNAs, such as: splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stabilization, mRNA localization and translation. Eukaryotic cells encode diverse RBPs, approximately 500 genes, with unique RNA-binding activity and protein\u2013protein interaction. During evolution, the diversity of RBPs greatly increased with the increase in the number of introns. Diversity enabled eukaryotic cells to utilize RNA exons in various arrangements, giving rise to a unique RNP (ribonucleoprotein) for each RNA. Although RBPs have a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation in gene expression, relatively few RBPs have been studied systematically.",

Most eukaryotic pre-mRNA transcripts contain multiple introns and exons. The various possible combinations of 5' and 3' splice sites in a pre-mRNA can lead to different excision and combination of exons while the introns are eliminated from the mature mRNA. Thus, various kinds of mature mRNAs are generated. Alternative splicing takes place in a large protein complex called the spliceosome.

As a result of this close phylogeny, the structure of the conserved functional domains is shared between CRD-BP, ZBP1 and the human IMPs (Figure 2). The conserved KH domains are shared throughout the orthologs and they are able to form dimers which orient the RNA binding regions in a polar opposite manner (Figure 3A). This orientation creates room for each G-X-X-G motif (Figure 3B) of each KH domain to bind its RNA transcript (Figure 3A).

One study involved estrogen receptors and differential splicing. The article entitled, \"Alternative splicing of the human estrogen receptor alpha primary transcript: mechanisms of exon skipping\" by Paola Ferro, Alessandra Forlani, Marco Muselli and Ulrich Pfeffer from the laboratory of Molecular Oncology at National Cancer Research Institute in Genoa, Italy, explains that 1785 nucleotides of the region in the DNA that codes for the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) are spread over a region that holds more than 300,000 nucleotides in the primary transcript. Splicing of this pre-mRNA frequently leads to variants or different kinds of the mRNA lacking one or more exons or regions necessary for coding proteins. These variants have been associated with breast cancer progression. In the life cycle of retroviruses, proviral DNA is incorporated in transcription of the DNA of the cell being infected. Since retroviruses need to change their pre-mRNA into DNA so that this DNA can be integrated within the DNA of the host it is affecting, the formation of that DNA template is a vital step for retrovirus replication. Cell type, the differentiation or changed state of the cell, and the physiological state of the cell, result in a significant change in the availability and activity of certain factors necessary for transcription. These variables create a wide range of viral gene expression. For example, tissue culture cells actively producing infectious virions of avian or murine leukemia viruses (ASLV or MLV) contain such high levels of viral RNA that 5\u201310% of the mRNA in a cell can be of viral origin. This shows that the primary transcripts produced by these retroviruses do not always follow the normal path to protein production and convert back into DNA in order to multiply and expand.",

Indeed, its depletion in the experimental model of \u201ccalcium switch\u201d, which allows the study of Calcium-dependant junction formation, causes delayed tight junction assembly, correlating with a decrease in the Rac1 GTPase activity. The rod domain of the protein is critically involved in this Rac1-dependent regulation of junction assembly, as its overexpression mimicks the effect of paracingulin depletion; by the way, this also suggests that the head domain somehow prevents its action within the full-length protein. The phenotype can be rescued by an increase in Rac1 activity driven by overexpression of the GEF Tiam1, but not by increased RhoA activity. Indeed, paracingulin can interact with and thus recruit Tiam1 to the junction, allowing the local activation of Rac1 Both paracingulin depletion and overexpression experiments also led to the conclusion that it also interacts with and recruits SH3BP1, which is an inactivator of the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 involved in epithelial junction formation in association with the filamentous actin-capping protein CapZ, by controlling actin-driven membrane remodeling. Paracingulin thus really acts as an adaptator for Rho GTPase regulators at the apical junctional region, and possibly at other cellular sites, because of its extra-junctional localization. In addition, cingulin and paracingulin have similar dynamics, partially overlapping subcellular localizations, and distinct interactions with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.",

            "document": "Plasma membrane transformation . The many changes which take place in the uterine epithelium during early pregnancy have been suggested to represent a loss of polarity in these cells and this thought has been extended to suggest further that an epithelial-mesenchymal transition may occur in the cells during this time. These perceptive insights highlight the critical importance of uterine epithelial cells in uterine receptivity and in one sense recall earlier suggestions on events in uterine epithelial cells. These early thoughts on uterine epithelial cells highlighted the apical plasma membrane flattening and led to the term \u2018attachment reaction\u2019 being used to describe some of the membrane changes which occur during early pregnancy. This term was used to apply to those changes in the apical membrane of uterine epithelial cells upon contact with the blastocyst itself, or when opposing uterine epithelial cells came into physical contact at around the same time of early pregnancy in rats and mice. In particular, the term indicated that in those species with an \u2018attachment reaction\u2019, closure of the uterine lumen was involved such that little or no luminal space remained. However, as is now known, considerable change occurs in all compartments of the plasma membrane of uterine epithelial cells and these changes occupy most of early pregnancy in the rat and mouse with long, regular microvilli being converted into short, irregular structures as early as d 3, 2 to 3 days before the blastocyst even enters the uterus. As we have also seen, in a wide diversity of species, there are changes in the apical plasma membrane which have features in common with those seen in rats and mice and in many of these other species, closure of the uterine lumen does not occur.",

In this stage, mammary gland development depends on systemic (and maternal) hormones, but is also under the (local) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). This locally secreted factor gives rise to a series of outside-in and inside-out positive feedback between these two types of cells, so that mammary bud epithelial cells can proliferate and sprout down into the mesenchymal layer until they reach the fat pad to begin the first round of branching. At the same time, the embryonic mesenchymal cells around the epithelial bud receive secreting factors activated by PTHrP, such as BMP4. These mesenchymal cells can transform into a dense, mammary-specific mesenchyme, which later develop into connective tissue with fibrous threads, forming blood vessels and the lymph system. A basement membrane, mainly containing laminin and collagen, formed afterward by differentiated myoepithelial cells, keeps the polarity of this primary duct tree. These components of the extracellular matrix are strong determinants of duct morphogenesis.",

To make the switch, neuroepithelial cells begin downregulating their epithelial features. During neurulation neuroepithelial cells stop expressing occludin, a tight junction protein.

Another tight junction protein, PAR3, remains at the apical side of the cell co-localizing with N-cadherin and keeps the apical face of the neuroepithelial cell intact. In the absence of occludin some polarity is still lost and the neuroepithelial cell gives rise to the radial glial cell.",
