Dr. Mwele Malecela, who chairs the programme, said: \"We are on track to accomplish our goal of elimination by 2020.\" In 2010, the WHO published a detailed progress report on the elimination campaign in which they assert that of the 81 countries with endemic LF, 53 have implemented mass drug administration, and 37 have completed five or more rounds in some areas, though urban areas remain problematic.",

Following the first malaria-control phase from 1955 to 1962, which was mostly focused on malaria surveys, mass administrations were added to vector control measures and improved case management in 10 of China\u2019s 33 provinces. The drugs used in the administrations, mostly chloroquine and piperaquine, were provided free of charge by the central government. The economic reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping, which ultimately put an end to the provision of free health care through the central government and the emergence of resistance against the most widely used antimalarials modified the use of mass drug administrations after 1980. MDAs are now targeted at high-risk populations, specifically non-immune migratory workers who receive repeated courses during the high transmission season. According to government guidelines, piperaquine, chloroquine, or sulfadoxine combined with primaquine can be used for mass administrations. The artemisinin derivatives are not used in mass drug administrations and are reserved for treatment failures. Malaria burden and control measures are shown in Table 1. Between 1990 and 2000 the malaria prevalence dropped from 10.6 to 1.9 / 100,000, the number of reported malaria cases dropped from 117,359 to 24,088 while the number of reported deaths attributable to malaria remained stable. These data, reported to the national government, depend on reporting from health care providers and like all data depending on passive surveillance tend to underestimate the true disease burden. However, there is no reason to think that the level of underreporting has changed over the last decade. Therefore, the proportional reduction in malaria disease burden is likely to be true. Malaria-control measures, including MDA, as well as major ecologic changes during the second half of the last century are likely to have been responsible for the more than 100-fold reduction in malaria burden in China since the initial surveys in 1955. The widespread use of antimalarials has been followed by the emergence of drug resistance especially in regions with high drug use. By 1995 more than 95% of \"P.falciparum\" strains isolated in the South of Yunnan province were found to be resistant to chloroquine, and piperaquine while in the remainder of Yunnan and Hainan province the resistance rates were 85%and 38% respectively.",

It was during this period in the late 1970s that she began studying onchocerciasis (river blindness) after encountering the disease during her travels around the area. She joined a rural women's support group in order to better study the social effects that the disease had on rural communities. She then applied for and received a research grant from the United Nations\u2019 Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) in order to continue her research into river blindness. She then worked for the TDR for several years, where she developed a program for training community workers to treat themselves and others, and keep record books of the treatments. She brought her findings to the WHO, where her studies were replicated. The results from this replication resulted in the founding of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) in 1995. Amazigo joined the APOC as a scientist in 1996. Her work with the APOC built upon her work with the TDR, and resulted in the development of Community-Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI), with ivermectin being the drug that treats onchocerciasis. It is estimated that her CDTI strategy has resulted in the treatment of over 112.4 million people for onchocerciasis, 11 million people for malaria control, and 37 million people for the control of other diseases. Amazigo spent four years as the Chief of the WHO's sustainable drug distribution unit from 2001-2005. She served as the director of the APOC from 2005 until 2011. During this period, she engaged 16 African governments, 14 international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 20 bilateral and multi-lateral donors, and pharmaceutical companies. After retiring from the APOC, she founded the Pan-African Community Initiative on Education and Health (PACIEH) in 2013.",

The next documented use of MDA in sub-Saharan Africa took place in 1948 and 1949 in tea estates in Kericho, Kenya. Ten thousand inhabitants of the tea estates received twice weekly proguanil from April to July 1948. The intervention was supplemented with DDT spraying in March and June of the following year. Before the intervention the mean malaria incidence in July, the peak of the malaria transmission season, was 56 cases per 1000 population. Following the intervention 4 malaria cases were detected in July 1949. The author therefore recommended continuation of twice weekly proguanil prophylaxis on the estates.

The author states that in a control area parasite prevalence rose over the same period to over 50%. It was felt that the MDA was effective in curbing severe malaria epidemics. In the following three years, 1955 to 1957, pyrimethamine administration was replaced with Dieldrin spraying to consolidate malaria control, which makes an assessment of the long-term effect of this MDA impossible.",

After the war in 1991 and in eight months from January to August, had infant and child mortality increased by threefold. The UN economic sanctions against Iraq declared in August 1990 after invasion of Kuwait made it difficult for Iraq to rebuilt and rehabilitate the country's infrastructure. The economic sanctions had also resulted in shortage in medical supplies and equipment such that health services to population were badly affected including the immunization services which put millions of children at risk of infection. In the 1990s many Iraqis, therefore, died from diseases which were treatable or preventable before the sanctions and the war. Iraq's Government agreed to UN terms in 1996 and this resulted in oil for food programme which allowed the country to import humanitarian supplies and equipment. The programme resulted in a modest recover in water and electricity supply, sanitation and health services.",

Endemic diseases, such as sleeping sickness, were all but eliminated through large-scale and persistent campaigns.  In 1925 medical missionary Dr. Arthur Lewis Piper was the first person to use and bring tryparsamide, the Rockefeller Foundation's drug to cure sleeping sickness, to the Congo. The health-care infrastructure expanded steadily throughout the colonial period, with a comparatively high availability of hospital beds relative to the population and with dispensaries set up in the most remote regions. In 1960 the country had a medical infrastructure that far surpassed any other African nation at that time. The Belgian Congo had 3000 health care facilities, of which 380 hospitals. There were 5,34 hospital beds for every 1000 inhabitants (1 for every 187 inhabitants). Great progress was also made in the fight against endemic diseases; the numbers of reported cases of sleeping sickness went from 34.000 cases in 1931 to 1.100 cases in 1959, mainly by eradicating the tsetse fly in densely populated areas. All Europeans and Congolese in the Belgian Congo received vaccinations for polio, measles and yellow fever. Vast disease prevention programmes were rolled out, aimed at eradicating polio, leprosy and tuberculosis.

In 2006, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Deafness was launched in India. The National Programme for Prevention and Control of Deafness is currently running in over 60 districts across India and aims to identify babies with bilateral severe-profound hearing loss by 6 months of age and intervene or initiate rehabilitation by 9 months of age. Under this programme, India follows a two-stage protocol for newborn hearing screening. In an institution-based screening, the programme's goal is to screen every baby born in a hospital or admitted soon after birth using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), specifically transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). If a baby does not pass, then they are re-tested in a month. If the baby does not pass at the re-screen, then they are referred for auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing at the tertiary-level centers. At community-based screenings, the programme's goal is to screen babies who are not born in hospitals. This screening should be carried out using a questionnaire and behavioral testing and is performed when the baby is immunized at 6 weeks of age or older. A trained health care worker at sub center administers immunization and performs the hearing screening. This protocol is repeated at every immunization. If a baby does not pass the screening, then they are referred for an OAE screening at the district hospital. If they do not pass the OAE screening, then they are sent for an ABR evaluation. Once a baby is identified with hearing loss, they are referred for hearing aid fitting and rehabilitation at the district hospital.",

She joined a rural women's support group in order to better study the social effects that the disease had on rural communities. She then applied for and received a research grant from the United Nations\u2019 Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) in order to continue her research into river blindness. She then worked for the TDR for several years, where she developed a program for training community workers to treat themselves and others, and keep record books of the treatments. She brought her findings to the WHO, where her studies were replicated. The results from this replication resulted in the founding of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) in 1995. Amazigo joined the APOC as a scientist in 1996. Her work with the APOC built upon her work with the TDR, and resulted in the development of Community-Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI), with ivermectin being the drug that treats onchocerciasis. It is estimated that her CDTI strategy has resulted in the treatment of over 112.4 million people for onchocerciasis, 11 million people for malaria control, and 37 million people for the control of other diseases.

Only one project, conducted on Aneityum, a small isolated island in the Pacific, succeeded in permanently interrupting transmission using MDA as one of several malaria-control strategies. However, although unable to interrupt transmission, many MDA projects led to a marked reduction in parasite prevalence and probably had a marked also transient effect on malaria-related morbidity and mortality. Most of the early trials used study designs which would now be considered inadequate to provide a definitive answer on study outcome. For example, before-and-after comparisons were used frequently. Such comparisons are especially unreliable for vector-borne diseases which may show marked variations in incidence from season to season as well as from year to year.

The theory is that the killing of massive numbers of microfilaria, some of which may be near the ocular and brain region, can lead to encephalopathy.

Two doses of the 8-aminoquinoline plasmoquine were given weekly to workers and their families in two camps. The prevalences of malaria parasite infections in humans and anopheline mosquitoes before and after treatment were studied. The authors concluded that \u2018the fall in the mosquito infection rate of the two plasmoquine treated camps was so large as to indicate a local disappearance, or at least a great reduction, in gametocyte carriers in the treated population\u2019. No long-term follow up data were provided for this study or most of the trials reported subsequently. The next documented use of MDA in sub-Saharan Africa took place in 1948 and 1949 in tea estates in Kericho, Kenya. Ten thousand inhabitants of the tea estates received twice weekly proguanil from April to July 1948. The intervention was supplemented with DDT spraying in March and June of the following year. Before the intervention the mean malaria incidence in July, the peak of the malaria transmission season, was 56 cases per 1000 population. Following the intervention 4 malaria cases were detected in July 1949. The author therefore recommended continuation of twice weekly proguanil prophylaxis on the estates. The Nandi district of Kenya was the scene of a large MDA in 1953 and 1954. The target population of 83,000 received a single dose of pyrimethamine at the beginning of the malaria season in 1953 and 1954. The coverage was estimated to be around 95%. Before the intervention severe malaria epidemics had been reported in the area. Following the intervention the parasite prevalence dropped from 23% to 2.3%. The author states that in a control area parasite prevalence rose over the same period to over 50%. It was felt that the MDA was effective in curbing severe malaria epidemics. In the following three years, 1955 to 1957, pyrimethamine administration was replaced with Dieldrin spraying to consolidate malaria control, which makes an assessment of the long-term effect of this MDA impossible.",

Prevalence is similar for men and women. The rate of occurrence is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower in the rest of the world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 epidemiological study of the prevalence of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden. Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local founder effect, a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies. Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence. Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century.
