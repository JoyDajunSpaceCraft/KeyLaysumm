The urinary tract or the intestines may be infected. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, it may cause poor growth and learning difficulty. The disease is spread by contact with fresh water contaminated with the parasites. These parasites are released from infected freshwater snails. The disease is especially common among children in developing countries as they are more likely to play in contaminated water. Other high risk groups include farmers, fishermen, and people using unclean water during daily living. It belongs to the group of helminth infections. Diagnosis is by finding eggs of the parasite in a person's urine or stool. It can also be confirmed by finding antibodies against the disease in the blood. Methods to prevent the disease include improving access to clean water and reducing the number of snails. In areas where the disease is common, the medication praziquantel may be given once a year to the entire group. This is done to decrease the number of people infected and, consequently, the spread of the disease. Praziquantel is also the treatment recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for those who are known to be infected. Schistosomiasis affected about 252 million people worldwide in 2015. An estimated 4,400 to 200,000 people die from it each year. The disease is most commonly found in Africa, as well as Asia and South America. Around 700 million people, in more than 70 countries, live in areas where the disease is common. In tropical countries, schistosomiasis is second only to malaria among parasitic diseases with the greatest economic impact. Schistosomiasis is listed as a neglected tropical disease. Many individuals do not experience symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they usually take from four to six weeks from the time of infection. The first symptom of the disease may be a general feeling of illness. Within twelve hours of infection, an individual may complain of a tingling sensation or light rash, commonly referred to as \"swimmer's itch\", due to irritation at the point of entrance. The rash that may develop can mimic scabies and other types of rashes. Other symptoms can occur two to ten weeks later and can include fever, aching, a cough, diarrhea, chills or gland enlargement. These symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis, which does not cause any further symptoms in humans.",

Each of these schistosomes, that are part of the genus \"Bivitellobilharzia\", sit near the base of a branch within the schistosome family that contains mammal-infecting species. This is a fairly new identified endoparasite that was found in 1955 by Mudaliar and Ramanujachari, who first recorded the parasite in India. Researchers collected fecal samples of the Indian rhinoceros and were startled to find \"B. nairi\" eggs.  The morphological characteristics of the egg are a spindle shape with a terminal spine The eggs are characteristically similar to \"schistosome\" eggs. They also share a distinct similarity with the eggs of the elephant blood fluke. Researchers sequenced specific sections of the fluke egg's DNA and found that the elephant blood fluke and the rhinoceros blook fluke matched sequences with each other. This can tell us that both species are hosts to the same parasites. The elephant schistosome is able to infect the Indian Rhinoceros. Elephants and Indian Rhinoceros must share the same physiological structures to be infected by the same \"B. nairi\" parasite. They also share the same habitat making transmission from one animal to next fairly easy.  \"Bivitellobilharzia nairi\", common name the elephant schistosome, is a parasitic trematode that uses the Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\") as a definitive host. Two other hosts may be the Indian elephant and the greater one-horned rhinoceros Once the elephant is infected, it releases schistosome eggs in the feces near a fresh water habitat where it infects the intermediate host, snails.

Once inside the mammal the cercariae will loose its tail during infection and pair with an adult worm to sexually reproduce. Eggs produced in host will be passed in feces to then be deposited in freshwater once again and release the miracidia within. The miracidia will then penetrate the snail host tissue.

Clonorchiasis is endemic in the Far East, especially in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Southern China. Clonorchiasis has been reported in non endemic areas (including the United States). In such cases, the infection follows the ingestion of imported, undercooked or pickled freshwater fish containing metacercariae.",

Most of these various methods try to prevent and control CE by targeting the major risk factors for the disease and the way it is transmitted. For instance, health education programs focused on cystic echinococcosis and its agents, and improved water sanitation attempt to target poor education and poor drinking water sources, which are both risk factors for contracting echinococcosis. Furthermore, since humans often come into contact with \"Echinococcus\" eggs via touching contaminated soil, animal feces and animal hair, another prevention strategy is improved hygiene. In addition to targeting risk factors and transmission, control and prevention strategies of cystic echinococcosis also aim at intervening at certain points of the parasite\u2019s life cycle, in particular, the infection of hosts (i.e. especially dogs) that reside with or near humans. For example, many countries endemic to echinococcosis have implemented programs geared at de-worming dogs and vaccinating dogs and other livestock, such as sheep, that also act as hosts for \"E. granulosus\".",

The first intermediate host is a mollusk (typically a snail), the second intermediate host is a crustacean (typically a crab), and the definitive host is a mammal such as a dog, cat, or a human. The mammal is the definitive host because it is the site where sexual reproduction occurs and adult \"P. skrjabini\" flukes develop. Infection begins when humans consume raw or uncooked crustaceans such as crabs that contain metacercariae of \"P. skrjabini\". \"P. skrjabini\" metacercarie are typically located in the muscles of the crabs's bodies (Zhang et al. 2012). Next, in the animal or human's small intestine, the metacercarie excyst (emerge from a cyst) and travel to the abdomen before ultimately moving into the lungs. There, adult worms begin to grow and develop. \"P. skrjabini\" in humans, however, are known to often fail to make it to the lungs and thus don't reach the stage of adult development. Rather, immature \"P. skrjabini\" parasites stay undeveloped and enter the human host's brain, muscles, and various other subcutaneous tissues, leading to extrapulmonary neurologic and abdominal paragonimiasis. \"P. skrjabini\" trematodes in the mammal produce and fertilize eggs that then exit the host, typically through feces. In water, the eggs hatch and release miracidium that in turn infect a snail. A sporocyst that contains germinal cells forms in the snail's body cavity, and, following asexual reproduction, produces rediae. Rediae produce cercariae (the larval form of the parasite). The cercariae migrate from the snail to a crab, entering either through direct penetration or by the consumption of the snail by the crab. Often, multiple species of \"Paragonimus\" can be found coexisting in one crustacean, suggesting that metacercariae of different species do not compete with each other within the host. The life cycle of \"P. skrjabini\" starts over again as mammals or humans eat the crab.",

The larva then has to infect a snail of the genus \"Oncomelania\" such as species of \"Oncomelania hupensis\" within one or two days. Inside the snail, the larva undergo asexual reproduction through a series of stages called sporocysts. After the asexual reproduction stage cercaria (another free-swimming larva) are generated in large quantities, which then leave (shed into the environment) the snail and must infect a suitable vertebrate host. Once the cercaria penetrates the skin of the host it loses its tail and becomes a schistosomule. The worms then migrate through the circulation ending at the mesenteric veins where they mate and start laying eggs. Each pair deposits around 1500\u20133500 eggs per day in the vessels of the intestinal wall. The eggs infiltrate through the tissues and are passed in the feces.",

            "document": "Fascioloides magna . Since the presence of an intermediate host is essential to the completion of the life cycle, snails occupy the important role in the epidemiology of \"F. magna\". The intermediate hosts of the giant liver fluke belong to the family Lymnaeidae. In North America, a total of 10 lymnaeid snails were reported as intermediate hosts of \"F. magna\". 6 of 10 North American snail species were found naturally infected and the other four were infected only under experimental conditions. In addition, the Australian species \"Austropeplea\" (\"Lymnaea\") \"tomentosa\" was exposed to the North American isolate of \"F. magna\" and the parasite was able to complete its development. The most common North American natural snail hosts of the fluke are \"Fossaria\" (\"Galba\") \"modicella\", \"Stagnicola\" (\"Lymnaea\") \"caperata\" and \"Fossaria\" (\"Galba\") \"bulimoides techella\". In Europe, an intermediate host had not been known until 1960\u2019s. At the beginning, \u015alusarski assumed that \"Lymnaea stagnalis\" could act as an intermediate host of \"F. magna\" in Europe. His assumption, however, has been neither confirmed by positive findings in the field nor by experimental infection. In 1961, Dr. Erhardov\u00e1 described the life cycle of \"F. magna\" based on observations of experimentally and naturally infected snails. She confirmed that \"Galba truncatula\" is an intermediate host of the giant liver fluke in Europe. In later works, the author studied another lymnaeid species in the former Czechoslovakia. However, \"G. truncatula\" was repeatedly confirmed as the only snail host of \"F. magna\". In 1979, Chroustov\u00e1 reported successful experimental infection of \"Stagnicola\" (\"Lymnaea\") \"palustris\" with \"F. magna\". She considered that this species might serve as an intermediate host of the fluke in the environment. Nevertheless, no naturally infected snails were found. Recent studies indicate that another lymnaeid snail, \"Radix peregra\", may be also involved in the transmission of \"F. magna\" in Europe. This opinion is supported by successful experimental infection of \"R. peregra\" in the lab as well as by findings of naturally infected \"R. peregra\" in the environment These findings suggested that the intermediate host spectrum of \"F. magna\" should be, similarly to North America, diverse in Europe. The list of intermediate hosts of \"F. magna\" is presented in following table.",

It is most closely related to the blood fluke \"Bivitellobilharzia loxodontae\", which uses African forest elephants (\"Loxodonta cyclotis\") as a definitive host. Each of these schistosomes, that are part of the genus \"Bivitellobilharzia\", sit near the base of a branch within the schistosome family that contains mammal-infecting species. This is a fairly new identified endoparasite that was found in 1955 by Mudaliar and Ramanujachari, who first recorded the parasite in India. Researchers collected fecal samples of the Indian rhinoceros and were startled to find \"B. nairi\" eggs.  The morphological characteristics of the egg are a spindle shape with a terminal spine The eggs are characteristically similar to \"schistosome\" eggs. They also share a distinct similarity with the eggs of the elephant blood fluke. Researchers sequenced specific sections of the fluke egg's DNA and found that the elephant blood fluke and the rhinoceros blook fluke matched sequences with each other. This can tell us that both species are hosts to the same parasites. The elephant schistosome is able to infect the Indian Rhinoceros. Elephants and Indian Rhinoceros must share the same physiological structures to be infected by the same \"B. nairi\" parasite. They also share the same habitat making transmission from one animal to next fairly easy.  \"Bivitellobilharzia nairi\", common name the elephant schistosome, is a parasitic trematode that uses the Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\") as a definitive host. Two other hosts may be the Indian elephant and the greater one-horned rhinoceros Once the elephant is infected, it releases schistosome eggs in the feces near a fresh water habitat where it infects the intermediate host, snails. The cercariae larval stage of the parasite will be released into freshwater and become free-swimming parasites to then penetrate the hosts' skin. Once inside the mammal the cercariae will loose its tail during infection and pair with an adult worm to sexually reproduce. Eggs produced in host will be passed in feces to then be deposited in freshwater once again and release the miracidia within. The miracidia will then penetrate the snail host tissue. These freshwater snails have been confirmed to be intermediate hosts. So far two intermediate snail genus have been identified; \"Indoplanorbis exustus\" and \"Lymnaea luteola\".",

After penetrating the skin and eventually traveling to the intestines or the urinary tract, the parasite lays eggs and infects those organs. It damages the intestines, bladder, and other organs and can lead to anemia and protein-energy deficiency. Along with malaria, schistosomiasis is one of the most important parasitic co-factors aiding in HIV transmission. Epidemiological data shows schistosome-endemic areas coincide with areas of high HIV prevalence, suggesting that parasitic infections such as schistosomiasis increase risk of HIV transmission.",
