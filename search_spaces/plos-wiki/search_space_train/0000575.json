On July 1, 1946, MCWA became a field station in the State Relations Division of the Bureau of State Services called the Communicable Disease Center (CDC), and expanded its mission to put an emphasis on disease surveillance and control. Mountin's vision was for a center of technical competence for research and training that could quickly and efficiently provide states services in specific operational fields. He envisioned centers of excellence concentrating on environmental issues, communicable disease, and emerging issues of Arctic health, as well as serving as a key resource for state health departments. He secured approval from Congress for CDC, although legislative authorization was unnecessary. Mountin is \"deservedly known as the \u2018father' of this center,\" wrote Dr. Parran, U.S. Surgeon General, in 1952. While some suggested Hollis deserved credit for the creation of CDC, Hollis himself deflected that talk and noted Mountin was the man behind the success of MCWA and its conversion to CDC. The CDC and its around 400 former MCWA employees, mostly engineers and entomologists, occupied MCWA's offices in Atlanta with a budget of $1.6 million. Malaria eradication efforts dominated its initial mission with 59 percent of its staff concentrating on killing mosquitoes. More than 6.5 million homes were eventually sprayed and the CDC's early organization chart was drawn glibly in the shape of a mosquito. While there was progress in the prevention and control of malaria, as well as typhus and yellow fever, Mountin reminded staff CDC was responsible for all communicable diseases. To endure as an agency, Mountin believed CDC had to become a center for epidemiology and he originated the idea for epidemiological intelligence that led to the founding in 1951 of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service. The concept of disease surveillance became crucial to public health practice.",

He secured approval from Congress for CDC, although legislative authorization was unnecessary. Mountin is \"deservedly known as the \u2018father' of this center,\" wrote Dr. Parran, U.S. Surgeon General, in 1952. While some suggested Hollis deserved credit for the creation of CDC, Hollis himself deflected that talk and noted Mountin was the man behind the success of MCWA and its conversion to CDC. The CDC and its around 400 former MCWA employees, mostly engineers and entomologists, occupied MCWA's offices in Atlanta with a budget of $1.6 million. Malaria eradication efforts dominated its initial mission with 59 percent of its staff concentrating on killing mosquitoes. More than 6.5 million homes were eventually sprayed and the CDC's early organization chart was drawn glibly in the shape of a mosquito. While there was progress in the prevention and control of malaria, as well as typhus and yellow fever, Mountin reminded staff CDC was responsible for all communicable diseases. To endure as an agency, Mountin believed CDC had to become a center for epidemiology and he originated the idea for epidemiological intelligence that led to the founding in 1951 of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service.

More than half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of these diseases.",

The 1998 election of Gro Harlem Brundtland as Secretary General, along with a series of reforms, including expansion of the Emerging and other Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control (EMC) Division, has placed WHO in a better position to revitalize itself. Internal oversight and transparency have been expanded, programs and budgets are undergoing closer scrutiny, and management accountability is looming larger. Bruntland has moved quickly to revitalize top management, mostly from outside the organization, including from the private sector. She also strengthened country offices and to make the regional offices more responsive to central direction. WHO is increasing its focus on the fight against resurgent malaria, while a better-funded EMC is expanding efforts to establish a global surveillance and response system in cooperation with UNAIDS, UNICEF, and national entities such as the U.S. CDC, the U.S. DoD, and France's Pasteur Institute. Margaret Chan, the current Director-General, is still being assessed; there were questions about her performance as chief of public health for Hong Kong.",

The geographic prevalence of the disease can be examined by the spread of the Aedes aegypti. Over the last twenty years, there has been a geographic spread of the disease. Dengue incidence rates have risen sharply within urban areas which have recently become endemic hot spots for the disease. The recent spread of Dengue can also be attributed to rapid population growth, increased coagulation in urban areas, and global travel. Without sufficient vector control, the dengue virus has evolved rapidly over time, posing challenges to both government and public health officials.",

Although a strengthened public-health system has accelerated the national tuberculosis control effort, progress in tuberculosis control has also strengthened the public-health system. In terms of policy, the national tuberculosis control program has clear targets and well-defined technical policies based on the DOTS strategy. National and international partners work in a cohesive manner toward the same targets, with the same implementation framework. Other public-health programs are learning from this successful model. In financial terms, funding from different partners is harmonized under one financing plan with clear funding needs and gaps\u2014another model for other programs. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past\u2014when tuberculosis services were not free\u2014and the success in tuberculosis control over the past few years\u2014when tuberculosis services have been free\u2014have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS\u2014e.g., directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs\u2014are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programs. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms of information systems, the tuberculosis program's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programs. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the tuberculosis program leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes. Finally, the model of collaboration between hospitals and CDC facilities provided by the tuberculosis control program is one of the best examples to date of how hospitals should be involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has influenced the development of new policies that involve hospitals in the work of public health.",
