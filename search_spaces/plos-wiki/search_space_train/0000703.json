It is a fastidious, facultative intracellular bacterium which requires cysteine for growth.

When found in nature, \"Franciesella tularensis\" can survive for several weeks at low temperatures in animal carcasses, soil, and water. In laboratory, \"Francisella tularensis\" appears as small rods (0.2 by 0.2\u00a0\u00b5m), and is grown best at 35-37 degrees Celsius. This species was discovered in ground squirrels in Tulare County, California, in 1911; \"Bacterium tularense\" was soon isolated by George Walter McCoy (1876\u20131952) of the US Plague Lab in San Francisco and reported in 1912. In 1922, Dr. Edward Francis (1872\u20131957), a Physician and Medical Researcher from Ohio, discovered that the \"Bacterium Tularense\" was the causative agent for tularemia, after studying several cases of his patients having symptoms of the said disease. Later, Bacterium Tularense would become known as \"Francisella Tularensis\", in honor of the discovery of Dr. Francis. Four subspecies (biovars) of \"F. tularensis\" have been classified.",

The MNR2 gene encodes a protein closely related to the Alr proteins, but includes conserved features that define a distinct subgroup of CorA proteins in fungal genomes, suggesting a distinct role in Mg homeostasis. Like an alr1 mutant, growth of an mnr2 mutant was sensitive to Mg-deficient conditions, but the mnr2 mutant was observed to accumulate more Mg than a wild-type strain under these conditions. These phenotypes suggested that Mnr2 may regulate Mg storage within an intracellular compartment. Consistent with this interpretation, the Mnr2 protein was localized to the membrane of the vacuole, an internal compartment implicated in the storage of excess mineral nutrients by yeast. A direct role of Mnr2 in Mg transport was suggested by the observation that increased Mnr2 expression, which redirected some Mnr2 protein to the cell surface, also suppressed the Mg-requirement of an alr1 alr2 double mutant strain. Interestingly, the mnr2 mutation also altered accumulation of other divalent cations, suggesting this mutation may increase Alr gene expression or protein activity. Recent work supported this model, by showing that Alr1 activity was increased in an mnr2 mutant strain, and that the mutation was associated with induction of Alr1 activity at a higher external Mg concentration than was observed for an Mnr2 wild-type strain. These effects were observed without any change in Alr1 protein accumulation, again indicating that Alr1 activity may be regulated directly by the Mg concentration within the cell.",

Thus, E-MAP studies rely upon strains with intermediate expression levels of these genes. The decreased abundance by messenger RNA perturbation (DAmP) strategy is particularly common for the high-throughput generation of mutants necessary for this kind of analysis and allows for the partial disruption of essential genes without loss of viability. DAmP relies upon the destabilization of mRNA transcripts by integrating an antibiotic selectable marker into the 3\u2019UTR, downstream of the stop codon (figure 2). mRNA\u2019s with 3\u2019 extended transcripts are rapidly targeted for degradation and the result is a downregulation of the gene of interest while it remains under the control of its native promoter.

After some success with this approach\u2014they identified one of the intermediate pigments shortly after another researcher, Adolf Butenandt, beat them to the discovery\u2014Beadle and Tatum switched their focus to an organism that made genetic studies of biochemical traits much easier: the bread mold \"Neurospora crassa\", which had recently been subjected to genetic research by one of Thomas Hunt Morgan's researchers, Carl C. Lingegren. \"Neurospora\" had several advantages: it required a simple growth medium, it grew quickly, and because of the production of ascospores during reproduction it was easy to isolate genetic mutants for analysis. They produced mutations by exposing the fungus to X-rays, and then identified strains that had metabolic defects by varying the growth medium. This work of Beadle and Tatum led almost at once to an important generalization. This was that most mutants unable to grow on minimal medium but able to grow on \u201ccomplete\u201d medium each require addition of only one particular supplement for growth on minimal medium. If the synthesis of a particular nutrient (such as an amino acid or vitamin) was disrupted by mutation, that mutant strain could be grown by adding the necessary nutrient to the medium. This finding suggested that most mutations affected only a single metabolic pathway. Further evidence obtained soon after the initial findings tended to show that generally only a single step in the pathway is blocked. Following their first report of three such \"auxotroph\" mutants in 1941, Beadle and Tatum used this method to create series of related mutants and determined the order in which amino acids and some other metabolites were synthesized in several metabolic pathways. The obvious inference from these experiments was that each gene mutation affects the activity of a single enzyme. This led directly to the one gene\u2013one enzyme hypothesis, which, with certain qualifications and refinements, has remained essentially valid to the present day. As recalled by Horowitz et al., the work of Beadle and Tatum also demonstrated that genes have an essential role in biosyntheses. At the time of the experiments (1941), non-geneticists still generally believed that genes governed only trivial biological traits, such as eye color, and bristle arrangement in fruit flies, while basic biochemistry was determined in the cytoplasm by unknown processes. Also, many respected geneticists thought that gene action was far too complicated to be resolved by any simple experiment.

These mutants were isolated and genetically characterized by Richard Epstein, Antoinette Bolle and Charles Steinberg in 1962 (although publication of their initial findings was delayed for 50 years: see Epstein et al., 2012. A more complete genetic characterization of the amber mutants was described by Epstein et al. in 1964. Another class of conditional lethal mutants, referred to as temperature-sensitive mutants, was obtained by Robert Edgar and Ilga Lielausis. Studies of these two classes of mutants led to considerable insight into numerous fundamental biologic problems. Thus understanding was gained on the functions and interactions of the proteins employed in the machinery of DNA replication, repair and recombination, and on how viruses are assembled from protein and nucleic acid components (molecular morphogenesis). Furthermore, the role of chain terminating codons was elucidated. One noteworthy study was performed by Sydney Brenner and collaborators using amber mutants defective in the gene encoding the major head protein of phage T4.

Gene duplication occurs in a large number of organisms as part of evolution or as the cause or result of disease (as in the case of the amylase genes in humans, and genes in cancer cells respectively). Gene duplication often leads to amplification of their gene products due to transcription and translation of all gene duplicates. Evidence of gene duplication has been observed the inheritance patterns of \"Paramecium tetraurelia\", a common model organism. In one strain of \"P. tetraurelia\", d4-95, a recessive mutant allele of a gene known as pawn-B found in this strain is inherited through gene duplication and amplification between generations, and even self-fertilizations. The inheritance of this allele is the first description of gene duplication and amplification in the micronucleus of ciliates. Additionally, it appears that the duplication of the mutant allele occurred after mutagenesis due to the similarity in nucleotide sequences of different copies of the mutant allele, especially in the coding region. When the d4-95 strain was crossed with a wild-type \"P. tetraurelia\", F2 and later progeny often expressed the phenotype of the pawn-B mutant, despite carrying a wild-type gene at the pawn-B locus. This phenotype was maintained in progeny even after the self-fertilization of theoretical wild-type homozygotes that had been recovered from the cross.  As is the case of other \"Paramecium\", \"P. tetraurelia\" exhibits a number of non-Mendelian modes of inheritance, partially due to the existence of both macro- and micronuclei. In both the macro- and micronucleus of the d4-95 strain of \"P. tetraurelia\" contained many more copies of the mutant gene than in the wild type strain. This occurs due to the ability of most of the extra pawn-B gene copies to be heritable independently from the original pawn-B locus. Additionally, there is evidence that in the development of the macronucleus between generations, there is differential gene duplication of copies of pawn-B which causes variable amplification of the allele \u2013 between four and twelve times \u2013 and heterogeneity between the copies. This duplication leads to amplification of the gene that suppresses the expression of any non-mutant pawn-B loci. Duplication also occurs in the micronucleus, where considerably higher numbers of copies of the pawn-B mutant have been found than the number of copies of the wild-type non-mutant. Additionally, the number of copies can be decreased in progeny by \u201cdiluting\u201d the copies of the mutant allele through backcrossing with the wild-type parent, over multiple generations. As the number of copies of the pawn-B mutant decrease, the progeny eventually return to Mendelian inheritance of the wild-type pawn-B alleles.",

This downmodulation of the immune response requires the IglC protein, though again the contributions of IglC and other genes are unclear. Several other putative virulence genes exist, but have yet to be characterized for function in \"F. tularensis\" pathogenicity.",

            "document": "Magnesium transporter . The MNR2 gene encodes a protein closely related to the Alr proteins, but includes conserved features that define a distinct subgroup of CorA proteins in fungal genomes, suggesting a distinct role in Mg homeostasis. Like an alr1 mutant, growth of an mnr2 mutant was sensitive to Mg-deficient conditions, but the mnr2 mutant was observed to accumulate more Mg than a wild-type strain under these conditions. These phenotypes suggested that Mnr2 may regulate Mg storage within an intracellular compartment. Consistent with this interpretation, the Mnr2 protein was localized to the membrane of the vacuole, an internal compartment implicated in the storage of excess mineral nutrients by yeast. A direct role of Mnr2 in Mg transport was suggested by the observation that increased Mnr2 expression, which redirected some Mnr2 protein to the cell surface, also suppressed the Mg-requirement of an alr1 alr2 double mutant strain. Interestingly, the mnr2 mutation also altered accumulation of other divalent cations, suggesting this mutation may increase Alr gene expression or protein activity. Recent work supported this model, by showing that Alr1 activity was increased in an mnr2 mutant strain, and that the mutation was associated with induction of Alr1 activity at a higher external Mg concentration than was observed for an Mnr2 wild-type strain. These effects were observed without any change in Alr1 protein accumulation, again indicating that Alr1 activity may be regulated directly by the Mg concentration within the cell.",

            "document": "Lactalbumin . The glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system is foremost among the cellular protective mechanisms. Depletion of this small molecule is a common consequence of increased formation of reactive oxygen species during increased cellular activities. This phenomenon can occur in the lymphocytes during the development of the immune response and in the muscular cells during strenuous exercise. It is not surprising that so much research has been done, and is still being done on this small tripeptide molecule. Whey protein concentrate has been shown to represent an effective and safe cysteine donor for GSH replenishment during GSH depletion in immune deficiency states. Cysteine is the crucial limiting amino acid for intracellular GSH synthesis. Animal experiments showed that the concentrates of whey proteins also exhibit anti-carcinogenesis and anticancer activity. They do this via their effect on increasing GSH concentration in relevant tissues, and may have anti-tumor effect on low volume of tumor via stimulation of immunity through the GSH pathway. It is considered that oxygen radical generation is frequently a critical step in carcinogenesis, hence the effect of GSH on free radicals as well as carcinogen detoxification, could be important in inhibiting carcinogenesis induced by a number of different mechanisms. Case reports are presented which strongly suggest an anti-tumor effect of a whey protein dietary supplement in some urogenital cancers. This non toxic dietary intervention, which is not based on the principles of current cancer chemotherapy, will hopefully attract the attention of laboratory and clinical oncologists.",

These effectors are involved in increasing the bacteria's ability to survive inside the host cell. \"L. pneumophila\" encodes for over 330 \"effector\" proteins, which are secreted by the Dot/Icm translocation system to interfere with host cell processes to aid bacterial survival. One key way in which \"L. pneumophila\" uses its effector proteins is to interfere with fusion of the \"Legionella\"-containing vacuole with the host's endosomes, and thus protect against lysis. Knock-out studies of Dot/Icm translocated effectors indicate that they are vital for the intracellular survival of the bacterium, but many individual effector proteins are thought to function redundantly, in that single-effector knock-outs rarely impede intracellular survival. This high number of translocated effector proteins and their redundancy is likely a result of the bacterium having evolved in many different protozoan hosts.",

Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills \"E. coli\" and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane is a frequent target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, such as in the antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by \u2018barrel-stave\u2019, \u2018carpet\u2019 or \u2018toroidal-pore\u2019 mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic. In general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.",

Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently upon infection with intracellular pathogens and is likely to form part of the antimicrobial response. In this process, immune cells recognize foreign danger signals within themselves, release pro-inflammatory cytokines, swell, burst and die. The released cytokines attract other immune cells to fight the infection and contribute to inflammation in the tissue. Pyroptosis promotes the rapid clearance of various bacterial and viral infections by removing intracellular replication niches and enhancing the host's defensive responses. However, in pathogenic chronic diseases, the inflammatory response does not eradicate the primary stimulus, as would normally occur in most cases of infection or injury, and thus a chronic form of inflammation ensues that ultimately contributes to tissue damage. Some examples of pyroptosis include \"Salmonella\"-infected macrophages and abortively HIV-infected T helper cells.",
