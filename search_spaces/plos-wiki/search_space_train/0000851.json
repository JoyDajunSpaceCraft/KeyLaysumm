Precursor proteins will be transported to one of four areas of the mitochondria, which include the outer membrane, inner membrane, intermembrane space, and matrix. All proteins will enter the mitochondria by a translocase on the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM). Some proteins will have an N-terminal targeting signal, and these proteins will be detected and transported into the matrix, where they will then be cleaved and folded. Other proteins may have targeting information in their sequences and will not include an N-terminal signal.

The NRFs, in turn, activate the mitochondrial transcription factor A (tfam), which is directly responsible for transcribing nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. This includes both structural mitochondrial proteins as well as those involved in mtDNA transcription, translation, and repair. PGC- 1\u03b2, a protein that is structurally similar to PGC-1\u03b1, is also involved in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, but differs in that it does not get increased in response to exercise. While there have been significant increases in mitochondria found in tissues where PGC-1\u03b1 is overexpressed, as the cofactor interacts with these key transcription factors, knockout mice with disrupted PGC-1\u03b1 are still viable and show normal mitochondrial abundance. Thus, PGC-1\u03b1 is not required for normal development of mitochondria in mice, but when put under physiological stress, these mice exhibit diminished tolerance compared to mice with normal levels of PGC-1\u03b1. Similarly, in knockout mice with disrupted PGC-1\u03b2, the mice showed mostly normal levels of mitochondrial function with decreased ability to adapt to physiological stress. However, a double knockout experiment of PGC-1\u03b1/\u03b2 created mice that died mostly within 24 hours by defects in mitochondrial maturation of cardiac tissue. These findings suggest that while both PGC-1\u03b1 and PGC- 1\u03b2 do not each solely establish a cell\u2019s ability to perform mitochondrial biogenesis, together they are able to complement each other for optimal mitochondrial maturation and function during periods of physiological stress.",

In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity. Also, naked mole rats, rodents about the size of mice, live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules. Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency. However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis. Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species. Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging. Presently, gene therapy and nutraceutical supplementation are popular areas of ongoing research.

Although commonly depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network in the majority of cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria are found in human liver cells, with about 1000\u20132000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.",

One of these defects has to do with the decreased energy available for cell processes. As muscles are stained with G\u00f6m\u00f6ri trichrome, characteristic ragged red fibers are visible under the microscope. This appearance is due to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria below the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber. These may extend throughout the muscle fiber as the disease severity increases. The mitochondrial aggregates cause the contour of the muscle fiber to become irregular, leading to the \"ragged\" appearance. The diagnosis varies from individual to individual.

KSS is the result of deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that cause a particular constellation of medical signs and symptoms. mtDNA is transmitted exclusively from the mother's ovum. Mitochondrial DNA is composed of 37 genes found in the single circular chromosome measuring 16,569 base pairs in length. Among these, 13 genes encode proteins of the electron transport chain (abbreviated \"ETC\"), 22 encode transfer RNA (tRNA), and two encode the large and small subunits that form ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The 13 proteins involved in the ETC of the mitochondrion are necessary for oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in these proteins results in impaired energy production by mitochondria. This cellular energy deficit manifests most readily in tissues that rely heavily upon aerobic metabolism such as the brain, skeletal and cardiac muscles, sensory organs, and kidneys. This is one factor involved in the presentation of mitochondrial diseases.  There are other factors involved in the manifestation of a mitochondrial disease besides the size and location of a mutation. Mitochondria replicate during each cell division during gestation and throughout life. Because the mutation in mitochondrial disease most often occurs early in gestation in these diseases, only those mitochondria in the mutated lineage are defective. This results in an uneven distribution of dysfunctional mitochondria within each cell, and among different tissues of the body. This describes the term heteroplasmic which is characteristic of mitochondrial diseases including KSS. The distribution of mutated mtDNA in each cell, tissue, and organ, is dependent on when and where the mutation occurs. This may explain why two patients with an identical mutation in mtDNA can present with entirely different phenotypes and in turn different syndromes. A publication in 1992 by Fischel-Ghodsian et al. identified the same 4,977-bp deletion in mtDNA in two patients presenting with two entirely different diseases. One of the patients had characteristic KSS, while the other patient had a very different disease known as Pearson marrow pancreas syndrome. Complicating the matter, in some cases Pearson's syndrome has been shown to progress into KSS later in life. More recent studies have concluded that mtDNA duplications may also play a significant role in determining what phenotype is present. Duplications of mtDNA seem to be characteristic of all cases of KSS and Pearson's syndrome, while they are absent in CPEO.  Deletions of mtDNA in KSS vary in size (1.3\u20138kb), as well as position in the mitochondrial genome. The most common deletion is 4.9kb and spans from position 8469 to position 13147 on the genome. This deletion is present in approximately \u2153 of people with KSS",

Mitochondrial tRNA modification GTPase is thought to catalyze the formation of 5-taurinomethyluridine (\u03c4m(5)U) in the anticodon wobble position of five mitochondrial tRNA. The gene was first discovered yeast where the mutation of the yeast homolog of human GTPBP3, MSS1, is found to elicit respiratory defect in yeast only when the mitochondrial 155 rRNA P(R)454 is present. The latter is equivalent to the human 12 rRNA A1555G mutation which has been found to associate with deafness. Hence GTPBP3 and its yeast homolog function in modification of mitochondrial function. In human, GTPBP3 is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues in multiple transcripts. As a tRNA modification enzyme, it is thought to function to modify codon-anticodon interaction, which is consistent with its modification of the severity of phenotypes in 12S rRNA A1555G mutation..",

            "document": "Conformational proofreading . The ribosome is a complex molecular machine that, in order to synthesize proteins during the translation process, has to decode mRNAs by pairing their codons with matching tRNAs. Decoding is a major determinant of fitness and requires accurate and fast selection of correct tRNAs among many similar competitors. One must have in mind that most binding events are by non-matching (\u201cnon-cognate\u201d) tRNAs and the ribosome needs to reject those as fast as possible in order to vacate the binding site. At the same time, the ribosome should keep the matching tRNAs bound enough time to allow the protein synthesis process ensue. Despite the importance of tRNA decoding, it was unclear until recently whether the modern ribosome, and in particular its \"large conformational changes\" during decoding, are the outcome of adaptation to its task as a decoder or the result of other constraints. Recent study derived the energy landscape that provides optimal discrimination between competing tRNA substrates, and thereby optimal tRNA decoding. The optimal landscape is a symmetric one (see image). The study shows that the measured landscape of the prokaryotic ribosome is indeed \"symmetric\". This model suggests that conformational changes of the ribosome and tRNA during decoding are means to obtain such an optimal tRNA decoder. The fact that both homologous recombination and tRNA decoding utilize \"conformational proofreading\" suggests that this is a generic mechanism that may be utilized broadly by molecular recognition systems.",

RNA polymerase III recognizes two highly conserved downstream promoter sequences: the 5' intragenic control region (5'-ICR, D-control region, or A box), and the 3'-ICR (T-control region or B box) inside tRNA genes. The first promoter begins at +8 of mature tRNAs and the second promoter is located 30-60 nucleotides downstream of the first promoter. The transcription terminates after a stretch of four or more thymidines. Pre-tRNAs undergo extensive modifications inside the nucleus. Some pre-tRNAs contain introns that are spliced, or cut, to form the functional tRNA molecule; in bacteria these self-splice, whereas in eukaryotes and archaea they are removed by tRNA-splicing endonucleases. Eukaryotic pre-tRNA contains bulge-helix-bulge (BHB) structure motif that is important for recognition and precise splicing of tRNA intron by endonucleases. This motif position and structure are evolutionary conserved. However, some organisms, such as unicellular algae have a non-canonical position of BHB-motif as well as 5'- and 3'-ends of the spliced intron sequence.  The 5' sequence is removed by RNase P, whereas the 3' end is removed by the tRNase Z enzyme. A notable exception is in the archaeon \"Nanoarchaeum equitans,\" which does not possess an RNase P enzyme and has a promoter placed such that transcription starts at the 5' end of the mature tRNA. The non-templated 3' CCA tail is added by a nucleotidyl transferase. Before tRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm by Los1/Xpo-t, tRNAs are aminoacylated. The order of the processing events is not conserved. For example, in yeast, the splicing is not carried out in the nucleus but at the cytoplasmic side of mitochondrial membranes.",
