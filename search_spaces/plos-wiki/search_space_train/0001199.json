The McDonald\u2013Kreitman test is a statistical test often used by evolution and population biologists to detect and measure the amount of adaptive evolution within a species by determining whether adaptive evolution has occurred, and the proportion of substitutions that resulted from positive selection (also known as directional selection). To do this, the McDonald\u2013Kreitman test compares the amount of variation within a species (polymorphism) to the divergence between species (substitutions) at two types of sites, neutral and nonneutral. A substitution refers to a nucleotide that is fixed within one species, but a different nucleotide is fixed within a second species at the same base pair of homologous DNA sequences. A site is nonneutral if it is either advantageous or deleterious. The two types of sites can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous within a protein-coding region. In a protein-coding sequence of DNA, a site is synonymous if a point mutation at that site would not change the amino acid, also known as a silent mutation. Because the mutation did not result in a change in the amino acid that was originally coded for by the protein-coding sequence, the phenotype, or the observable trait, of the organism is generally unchanged by the silent mutation. A site in a protein-coding sequence of DNA is nonsynonymous if a point mutation at that site results in a change in the amino acid, resulting in a change in the organism's phenotype. Typically, silent mutations in protein-coding regions are used as the \"control\" in the McDonald\u2013Kreitman test.",

A synonymous substitution (often called a \"silent\" substitution though they are not always silent) is the evolutionary substitution of one base for another in an exon of a gene coding for a protein, such that the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. This is possible because the genetic code is \"degenerate\", meaning that some amino acids are coded for by more than one three-base-pair codon; since some of the codons for a given amino acid differ by just one base pair from others coding for the same amino acid, a mutation that replaces the \"normal\" base by one of the alternatives will result in incorporation of the same amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain when the gene is translated. Synonymous substitutions and mutations affecting noncoding DNA are often considered silent mutations; however, it is not always the case that the mutation is silent. Synonymous mutations can affect transcription, splicing, mRNA transport, and translation, any of which could alter phenotype, rendering the synonymous mutation non-silent. The substrate specificity of the tRNA to the rare codon can affect the timing of translation, and in turn the co-translational folding of the protein. This is reflected in the codon usage bias that is observed in many species. A nonsynonymous substitution results in a change in amino acid that may be arbitrarily further classified as conservative (change to an amino acid with similar physiochemical properties), semi-conservative (e.g. negative to positively charged amino acid), or radical (vastly different amino acid).",

The tumor is a \"dead-end host\" for MCV. Normally, the virus exists as circular episome (or plasmid) within the cell and its DNA is packaged into viral capsids and transmitted to other cells. In tumors, the viral DNA has broken and become integrated into human DNA within the tumor, so that the virus is no longer transmissible. The integrated virus cannot be excised from the host cell and it must replicate as the host cell is replicated. Examination of infected tumors reveals that the majority have a clear monoclonal pattern, indicating that the virus integrated into a single cell before it began its cancerous expansion. For this reason, there is very strong evidence that MCV causes some, but not all, Merkel cell carcinomas. MCV can also be found in healthy tissues from people without Merkel cell carcinoma.

OPV is an attenuated vaccine, produced by the passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at a subphysiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution. Fifty-seven nucleotide substitutions distinguish the attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions are involved in attenuating the Sabin 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site, which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. In 1961, type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, and became the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine. A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic decline in the number of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965, about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much-reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.",

Interestingly, if the lysine at residue 132 in TSST-O is changed to a glutamate, the mutant regains little superantigenicity, but becomes lethal, meaning that the ability to cause TSS results from the glutamate at residue 132.

When an incorrect nucleotide is inserted during replication or transcription of a coding region, it can affect the eventual translation of the sequence into amino acids. Since multiple codons are used for the same amino acids, a change in a single base may still lead to translation of the same amino acid. This phenomenon is referred to as degeneracy and allows for a variety of codon combinations leading to the same amino acid being produced. For example, the codes TCT, TCC, TCA, TCG, AGT, and AGC all code for the amino acid serine. This can be explained by the wobble concept. Francis Crick proposed this theory to explain why specific tRNA molecules could recognize multiple codons. The area of the tRNA that recognizes the codon called the anticodon is able to bind multiple interchangeable bases at its 5' end due to its spatial freedom. A fifth base called inosine can also be substituted on a tRNA and is able to bind with A, U, or C. This flexibility allows for changes in bases in codons leading to translation of the same amino acid. The changing of a base in a codon without the changing of the translated amino acid is called a synonymous mutation. Since the amino acid translated remains the same a synonymous mutation has traditionally been considered a neutral mutation. Some research has suggested that there is bias in selection of base substitution in synonymous mutation. This could be due to selective pressure to improve translation efficiency associated with the most available tRNAs or simply mutational bias. If these mutations influence the rate of translation or an organism\u2019s ability to manufacture protein they may actually influence the fitness of the affected organism.",

Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location.

The lack of an in vitro cell culture system that demonstrated a deficit in replication upon infection with viruses in the absence of Vpr has led to some mystery in the function of Vpr. Recently, there has been experiments on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) using a novel in-vitro infection system. These infected human dendritic cells showed a slower rate of replication when deprived of the Vpr protein in HIV-1 cells. This replication difference occurred in a single round of infection. This was shown to be due to decreased transcriptional output from the integrated HIV viral genome. Using mutational analysis (biochemical identification of mutational changes in a nucleotide sequence), prevention of cell cycle progression into mitosis was shown to be required for LTR-mediated viral expression. These findings suggest that the evolutionarily secured G2 cell cycle arrest function of Vpr (Viral Protein R) is essential for HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, this innovative in-vitro culture system will allow researchers to address mechanisms underlying Vpr-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 replication.",

This results in the X-linked recessive form of the disease wherein the major protein affected is dyskerin. Of the five mutations described by Heiss and colleagues in \"Nature Genetics\", four were single nucleotide polymorphisms all resulting in the change of highly conserved amino acids. One case was an in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of a leucine residue, also conserved in mammals. In three of the cases, the specific amino acids affected (phenylalanine, proline, glycine) are found in the same locus in humans as they are in yeast (\"S. Cerevisiae\") and the brown rat (\"R. Norvegicus\"). This establishes the sequence conservation and importance of dyskerin within the eukaryotes. The relevant nature of dyskerin throughout most species is to catalyze the post-transcriptional pseudouridylation of specific uridines found in non-coding RNAs, such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Cbf5, the yeast analog of human dyskerin, is indeed known to be associated with the processing and maturation of rRNA. In humans this role can be attributed to dyskerin. Thus, the X-linked form of this disease may result in specific issues related to dysfunctional rRNA and perhaps a graver phenotype. Within the vertebrates, as opposed to single celled eukaryotes, dyskerin is a key component of the telomerase RNA component (TERC) in the form of the H/ACA motif. This X-linked variety, like the Nop10 and Nhp2 mutations, demonstrates shortened telomeres as a result of lower TERC concentrations.",

            "document": "Hepatitis A virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) . Uncoated in the cytoplasm, HAV genome initiates translation independent of a 5\u2019 cap in order to synthesize its viral proteins. The secondary structure of the HAV IRES is both necessary and sufficient for the genome to recruit a ribosome and initiate translation. A host cell ribosome recognizes the IRES and will directly enter at the sequence rather than scan from the 5\u2019 end. The HAV genome does not encode for proteins that have host protein shut off abilities. Therefore, the HAV IRES must compete with host cell m7G capped mRNA. Unfortunately, HAV IRES initiation of translation is not as efficient as a typical host cell m7G cap. Although HAV IRES structure has affinity for eIF4F, its affinity is not nearly as high as the host cell\u2019s capped mRNAs. This results in a longer period required until maximum shedding of the virus is reached. This also results in cell death only occurring from host immune responses rather than lysis. Because eIF4F plays an essential role for HAV IRES initiation, it is a target for suppression of IRES. Cleavage of eIF4G, a protein scaffold of eIF4F, by sequence specific proteases 2A protease or L-protease, will result in highly inhibited HAV IRES activity. These proteases are encoded by other members of the \"picornaviridae\" family. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), for example, encodes these proteases to inhibit cellular mRNA translation while allowing for viral RNA to be translated. The requirement of an intact eIF4G for IRES initiation is specific to HAV IRES among other picornaviruses. eIF4E-binding protein I (4E-BP1) will also interfere with the eIF4G protein. 4E-BP1 functions by sequestering eIF4E which, thereby, inhibiting its association with eIF4G and resulting in HAV IRES inactivation (1). Another method to inactivate eIF4F activity is through the effects of the m7GpppG cap analogue, which targets eIF4E and is then able to prevent its association with capped 5\u2019 ends of mRNAs. The exact mechanism in which this cap analogue interferes with IRES is not clear but it is suggested that the binding of this analogue to eIF4E results in a conformational change of eIF4G which is what disrupts eIF4G\u2019s normal function. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a cellular enzyme typically involved in glycolysis. GAPDH is known to bind to the overlapping sites within the stem-loop IIIa within the HAV IRES. The stem-loop IIIa contains a UU nucleotide deletion inside of a 5 nucleotide sequence which enhances the IRES activity. GAPDH effectively binding to this region will destabilize the secondary structure that the IRES forms, suppressing the IRES\u2019s ability to perform the cap-independent translation. A host cell protein found widely and exclusively in eukaryotic cells, La protein binds directly to specific regions on the HAV IRES during mRNA translation as well as RNA replication. In a 2008 study, cytoplasmic La was observed to reduce HAV IRES initiation. However, in 2014, a more recent study demonstrated successful inhibition (in vivo) of La protein as a proposed method for inhibiting the HAV IRES translation and replication, which means that it more than likely plays an integral role in the HAV translation and replication. Amantadine, a tricyclic symmetric amine, is a proven suppressor that specifically inhibits the HAV IRES dependent translation of HAV RNA. A 2005 experiment showed amantadine suppressed HAV IRES translation and did not trigger an interferon response, which indicates promising antiviral usage of amantadine. For influenza A virus, its primary method of action as an antiviral is to prevent the uncoating of viral genome which inhibits the HAV IRES- mediated translation and replication. Amantadine\u2019s effectiveness stems from the IRES location on the 5\u2019NTR region which has a high affinity for antivirals making it an effective target. It was also revealed that the M2 protein of influenza A virus could be another viable target for the potential antiviral .",

Two closely related types of HIV have been identified, HIV-1 and HIV-2. While HIV-2 is spreading in India and West Africa, HIV-1 is more virulent and the number one cause of AIDS worldwide. Though some of the patients have different results in most cases people infected with HIV go on to develop AIDS and ultimately die of opportunistic infections or cancer. Integration to the retroviral genome is critical for gene expression and viral replication. The viral genome is reversely transcribed into the DNA of the infected cell by viral reverse transcriptase, the DNA is then integrated into the host-cell chromosomes with the aid of the viral integrase. RNA transcripts are produced from integrated viral DNA and serve both as mRNAs to direct the synthesis of viral proteins and later as RNA genomes of the new viral particles.Viral particles escape from the cell by budding from the plasma membrane, each enclosed in a membrane envelope.",

This one of the largest resources available for all genomic and genetic studies, it provides a centralized resource for geneticists, molecular biologists and other researchers studying the genomes of our own species and other vertebrates and model disease organisms. Ensembl is one of several well-known genome browsers for the retrieval of genomic-disease information. Ensembl imports variation data from a variety of different sources, Ensembl predicts the effects of variants. For each variation that is mapped to the reference genome, each Ensembl transcript is identified that overlap the variation. Then it uses a rule-based approach to predict the effects that each allele of the variation may have on the transcript. The set of consequence terms, defined by the Sequence Ontology (SO) can be currently assigned to each combination of an allele and a transcript. Each allele of each variation may have a different effect in different transcripts. A variety of different tools are used to predict human mutations in the Ensembl database, one of the most widely used is SIFT, that predicts whether an amino acid substitution is likely to affect protein function based on sequence homology and the physic-chemical similarity between the alternate amino acids. The data provided for each amino acid substitution is a score and a qualitative prediction (either 'tolerated' or 'deleterious'). The score is the normalized probability that the amino acid change is tolerated so scores near 0 are more likely to be deleterious. The qualitative prediction is derived from this score such that substitutions with a score < 0.05 are called 'deleterious' and all others are called 'tolerated'.SIFT can be applied to naturally occurring nonsynonymous polymorphisms and laboratory-induced missense mutations, that will lead to build relationships in phenotype characteristics, proteomics and genomics",

LCMV is already identified as the best model to examine the difference between acute and viral infection in its natural host \"Mus musculus\", the common house mouse. Conveniently, the mouse is also the most widely used genetic model for mammalian genetics. A major phenotypic difference results from only two nucleotide differences between acute LCMV, also known as Armstrong LCMV, and one of its variant, Clone 13, which leads to persistent LCMV infection. One of the nucleotide mutations is in the process of glycoprotein formation and affects tropism. The second base pair mutation affects the polymerase which influences replicative capacity. The mechanism of these mutations and how they confer such a profound physiological difference, acute versus chronic LCMV infection is yet to be understood.",

Viruses are parasitic in nature and cannot proliferate on their own. Therefore, they must infect another organism and effectively hijack cellular machinery to complete their life cycle. The first stage of the viral life cycle is called viral entry. This defines the manner in which a virus infects a new host cell. In nature, neurotropic viruses are usually transmitted through bites or scratches, as in the case of Rabies virus or certain strains of Herpesviruses. In tracing studies, this step occurs artificially, typically through the use of a syringe. The next stage of the viral life cycle is called viral replication. During this stage, the virus takes over the host cell's machinery to cause the cell to create more viral proteins and assemble more viruses. Once the cell has produced a sufficient number of viruses, the virus enters the viral shedding stage. During this stage, viruses leave the original host cell in search of a new host. In the case of neurotropic viruses, this transmission typically occurs at the synapse. Viruses can jump across the relatively short space from one neuron to the next. This trait is what makes viruses so useful in tracer studies. Once the virus enters the next cell, the cycle begins anew. The original host cell begins to degrade after the shedding stage. In tracer studies, this is the reason the timing must be tightly controlled. If the virus is allowed to spread too far, the original microcircuitry of interest is degraded and no useful information can be retrieved. Typically, viruses can infect only a small number of organisms, and even then only a specific cell type within the body. The specificity of a particular virus for a specific tissue is known as its tropism. Viruses in tracer studies are all neurotropic (capable of infecting neurons).",

Foot-and-mouth disease Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe highly contagious viral disease affecting cloven-hooved animals, such as cattle, sheep, and swine. FMD was once worldwide but has been largely controlled in developed nations, and has been eradicated from some regions such as North America and western Europe. The disease was eradicated from the United States in 1929. FMD is endemic in parts of Asia, and most of Africa and the Middle East, but FMD can occur sporadically in typically free areas. The organism causing FMS is an aphthovirus in the family \"Picornaviridae\". There are seven major viral serotypes containing collectively more than 60 strains with occasional new strains arising. Vaccines can provide immunity, but each serotype requires its own specific vaccine. The disease is characterized by vesiculation or blistering of the hooves and oval cavity and on the mammary glands, leading to pain and discomfort, and to depression, anorexia, excessive salivation, lameness, and reluctance to move or stand, and causing production losses. The death loss is minimal, but there is a high rate of illness when a susceptible population is infected, and the disease has severe economic implications in the livestock industries. Because of how quickly FMD can spread, with nearly 100 percent of exposed animals ultimately becoming infected, and the significant economic losses it can cause, FMD is a worldwide concern. There is also concern that the FMD virus could be utilized by a terrorist organization or rogue state to perpetuate a terrorist attack against the United States by targeting the $100 billion/year U.S. livestock industry. In 2001, from February to September, an outbreak of FMD in the United Kingdom caused the slaughter of over 4 million animals of sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs to gain control of the disease. The FMD virus is found in all excretions and secretions of an infected animal. Transmission of the virus can be from contact with an infected animal, a contaminated environment used to house or transport susceptible animals, contaminated materials or fomites, people wearing contaminated clothes or footwear or using contaminated equipment, infected meat or animal products fed raw or improperly cooked to susceptible animals, contact with an infected carcass, and from aerosol spread of virus from an infected animal or property via air currents. Prompt reporting of suspicious signs of FMD to the proper agents (state veterinarians, federal animal disease control officials, or county agricultural agents will enable an investigation, testing, and containment should an outbreak occur. Laboratory testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. Stringent import and cross-border animal movement controls and surveillance are used in protection of FMD free countries. A response effort to eradicate any potential outbreaks include humane destruction of all infected, recovered and FMD-susceptible animals; appropriate disposal of animal carcasses and all animal products; surveillance and tracing of potentially infected or exposed livestock; strict quarantine and controls on movement of livestock, equipment, and vehicles; and, thorough disinfection of premises and all infected material (implements, cars, clothes, etc.).",

The lack of an in vitro cell culture system that demonstrated a deficit in replication upon infection with viruses in the absence of Vpr has led to some mystery in the function of Vpr. Recently, there has been experiments on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) using a novel in-vitro infection system. These infected human dendritic cells showed a slower rate of replication when deprived of the Vpr protein in HIV-1 cells. This replication difference occurred in a single round of infection. This was shown to be due to decreased transcriptional output from the integrated HIV viral genome. Using mutational analysis (biochemical identification of mutational changes in a nucleotide sequence), prevention of cell cycle progression into mitosis was shown to be required for LTR-mediated viral expression. These findings suggest that the evolutionarily secured G2 cell cycle arrest function of Vpr (Viral Protein R) is essential for HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, this innovative in-vitro culture system will allow researchers to address mechanisms underlying Vpr-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 replication.",

Jersey and Guernsey breeds of cattle are particularly susceptible to pox viruses, with symptoms characterised by widespread, unsightly skin lesions. And most people have heard of myxomatosis, which is a fatal pox virus infection of rabbits: once infected they die within twelve days. The virus was deliberately released in Australia in 1950, in an attempt to control the exponentially growing rabbit population. Rabbits had been brought to the continent in 1859 for sport, and having no natural predators, bred at an extraordinary rate. The infection killed 99.8 percent of rabbits, but by the late 1950s, Australian rabbits started to become immune to the virus and the population of rabbits increased, but never to the vast numbers seen before 1950. Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, if not vaccinated, can catch serious viral infections. Canine parvovirus 2 is caused by a small DNA virus, and infections are often fatal in pups. The emergence of the parvovirus in the 1970s was the most significant in the history of infectious diseases. The disease spread rapidly across the world, and thousands of dogs died from the infection. The virus originated in cats, the vector of feline panleukopenia, but a mutation that changed just two amino acids in the viral capsid protein VP2 allowed it to cross the species barrier, and dogs, unlike cats, had no resistance to the disease. Canine distemper virus is closely related to measles virus and is the most important viral disease of dogs. The disease (which was first described in 1760, by Edward Jenner, the pioneer of smallpox vaccination, is highly contagious, but is well controlled by vaccination.

NS2 is phosphorylated by cellular kinases and is an important matrix protein of the granular viral inclusion bodies that form within the cytoplasm of infected cells. These viral inclusion bodies act as the centres of viral replication. The membrane glycoproteins NS3 and NS3a are expressed in large amounts in insect cells but not in mammalian cells. They are involved in the release of progeny virus particles from infected cells and may be involved in determination of both vector competence and virulence. Many orbiviruses preferentially infect vascular endothelial cells. Orbiviruses enter the host cell by endocytosis and the outer capsid is subsequently removed. The whole cycle of viral replication takes place within the cytoplasm of the host cell. Transcription of the viral genome into mRNA occurs within the core particle and mRNA is translated into proteins using the host cell ribosomes. Viral proteins are synthesized 2\u201314 days after initial infection. New virons self-assemble within the cytoplasm and are then released from the host cell by budding. During the budding process they transiently acquire a lipid envelope which can be detected for a short period of time following their release but this is subsequently lost. Orbiviruses primarily cause diseases in animals. The different Orbivirus species have different host specificities.
