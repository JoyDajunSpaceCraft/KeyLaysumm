One key way in which \"L. pneumophila\" uses its effector proteins is to interfere with fusion of the \"Legionella\"-containing vacuole with the host's endosomes, and thus protect against lysis. Knock-out studies of Dot/Icm translocated effectors indicate that they are vital for the intracellular survival of the bacterium, but many individual effector proteins are thought to function redundantly, in that single-effector knock-outs rarely impede intracellular survival. This high number of translocated effector proteins and their redundancy is likely a result of the bacterium having evolved in many different protozoan hosts.",

This is repeated a number of times in succession forming a chain of ubiquitin molecules, which is a process referred to as polyubiquitination. The polyubiquitination of the target protein signals the proteasome to break it down, which it does via proteolysis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a crucial role in the non-lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins, and ubiquitin can also participate in modifying proteins to perform certain tasks.

The type II secretion system is a membrane bound protein complex found in Gram-negative bacteria that is used to secrete proteins found in the cytoplasm of the bacteria into the extracellular space outside of the cell. The type II secretion system is just one of many secretory systems found in Gram-negative bacteria and is used to secrete a variety of different proteins, including bacterial toxins and degradative enzymes such as proteases and lipases. These secreted proteins are generally associated with the breakdown of host tissues and therefore are often important in causing the symptoms associated with certain bacterial infections. Each bacterial cell will contain a number of type II secretion systems and these are found embedded in the inner and outer membranes of the cell.",

Intracellular and extracellular signals within the cell highly regulate when and which proteins are tagged with ubiquitin. Once attached to the protein, ubiquitin serves as a signaling molecule to the proteasomes, which then bind to the ubiquinated proteins and degrades them.

RtxA is a virulence factor involved in cholera which facilitates colonization of \"V. cholerae\" the small intestine. RtxA causes destruction of the actin cytoskeleton in host cells through G-actin modification and destruction of Rho GTPases. The toxin contains four functional domains: an actin cross-linking domain (ACD), a Rho-inactivating domain (RID), a cysteine protease domain (CPD), and an \u03b1\u03b2-hydrolase. In \"V. cholerae\" infection, the CPD binds to inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP, Phytic acid) inside eukaryotic host cells. This binding activates the autoproteolytic CPD which cleaves the MARTX protein into smaller independent proteins each containing only one of the effector domains ACD, RID, and \u03b1\u03b2-hydrolase. This allows each effector to act independently within the host cell, this increases the effects of RtxA because the ACD and RID function in different locations within the cell. ACD cross-links monomeric G-actin in the host cell cytosol, preventing formation of actin microfilament, a major component of the cytoskeleton. RID inactivates membrane bound Rho-GTPases, which are regulators of cytoskeleton formation.",

Proteins in this entry are type III secretion system effectors. They are named differently in different species and in \"Yersinia\" has been designated YopR (Yersinia outer protein R) which is encoded by the YscH (Yersinia secretion H) gene. This Yop protein is unusual in that it is released to the extracellular environment rather than injected directly into the target cell as are most Yop proteins. A hallmark of \"Yersinia\" type III machines is the presence of needles extending from the bacterial surface. Needles perform two functions, firstly, as a channel to export effectors into the immune cells and secondly as a sensor.",

After gaining entrance to the host leaves, \"Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea\" multiplies in the leaf intercellular fluid. The pathogen must then overcome the plants defenses. \"Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea\" accomplishes this by using the type three secretion system to inject a variety of pathogenicity effector proteins (Hrp proteins) into the plant cell cytoplasm. These proteins act by interfering with effector-triggered immunity and producing phytohormones/toxins that suppress plant defenses. The expression of these virulence factors depends on the environmental conditions at the time of infection (see \"environment section). Furthermore, expression of virulence factors will only take place when a sufficiently large population of bacteria is present, which is determined through quorum sensing. When successful, the common symptoms of bacterial blight will be seen, with the main effect on the plant being a reduction in photosynthetic leaf area. Generally, the amount of photosynthetic area lost is not enough to impede plant growth. As the plant continues to grow it overcomes the loss of photosynthetic area and reduction in yield, if there is any, is negligible.",
