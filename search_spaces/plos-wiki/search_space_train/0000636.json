The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose, and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever, low red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver. Infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of \"Leishmania\". Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation, and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under the microscope. Additionally, visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests. Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of \"Leishmania\", and the type of infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective. About 4 to 12 million people are currently infected in some 98 countries. About 2 million new cases and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year. About 200\u00a0million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common.

The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose, and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever, low red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver. Infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of \"Leishmania\". Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation, and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under the microscope. Additionally, visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests. Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of \"Leishmania\", and the type of infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective. About 4 to 12 million people are currently infected in some 98 countries. About 2 million new cases and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year. About 200\u00a0million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common.

They independently visualised microscopic single-celled parasites (later called Leishman-Donovan bodies) living within the cells of infected human organs. The parasitic genus would later be classed as Trypanosomatid protozoans under the phylogenetic designation, \"Leishmania donovani\".

The main objectives are as follows: to reduce the chances of becoming infected, and, if infected, to reduce the chances of the infection being transmitted. Educating the general public will help change how the disease is perceived. This could help people better understand risks and allow people to not live in fear of the disease. The high prevalence of some zoonotic helminths could indicate that humans in specific regions such as; the mediterranean area, south of the Sahara in the semi-arid areas of East Africa, South Africa, South America, East Europe and parts of China. These areas are at serious risk of transmission and, if all the preventive measures are not taken, the human infection may spread quickly. Preventive programs, such as elimination of the stray dogs from cities and rural regions, could be necessary in this instance. However, control of wild canids can be difficult, but there are other regulatory measures that can be applied to communities, such as health education and implementing strict regulations of livestock slaughtering in slaughter houses and farms, could reduce the risk of parasite transmission. In addition, it is important for public health authorities, pet owners, physicians and veterinarians in these regions to pay close attention to patients and to remain informed of any possible outbreaks and transmission. In a study conducted at Washington State University, the effects of heat treatment were analyzed on the young forms of Taenia hydatigena. They observed that when the eggs were treated at temperatures of 60 degrees C they did not establish in the hosts. This could be influential in future prevention methods.",

Insects such as flies and mosquitoes have high amounts of breeding grounds and nests of eggs around manure waste, allowing rapid reproduction and fresh vectors for potential disease. Typically with dense populations of livestock, transmission of disease from one animal to another can be on account of insects, such as flies, mosquitoes or ticks, spreading blood from one animal to another. This can be particularly dangerous for sick animals spreading diseases to healthier animals, promoting general malaise in a concentrated area. Additionally, the animals can be infected from other animals' manure making contact with their food. In fact, fecal-oral transmission are one of the largest sources for pathogen transmission. Within concentrated animal farming operations, there is no mandatory testing of novel viruses, only reporting known illnesses to the World Organization for Animal Health. Thus, certain mutations or recombinant bacteria strains, which are more efficient in translation to human to human events, can be unnoticed.",

However, it has been reported to form complexes with human albumin through the formation of binding sites. This ability to bind albumin in humans, in addition to the previously studied binding ability in domesticated animals, provided strong experimental evidence that the disease could be vertically transferred to humans. Medical cases support that humans under certain circumstances can become infected. Such infections may have gone undiscovered in the past due to difficulties in characterizing the biochemical makeup of this pathogen compared to the known human-infecting species such as \"S. dysgalactiae\". An elderly man who owned a dog was admitted to the hospital after exhibiting malaise, fever, and tachycardia, and treated with antibiotics until he recovered. Varicose ulcers present on his legs were later determined to be the points of entry for the disease, transferred from his dog, thus led to his symptoms.  In another case of human infection, an elderly woman was initially admitted to the hospital after slight bruising of her eyebrow, and readmitted a few days later with a high fever. Medical analysis determined her fever was the result of meningitis and sepsis that ultimately led to the death of the patient after antibiotics failed. Additional support for the possibility of \"S. canis\" infections in humans has been provided by multiple cases linking the occurrence of the disease to dog ownership in elderly men. In these cases, all men had a history of ulcers on their lower limbs, which acted as an entry point for the transmission of bacteria from the respiratory tract of the dogs. This history, in combination with continued exposure from household dogs, led to the transfer of the disease and the expression of symptoms that required medical attention.",

African Swine Fever African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease of pigs, endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with no vaccine or treatment available. The ASF virus has spread through Georgia (2007) into Russia, then Ukraine, Belarus, and other Eastern European countries, and as of 2015 reports of outbreaks continue, mainly in wild boar. Mortality can be near-100 percent in some viral strains causing serious viral hemorrhagic disease while others can have more subtle clinical signs and be difficult to identify. \"With high virulent forms of the virus, ASF is characterized by high fever, loss of appetite, hemorrhages in the skin and internal organs, and death in 2-10 days on average. Mortality rates may be as high as 100%.\" The ASF virus can be transmitted directly between animals, indirectly via fomites, or by tick vectors. Wild suids such as Warthogs are important to maintaining the virus present (by a natural cycle of transmission between warthogs and the soft tick vector O moubata in Africa, but the ASF virus can infect domestic pigs, feral swine, and some members of the wild pig family. The bite of an infected soft tick or ingestion of warthog tissues can spread the virus from the wildlife reservoirs to domestic pigs, then spread can be continued to pig to pig by blood, the oronasal route by direct contact with infected pigs, or by ingestion of waste food containing unprocessed pig meat or pig meat products. Other potential routes for spread can be from feeding food waste collected from international airplanes or ships from countries where ASF is found, feral swine movements, the movement of trucks between infected and disease-free areas, and illegal movement of infected pigs or pork products, whether unintentional (e.g., by tourists) or intentional (e.g., meat smuggling). The risk that the ASF virus can be introduced into the US and North America has increased because of changes in production practices, increasing globalization, and outbreaks of ASF in Europe. If the virus were to enter the US, control measures must be initiated to prevent the spread of the virus and eliminate it as quickly as possible, of which the primary control and eradication strategy will be depopulation of infected and exposed susceptible animals.",

However, the pathogen can be horizontally transferred to other domesticated animals from either of these two animals. A documented instance of this transfer occurred on a central New York farm between a cat which was exhibiting chronic sinusitis and a dairy cow. This transfer resulted in \"S. canis\" mastitis on the udder of the cow, which appeared to be normal, leading to a prolonged diagnosis. Additional horizontal disease transfer to other cows in the herd was facilitated due to poor udder health management procedures, which included the use of a common cloth to wipe the udders of the cows following milking and the failure to use disinfection techniques. An outbreak of \"S. canis\" mastitis occurred from these transfers, but was controlled using antibiotic treatments and prevention techniques. Not limited to strains within the United States, instances of bovine mastitis due to \"S. canis\" have been reported in other areas. In both Germany and Israel, similar outbreaks occurred due to horizontal disease transfer from either a domesticated cat or dog, but during the Israel outbreak, the cows were clinically examined to determine the susceptibility of the pathogen to various antibiotics. From this study, the bacteria were found to be sensitive to cephalothin and partially resistant to penicillin.",

Insects such as mosquitoes and flies are by far the most common disease carrier, or vector. These insects may carry a parasite, bacterium or virus that is infectious to humans and animals.

In many insect species, such as \"Drosophila melanogaster\", researchers found that a natural infection with the bacteria strain \"Wolbachia\" \"pipientis\" increases the fitness of the host by increasing resistance to RNA viral infections. Robert L. Glaser and Mark A. Meola investigated \"Wolbachia\"-induced resistance to West Nile virus (WNV) in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" (fruit flies). Two groups of fruit flies were naturally infected with \"Wolbachia.\" Glaser and Meola then cured one group of fruit flies of \"Wolbachia using\" tetracycline. Both the infected group and the cured groups were then infected with WNV. \u00a0Flies infected with \"Wolbachia\" were found to have a changed phenotype that caused resistance to WNV. The phenotype was found to be caused by a \u201cdominant, maternally transmitted, cytoplasmic factor\u201d. The WNV-resistance phenotype was then reversed by curing the fruit flies of \"Wolbachia.\" Since \"Wolbachia\" is also maternally transmitted, it was found that the WNV-resistant phenotype is directly related to the \"Wolbachia\" infection. West Nile virus is transmitted to humans and animals through the Southern house mosquito, \"Culex quinquefasciatus.\" Glaser and Meola knew vector compatibility could be reduced through \"Wolbachia\" infection due to studies done with other species of mosquitoes, mainly, \"Aedes aegypti\". Their goal was to transfer WNV resistance to \"Cx. quinquefasciatus\" by inoculating the embryos of the mosquito with the same strain of \"Wolbachia\" that naturally occurred in the fruit flies. Upon infection, \"Cx. quinquefasciatus\" showed an increased resistance to WNV that was transferable to offspring. The ability to genetically modify mosquitoes in the lab and then have the infected mosquitoes transmit it to their offspring showed that it was possible to transmit the bacteria to wild populations to decrease human infections.",
