Data collected from GPS is passed into a Kalman filter, and other data including velocity and temperature is calculated on the bus and transmitted every 30 seconds via GPRS. With the bus network map, this helps the Central System to make a \"best guess\" of the bus position and depicts the overall image derived from the data provided by all buses, even in areas with poor GPS reception. The Central System can update the countdown signs as before that now has a more accurate prediction derived from all this data. Knowing the location of the bus, controllers have the means to regulate the service more efficiently, and priority can be given to a bus at traffic lights.",

They replicated the Wells Effect but also included manipulations that were meant to make it easier to imagine that a gray bus was responsible. For instance, their \"partial-match/simulation case\" was similar to Wells's \"tire tracks-belief case\", except the witness was cross-examined by the defense and admitted that it was possible that a gray bus caused the accident. The researchers also probed participants with new questions meant to measure the ease of this mental simulation (e.g., \"on an 11-point scale, how easy it was to imagine that a Grey Bus Company bus ran over the dog\"). In these experiments, participants were less likely to make a judgment against the Blue Bus Company in cases where they had an easier time imagining that a gray bus was responsible for the accident, even though they reported an identical probability that a blue bus was responsible.",

These value caches keep track of the data values that have recently been transmitted over the bus. The entries in these caches are constructed in such a way that the contents of both the value caches are the same all the time. When a data value needs to be transmitted over the bus, we first check whether it is in the value cache of the sender (whether it is memory or cache). If it is, we transmit only the index of the data (i.e., its value cache address, or index) instead of the actual data value and, the other side (receiver) can determine the data value by using this index and its value cache.To transmit the data in the value cache using only 1 bit switching activity, the size of value cache is limited to the width of the data bus. That is, with a 32-bit bus, the VC could have only 32 entries. Since the value caches employed by our power protocol are very small, the width of the index value is much smaller than the width of the actual data value. Consequently, fewer off-chip bus lines need to be activated for transmission Our approach tries to achieve the first option by exploiting the locality of the data values communicated over the off-chip data bus. However, once the width of the data (that needs to be transmitted) has been reduced, we can also expect a reduction (in general) on the average bit switching activity per transfer. In addition, this switching activity can be further reduced by using well-known bus encoding schemes in conjunction with our strategy",

Messages consist of one or more 16-bit words (command, data, or status). The 16 bits comprising each word are transmitted using Manchester code, where each bit is transmitted as a 0.5 \u03bcs high and 0.5 \u03bcs low for a logical 1 or a low-high sequence for a logical 0. Each word is preceded by a 3 \u03bcs sync pulse (1.5 \u03bcs low plus 1.5 \u03bcs high for data words and the opposite for command and status words, which cannot occur in the Manchester code) and followed by an odd parity bit.

This is a process in which the CPU die, flash, and DRAM would be stacked on top of each other significantly raising the possible memory bus widths. Another challenge that Intel encountered were the physical limitations of electrical buses. A bus bandwidth is the CPU's connection to the outside world and with the current bus bandwidth, it would be unable to keep up with the teraFLOPs performance resulting from tera-scale processors. Intel's research into Silicon Photonics has produced a functional optical bus that can offer superior signaling speed and power efficiency compared to the current buses.

Bus encoding aims to reduce this power by reducing the amount of activity (number of toggles) in the bus lines.

These value caches keep track of the data values that have recently been transmitted over the bus. The entries in these caches are constructed in such a way that the contents of both the value caches are the same all the time. When a data value needs to be transmitted over the bus, we first check whether it is in the value cache of the sender (whether it is memory or cache). If it is, we transmit only the index of the data (i.e., its value cache address, or index) instead of the actual data value and, the other side (receiver) can determine the data value by using this index and its value cache.To transmit the data in the value cache using only 1 bit switching activity, the size of value cache is limited to the width of the data bus. That is, with a 32-bit bus, the VC could have only 32 entries. Since the value caches employed by our power protocol are very small, the width of the index value is much smaller than the width of the actual data value. Consequently, fewer off-chip bus lines need to be activated for transmission Our approach tries to achieve the first option by exploiting the locality of the data values communicated over the off-chip data bus. However, once the width of the data (that needs to be transmitted) has been reduced, we can also expect a reduction (in general) on the average bit switching activity per transfer. In addition, this switching activity can be further reduced by using well-known bus encoding schemes in conjunction with our strategy",

Due to higher value of load capacitance and activity factor, in a typical system, bus power consumption can contribute up to 50% of the total power consumption. Bus encoding aims to reduce this power by reducing the amount of activity (number of toggles) in the bus lines.

The 6800 architecture was modeled after the DEC PDP-11 processor. Both the 8080 and the 6800 were TTL compatible, had an 8-bit bidirectional data bus, a 16-bit stack pointer, a 16-bit address bus that could address 64\u00a0kB of memory, and came in a 40-pin DIP package. The 6800 had two accumulators and a 16-bit index register. The direct addressing mode allowed fast access to the first 256\u00a0bytes of memory. I/O devices were addressed as memory so there were no special I/O instructions. The 8080 had more internal registers and instructions for dedicated I/O ports. When the 8080 was reset, the program counter was cleared and the processor started at memory location 0000. The 6800 loaded the program counter from the highest address and started at the memory location stored there. The 6800 had a three-state control that would disable the address bus to allow another device direct memory access. A disk controller could therefore transfer data into memory with no load on the processor. It was even possible to have two 6800 processors access the same memory. However, in practice systems of such complexity usually required the use of external bus transceivers to drive the system bus; in such circuits the on-processor bus control was disabled entirely in favor of using the similar capabilities of the bus transceiver. In contrast, the 6802 dispensed with this on-chip control entirely in order to free up pins for other functions in the same 40-pin package as the 6800, but this functionality could still be achieved using an external bus transceiver.",

Messages consist of one or more 16-bit words (command, data, or status). The 16 bits comprising each word are transmitted using Manchester code, where each bit is transmitted as a 0.5 \u03bcs high and 0.5 \u03bcs low for a logical 1 or a low-high sequence for a logical 0. Each word is preceded by a 3 \u03bcs sync pulse (1.5 \u03bcs low plus 1.5 \u03bcs high for data words and the opposite for command and status words, which cannot occur in the Manchester code) and followed by an odd parity bit. Practically each word could be considered as a 20-bit word: 3 bit for sync, 16 bit for payload and 1 bit for odd parity control. The words within a message are transmitted contiguously and there has to be a minimum of a 4 \u03bcs gap between messages. However, this inter-message gap can be, and often is, much larger than 4 \u03bcs, even up to 1 ms with some older Bus Controllers.

Selectrix is based on the principle of using one single data bus for controlling everything in a model railway layout including rolling stock and accessories, and carrying feedback from various system components. The data bus is bi-directional and synchronized. This makes it possible to integrate many types of automatic functions in a model railway without a separate control computer and software using only a Selectrix central unit. Because the data packets are being sent out and received within a fixed timeframe, the system speed and reaction times are not dependent of the number of decoders to control, like is the case with other systems, most notably the National Model Railroad Association's Digital Command Control (NMRA-DCC). Selectrix is also very resistant against data communication errors between the central unit and decoders in locomotives or data bus.",

            "document": "Direct memory access . The \"cycle stealing mode\" is used in systems in which the CPU should not be disabled for the length of time needed for burst transfer modes. In the cycle stealing mode, the DMA controller obtains access to the system bus the same way as in burst mode, using \"BR (Bus Request)\" and \"BG (Bus Grant)\" signal s, which are the two signals controlling the interface between the CPU and the DMA controller. However, in cycle stealing mode, after one byte of data transfer, the control of the system bus is deasserted to the CPU via BG. It is then continually requested again via BR, transferring one byte of data per request, until the entire block of data has been transferred. By continually obtaining and releasing the control of the system bus, the DMA controller essentially interleaves instruction and data transfers. The CPU processes an instruction, then the DMA controller transfers one data value, and so on. On the one hand, the data block is not transferred as quickly in cycle stealing mode as in burst mode, but on the other hand the CPU is not idled for as long as in burst mode. Cycle stealing mode is useful for controllers that monitor data in real time.",

However, such vehicles were at a disadvantage by comparison in terms of meeting safety regulations. To provide an alternative to 15-passenger vans (called \"non-conforming vans\" because they do not meet any safety standards for school buses), bus manufacturers have designed vehicles as alternatives to 15-passenger vans. These are called Multi-Function School Activity Buses (MFSAB). The basic design of MFSABs differs from yellow school buses because of their intended use. As they are intended for point-to-point transportation instead of route service, MFSABs are not fitted with traffic control devices (i.e., red warning lights, stop arm) nor are they painted school bus yellow. MFSAB buses are typically based on Type A school buses, although manufacturers offer MFSAB configurations for full-size buses as well.",
