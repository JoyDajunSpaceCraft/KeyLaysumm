Two species of hookworms that commonly infect humans are \"Ancylostoma duodenale\" and \"Necator americanus\". Hookworm eggs occur in the stool of infected people. If these end up in the environment, they can hatch into immature worms, which can then penetrate the skin. One type can also be spread through contaminated food. Risk factors include walking barefoot in warm climates where sanitation is poor. Diagnosis is by examination of a stool sample with a microscope. The disease can be prevented on an individual level by not walking barefoot in areas where the disease is common. At a population level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using feces as fertilizer, and mass deworming is effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia. Hookworm infected about 428 million in 2015. Heavy infections can occur in both children and adults but are less common in adults. It is rarely fatal.

Ground-itch, which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry, is common in patients infected with \"N. americanus\". Additionally, cough and pneumonitis may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea. Then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature, the infected individual will suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the \u201csilent and insidious\u201d symptoms referred to by Stoll are related to chronic, heavy-intensity hookworm infections. Major morbidity associated with hookworm infection is caused by intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and protein malnutrition. They result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood, rupturing erythrocytes, and degrading hemoglobin in the host. This long-term blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema; eosinophilia and pica caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworm-infected patients. Recently, more attention has been given to other important outcomes of hookworm infection that play a large role in public health. It is now widely accepted that children who suffer from chronic hookworm infection can suffer from growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments.

Many hookworms can infect the host by skin penetration, an important discovery made by A. Looss when he accidentally spilt larvae in water on his hand in 1898. The larvae release enzymes to assist their passage through the skin. There are three species that infect humans. Fourth-stage and adult hookworms suck blood, which can cause anaemia in humans with malnutrition. The third-stage larvae are carried by general circulation to the heart and lungs. In the lungs, they enter alveoli and begin to develop to the fourth stage. Then they migrate to the trachea and intestine. They attach to the wall of the intestine, reaching the adult stage in two to seven weeks, depending on the species. If the infective third stage is ingested orally, the worm can still, nevertheless, attach to the gut wall and develop to the adult stage. In a resistant host, the third stage larva can invade tissue and persist, eventually infecting offspring in females either in milk or prenatally. This phenomenon, well-studied in trichostrongyles of herbivores and known as \"arrest\", occurs in several hookworm species such as \"Ancylostoma caninum\" in canids, \"Uncinaria lucasi\" in fur seals and \"Ancylostoma duodenale\" in humans.",

Two species of hookworms that commonly infect humans are \"Ancylostoma duodenale\" and \"Necator americanus\". Hookworm eggs occur in the stool of infected people. If these end up in the environment, they can hatch into immature worms, which can then penetrate the skin. One type can also be spread through contaminated food. Risk factors include walking barefoot in warm climates where sanitation is poor. Diagnosis is by examination of a stool sample with a microscope. The disease can be prevented on an individual level by not walking barefoot in areas where the disease is common. At a population level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using feces as fertilizer, and mass deworming is effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia. Hookworm infected about 428 million in 2015.

Ground-itch, which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry, is common in patients infected with \"N. americanus\". Additionally, cough and pneumonitis may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea. Then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature, the infected individual will suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the \u201csilent and insidious\u201d symptoms referred to by Stoll are related to chronic, heavy-intensity hookworm infections. Major morbidity associated with hookworm infection is caused by intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and protein malnutrition. They result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood, rupturing erythrocytes, and degrading hemoglobin in the host. This long-term blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema; eosinophilia and pica caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworm-infected patients. Recently, more attention has been given to other important outcomes of hookworm infection that play a large role in public health. It is now widely accepted that children who suffer from chronic hookworm infection can suffer from growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments.

Many hookworms can infect the host by skin penetration, an important discovery made by A. Looss when he accidentally spilt larvae in water on his hand in 1898. The larvae release enzymes to assist their passage through the skin. There are three species that infect humans. Fourth-stage and adult hookworms suck blood, which can cause anaemia in humans with malnutrition. The third-stage larvae are carried by general circulation to the heart and lungs. In the lungs, they enter alveoli and begin to develop to the fourth stage. Then they migrate to the trachea and intestine. They attach to the wall of the intestine, reaching the adult stage in two to seven weeks, depending on the species. If the infective third stage is ingested orally, the worm can still, nevertheless, attach to the gut wall and develop to the adult stage. In a resistant host, the third stage larva can invade tissue and persist, eventually infecting offspring in females either in milk or prenatally.

Some hypotheses and studies suggest that helminth infections may protect against cerebral malaria due to the possible modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines responses. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying this supposed increased susceptibility to disease are unknown. For example, helminth infections cause potent and highly polarized immune response characterized by increased T-helper cell type 2 (T2) cytokine and Immunoglobulin E(IgE) production.

Infection can occur by penetration of the skin, eating other hosts such as birds, or by directly consuming the organism. This hookworm can also infect humans, causing a dermatitis. \"Ancylostoma tubaeforme\" along with \"Ancylostoma braziliense\" are the two most common hookworms to infect cats, causing anemia and also compromising the immune system.",

It is estimated that a third of all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.",

Looss was sent by Rudolf Leuckart to Egypt to study the transmission of bilharzia, where he became accidentally infected with hookworm, and in so doing discovered the method by which the larvae penetrate the skin. He spilt some larval culture onto his hand in 1896, while dropping it into the mouths of guinea pigs; observing the irritation this caused to his skin, he hypothesised that infection pass through the skin. He examined his faeces at intervals and found hookworm eggs in it a few weeks later. The paper he wrote about the life cycle of the hookworm is considered a classic in the field. He later described the species as \"Ancylostoma duodenale\".",

In 1899, American zoologist Charles Wardell Stiles identified progressive pernicious anemia seen in the southern United States as being caused by the hookworm \"A. duodenale\". Testing in the 1900s revealed very heavy infestations in school-age children. In Puerto Rico, Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, a US Army physician, organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign, which cured approximately 300,000 people (one-third of the Puerto Rican population) and reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent during the years 1903\u20131904. On October 26, 1909 the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease was organized as a result of a gift of US$1 million from John D. Rockefeller, Sr. The five-year program was a remarkable success and a great contribution to the United States' public health, instilling public education, medication, field work and modern government health departments in eleven southern states. The hookworm exhibit was a prominent part of the 1910 Mississippi state fair.",
