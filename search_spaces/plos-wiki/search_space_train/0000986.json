In the post-genomic age, high-throughput sequencing and gene/protein profiling techniques have transformed biological research by enabling comprehensive monitoring of a biological system, yielding a list of differentially expressed genes or proteins, which is useful in identifying genes that may have roles in a given phenomenon or phenotype. With DNA microarrays and genome-wide gene engineering, it is possible to screen global gene expression profiles to contribute a wealth of genomic data to the public domain. With RNA interference, it is possible to distill the inferences contained in the experimental literature and primary databases into knowledge bases that consist of annotated representations of biological pathways. In this case, individual genes and proteins are known to be involved in biological processes, components, or structures, as well as how and where gene products interact with each other. Pathway-oriented approaches for analyzing microarray data, by grouping long lists of individual genes, proteins, and/or other biological molecules according to the pathways they are involved in into smaller sets of related genes or proteins, which reduces the complexity, have proven useful for connecting genomic data to specific biological processes and systems. Identifying active pathways that differ between two conditions can have more explanatory power than a simple list of different genes or proteins. In addition, a large number of pathway analytic methods exploit pathway knowledge in public repositories such as Gene Ontology (GO) or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), rather than inferring pathways from molecular measurements. Furthermore, different research focuses have given the word \"pathway\" different meanings. For example, 'pathway' can denote a metabolic pathway involving a sequence of enzyme-catalyzed reactions of small molecules, or a signaling pathway involving a set of protein phosphorylation reactions and gene regulation events. Therefore, the term \"pathway analysis\" has a very broad application. For instance, it can refer to the analysis physical interaction networks (e.g., protein\u2013protein interactions), kinetic simulation of pathways, and steady-state pathway analysis (e.g., flux-balance analysis), as well as its usage in the inference of pathways from expression and sequence data. Several functional enrichment analysis tools and algorithms have been developed to enhance data interpretation. The existing knowledge base\u2013driven pathway analysis methods in each generation have been summarized in recent literature.",

Characterizing the binding mechanisms and specificities of transcription factors to specific regions of DNA \u2013 and identifying these transcription factors \u2013 is a fundamental component of the process of resolving cellular regulatory dynamics. Before the introduction of SMiLE-seq technology, ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) and HT-SELEX (high throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technologies were used to successfully characterize nearly 500 transcription factor-DNA binding interactions. ChIP-seq uses immunoprecipitation to isolate specific transcription factors bound to DNA fragments. Immunoprecipitation is followed by DNA sequencing, which identifies the genomic regions to which transcription factors bind. HT-SELEX, a similar method, uses random, synthetically generated DNA molecules as bait for transcription factors \"in vitro\". Sequence preferences and binding affinities are characterized based on successful binding interactions between bait molecules and transcription factors. While many unique transcription factor-DNA binding interactions have been characterized using these methods, it is estimated that this described fraction represents fewer than 50% of the transcription factors present in humans. The development of SMiLE-seq technology has provided an attractive alternative method with the potential to facilitate identification and characterization of previously undescribed transcription factor-DNA binding interactions.",

Transcriptional initiation, termination and regulation are mediated by \u201cDNA looping\u201d which brings together promoters, enhancers, transcription factors and RNA processing factors to accurately regulate gene expression.

The configuration of the genome is essential for enhancer-promoter proximity. Cell-fate decisions are mediated upon highly dynamic genomic reorganizations at interphase to modularly switch on or off entire gene regulatory networks through short to long range chromatin rearrangements. Related studies demonstrate that metazoan genomes are partitioned in structural and functional units around a megabase long called Topological association domains (TADs) containing dozens of genes regulated by hundreds of enhancers distributed within large genomic regions containing only non-coding sequences. The function of TADs is to regroup enhancers and promoters interacting together within a single large functional domain instead of having them spread in different TADs. However, studies of mouse development point out that two adjacent TADs may regulate the same gene cluster. The most relevant study on limb evolution shows that the TAD at the 5\u2019 of the HoxD gene cluster in tetrapod genomes drives its expression in the distal limb bud embryos, giving rise to the hand, while the one located at 3\u2019 side does it in the proximal limb bud, giving rise to the arm. Still, it is not known whether TADs are an adaptive strategy to enhance regulatory interactions or an effect of the constrains on these same interactions. TAD boundaries are often composed by housekeeping genes, tRNAs, other highly expressed sequences and Short Interspersed Elements (SINE). While these genes may take advantage of their border position to be ubiquitously expressed, they are not directly linked with TAD edge formation. The specific molecules identified at boundaries of TADs are called insulators or architectural proteins because they not only block enhancer leaky expression but also ensure an accurate compartmentalization of cis-regulatory inputs to the targeted promoter. These insulators are DNA-binding proteins like CTCF and TFIIIC that help recruiting structural partners such as cohesins and condensins. The localization and binding of architectural proteins to their corresponding binding sites is regulated by post-translational modifications. DNA binding motifs recognized by architectural proteins are either of high occupancy and at around a megabase of each other or of low occupancy and inside TADs. High occupancy sites are usually conserved and static while intra-TADs sites are dynamic according to the state of the cell therefore TADs themselves are compartmentalized in subdomains that can be called subTADs from few kb up to a TAD long (19). When architectural binding sites are at less than 100 kb from each other, Mediator proteins are the architectural proteins cooperate with cohesin. For subTADs larger than 100 kb and TAD boundaries, CTCF is the typical insulator found to interact with cohesion.",

            "document": "Transcriptional regulation . Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences in order to regulate the expression of a given gene. The power of transcription factors resides in their ability to activate and/or repress wide repertoires of downstream target genes. The fact that these transcription factors work in a combinatorial fashion means that only a small subset of an organism's genome encodes transcription factors. Transcription factors function through a wide variety of mechanisms. Often they are at the end of a signal transduction pathway that functions to change something about the factor, like its subcellular localization or its activity. Post-translational modifications to transcription factors located in the cytosol can cause them to translocate to the nucleus where they can interact with their corresponding enhancers. Others are already in the nucleus, and are modified to enable the interaction with partner transcription factors. Some post-translational modifications known to regulate the functional state of transcription factors are phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitylation. Transcription factors can be divided in two main categories: activators and repressors. While activators can interact directly or indirectly with the core machinery of transcription through enhancer binding, repressors predominantly recruit co-repressor complexes leading to transcriptional repression by chromatin condensation of enhancer regions. It may also happen that a repressor may function by allosteric competition against a determined activator to repress gene expression: overlapping DNA-binding motifs for both activators and repressors induce a physical competition to occupy the site of binding. If the repressor has a higher affinity for its motif than the activator, transcription would be effectively blocked in the presence of the repressor. Tight regulatory control is achieved by the highly dynamic nature of transcription factors. Again, many different mechanisms exist to control whether a transcription factor is active. These mechanisms include control over protein localization or control over whether the protein can bind DNA. An example of this is the protein HSF1, which remains bound to Hsp70 in the cytosol and is only translocated into the nucleus upon cellular stress such as heat shock. Thus the genes under the control of this transcription factor will remain untranscribed unless the cell is subjected to stress.",

            "document": "Transposon mutagenesis . The Sleeping Beauty transposon system (SBTS) is the first successful non-viral vector for incorporation of a gene cassette into a vertebrate genome. Up until the development of this system, the major problems with non-viral gene therapy have been the intracellular breakdown of the transgene due to it being recognized as prokaryotic and the inefficient delivery of the transgene into organ systems. The SBTS revolutionized these issues by combining the advantages of viruses and naked DNA. It consists of a transposon containing the cassette of genes to be expressed, as well as its own transposase enzyme. By transposing the cassette directly into the genome of the organism from the plasmid, sustained expression of the transgene can be attained. This can be further refined by enhancing the transposon sequences and the transposase enzymes used. SB100X is a hyperactive mammalian transposase which is roughly 100x more efficient than the typical first-generation transposase. Incorporation of this enzyme into the cassette results in even more sustained transgene expression (over one year). Additionally, transgenesis frequencies can be as high as 45% when using pronuclear injection into mouse zygotes. The mechanism of the SBTS is similar to the Tn5 transposon system, however the enzyme and gene sequences are eukaryotic in nature as opposed to prokaryotic. The system's tranposase can act in \"trans\" as well as in \"cis\", allowing a diverse collection of transposon structures. The transposon itself is flanked by inverted repeat sequences, which are each repeated twice in a direct fashion, designated IR/DR sequences. The internal region consists of the gene or sequence to be transposed, and could also contain the transposase gene. Alternatively, the transposase can be encoded on a separate plasmid or injected in its protein form. Yet another approach is to incorporate both the transposon and the transposase genes into a viral vector, which can target a cell or tissue of choice. The transposase protein is extremely specific in the sequences that it binds, and is able to discern its IR/DR sequences from a similar sequence by three base pairs. Once the enzyme is bound to both ends of the transposon, the IR/DR sequences are brought together and held by the transposase in a Synaptic Complex Formation (SCF). The formation of the SCF is a checkpoint ensuring proper cleavage. HMGB1 is a non-histone protein from the host which is associated with eukaryotic chromatin. It enhances the preferential binding of the transposase to the IR/DR sequences and is likely essential for SCF complex formation/stability. Transposase cleaves the DNA at the target sites, generating 3' overhangs. The enzyme then targets TA dinucleotides in the host genome as target sites for integration. The same enzymatic catalytic site which cleaved the DNA is responsible for integrating the DNA into the genome, duplicating the region of the genome in the process. Although transposase is specific for TA dinucleotides, the high frequency of these pairs in the genome indicates that the transposon undergoes fairly random integration.",

In 2008 it was noted that transcription twists DNA, leaving a trail of undercoiled (or negatively supercoiled) DNA in its wake. Moreover, they discovered that the DNA sequence itself effects how the molecule responds to supercoiling. For example, the researchers identified a specific sequence of DNA that regulates transcription speed; as the amount of supercoil rises and falls, it slows or speeds the pace at which molecular machinery reads DNA. It is hypothesized that these structural changes might trigger stress elsewhere along its length, which in turn might provide trigger points for replication or gene expression.

The 3'-UTR often contains regulatory regions that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. Regulatory regions within the 3'-untranslated region can influence polyadenylation, translation efficiency, localization, and stability of the mRNA. The 3'-UTR contains both binding sites for regulatory proteins as well as microRNAs (miRNAs). By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also has silencer regions which bind to repressor proteins and will inhibit the expression of the mRNA. Many 3'-UTRs also contain AU-rich elements (AREs). Proteins bind AREs to affect the stability or decay rate of transcripts in a localized manner or affect translation initiation. Furthermore, the 3'-UTR contains the sequence AAUAAA that directs addition of several hundred adenine residues called the poly(A) tail to the end of the mRNA transcript. Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds to this tail, contributing to regulation of mRNA translation, stability, and export. For example, poly (A) tail bound PABP interacts with proteins associated with the 5' end of the transcript, causing a circularization of the mRNA that promotes translation. The 3'-UTR can also contain sequences that attract proteins to associate the mRNA with the cytoskeleton, transport it to or from the cell nucleus, or perform other types of localization. In addition to sequences within the 3'-UTR, the physical characteristics of the region, including its length and secondary structure, contribute to translation regulation.

The cell memory of a given positional value depends on two inputs, the first being the ability of many Hox proteins to autoactivate their own transcription, and the second derived from two large groups of transcriptional regulators: The Polycomb group and the Trithorax group. A defect in either of these regulators results in a pattern which is initially correct but is not maintained at later embryonic stages. The Polycomb and Trithorax regulators act in opposite ways. The Trithorax group maintains Hox transcription after transcription is already activated. The Polycomb group forms stable complexes that bind to the chromatin of Hox genes, and keep it in a repressed state at sites where Hox genes are not active.",

Rrm3p is known to affect an estimated 1400 discrete replication fork sites in the \"S. cerevisiae\" genome, including sites at ribosomal DNA repeats, tRNA genes, centromeres, telomeres, G4 DNA and the silent mating-type loci. At these sites, replication forks will stall in the absence of Rrm3p. Inactivation of RRM3 causes chromosomal breakage at these Rrm3p associated sites throughout the genome. Rrm3p is also commonly associated with telomeric and subtelomeric DNA replication, in which its effects are thought to be direct. Although Rrm3p has specific associated sites within the genome, the absence of Rrm3p causes a genome-wide delay in replication including regions that are not Rrm3p-dependant. Furthermore, Rrm3p has been found to move globally in conjunction with proteins associated with the replisome. There is some debate within the literature as to whether Rrm3p is part of the replisome or if it is a protein that is recruited to genomic sites upon pausing of replication forks. Rrm3p is known to affect de novo telomere addition by influencing Pif1p activity on telomeres. Rrm3p is also seen to play a role in replication forks around rDNA, including replication and regulatory regions for transcription of 35S and 5S rRNA's. Rrm3p reduces the accumulation of rDNA circles in yeast, and mutations to Rrmp3 results in increased recombination of ribosomal DNA. This increase in recombination has been attributed to interactions between the protein Rrm3p and actual nucleotide base sequence from rDNA regions, rather than interactions due to the secondary structure formed by tandemly repeated DNA regions. This suggests Rrm3p plays a role in the maintenance of rDNA stability, although the exact mechanistic details are still unclear.",

Functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to make use of the vast wealth of data given by genomic and transcriptomic projects (such as genome sequencing projects and RNA sequencing) to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. Unlike structural genomics, functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription, translation, regulation of gene expression and protein\u2013protein interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional \u201cgene-by-gene\u201d approach.

In later stages, the parasite crosses the blood brain barrier, resulting in a devastating and usually fatal outcome. As a result of replicating in the bloodstream, \"T. brucei\" parasites are subjected to numerous host defense mechanisms including soluble components of the immune system ( i.e. complement), as well as cellular components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In order to protect itself from host defenses, the parasite decorates itself with a dense, homogeneous coat (~10^7 molecules) of glycoprotein known as the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG).  In the early stages of invasion, the dense protein coat is sufficient to protect the parasite from immune detection. However, the host eventually identifies the VSG as a foreign antigen and mounts an attack against the microbe. The \"T. brucei\" parasite has evolved an elegant mechanism to display a completely new coat of VSG antigen, rendering it once again invisible to the host\u2019s immune system. The parasite\u2019s genome has over 1,000 genes that code for different variants of the VSG protein. VSG genes can be found on the subtelomeric portion of large chromosomes, or on intermediate chromosomes. VSG genes also exist in arrays and many exist as pseudogenes.  There is a hierarchy by which the VSG genes are activated. Telomeric VSGs are activated first, followed by array VSGs, and finally pseudogene VSGs. Switching of VSG proteins occurs at a rate substantially higher than the background mutation rate of other genes in the parasite (suggesting that it is a regulated process). The process is partially dependent on homologous recombination of DNA, which is mediated in part by the interaction of the \"T. brucei\" BRCA2 gene with RAD51 (however, this is not the only responsible mechanism, as BRCA2 variants still display some VSG switching). In addition to homologous recombination, transcriptional regulation also plays an important role in antigen switching. This is in contrast to other pathogens, where antigenic variation is typically mediated by DNA rearrangements or transcriptional regulation. The process by which VSG switching occurs has not been fully elucidated, but it is known that activation of VSGs requires recombination of the VSG genes into a VSG expression site (ES). The ES consists of a single \"vsg\" gene flanked by an upstream array of 70 base pair repeats and expression site associated genes (ESAGs). \"T. brucei\" expresses one VSG at any given time, and the active VSG can either be selected by activation of a previously silent ES, or by recombination of a VSG sequence into the active ES (see the figure \"Mechanisms of VSG Switching in \"T. brucei\"\"). Although the biological triggers that result in VSG switching are not fully known, mathematical modeling suggests that the ordered appearance of different VSG variants is controlled by at least two key parasite-derived factors: differential activation rates of parasite VSG and density-dependent parasite differentiation.",

Epigenetic modifications are heritable alterations that are not due to changes in the sequence of nucleotides. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, alter the accessibility to DNA and change chromatin structure, thereby regulating patterns of gene expression. Methylated histones can act as binding sites for certain transcription factors due to their bromodomains and chromodomains. Methylated histones can also prevent the binding of transcription factors by hiding the transcription factor's recognition site, which is usually found on the major groove of DNA. The methyl groups bound to the cytosine residues lie in the major groove of DNA, the same region most transcription factors use to read a DNA sequence. A common epigenetic tag found in DNA is the covalent attachment of a methyl group to the C5 position of the cytosine found in CpG dinucleotide sequences. CpG methylation is an important mechanism of transcriptional silencing. Methylation of CpG islands is shown to reduce gene expression by the formation of tightly condensed heterochromatin that is transcriptionally inactive. CpG sites in a gene are most commonly found in the promoter regions of a gene while also being present in non promoter regions. The CpG sites in non promoter regions tend to be constitutively methylated, causing transcription machinery to ignore them as possible promoters. The CpG site near promoter regions are mostly left unmethylated until a cell decides to methylate them and repress transcription. Methylation of CpGs in promoter regions result in the transcriptional silencing of a gene.

It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a methylase domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in methylation state of DNA in that region will subsequently result. Transcription rates of genes so-affected will be reduced. Many of the effector domains function to modulate either the DNA directly - e.g. via methylation, cleaving, or recombination of the target DNA sequence - or by modulating its transcription rate - e.g. inhibiting transcription via repressor domains that block transcriptional machinery, promoting transcription with activation domains that recruit transcriptional machinery to the site, or histone- or other epigenetic-modification domains that affect chromatin state and the ability of transcriptional machinery to access the affected genes. Epigenetic modification is a major theme in determining varying expression levels for genes, as explained by the idea that how tightly-wound the DNA strand is - from histones at the local level up to chromatin at the chromosomal level - can influence the accessibility of sequences of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing the rate at which it can be transcribed. If, instead of impacting the DNA strand directly, as described above, a designer zinc-finger protein instead affects epigenetic modification state for a target DNA region, modulation of gene expression could similarly be accomplished. In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression in vivo, Choo \"et al\" designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. This specific oncogene is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The oncogene typically enables leukemia cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of cancer. By including a nuclear localization signal with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo \"et al\" were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo.

Interestingly, the coding or non-transcribed strand accumulates more mutations than the template strand. This is due to the fact that the coding strand is single-stranded during transcription, which is chemically more unstable than double-stranded DNA. During elongation of transcription, supercoiling can occur behind an elongating RNA polymerase, leading to single-stranded breaks. When the coding strand is single-stranded, it can also hybridize with itself, creating DNA secondary structures that can compromise replication. In E. coli, when attempting to transcribe GAA triplets such as those found in Friedrich\u2019s ataxia, the resulting RNA and template strand can form mismatched loops between different repeats, leading the complementary segment in the coding-strand available to form its own loops which impede replication. Furthermore, replication of DNA and transcription of DNA are not temporally independent; they can occur at the same time and lead to collisions between the replication fork and RNA polymerase complex. In S. cerevisiae, Rrm3 helicase is found at highly transcribed genes in the yeast genome, which is recruited to stabilize a stalling replication fork as described above.

The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.",

A more likely source of cellular plasticity is through the Regulation of gene expression, such that while two cells may have near identical DNA, the differential expression of certain genes results in variation. Research has shown that cells are capable of regulating gene expression at several stages: mRNA transcription, processing and transportation as well as in protein translation, post-translational processing and degradation. Regulatory proteins that bind to DNA, RNA, and/or proteins are key effectors in these processes and function by positively or negatively regulating specific protein level and function in a cell. And, while DNA binding transcription factors provide a mechanism for specific control of cellular responses, a model where DNA binding transcription factors are the sole regulators of gene activity is also unlikely.

Several bioinformatic tools that have been developed for functional enrichment analysis can be applied to differentially methylated regions by first mapping these regions to genes. This is done by mapping the distance between the CpGs and a gene promoter that is potentially regulated by this region. Enrichment analysis based on the genomic region has thus been suggested as a complementary approach and confers substantial interpretive potential.

The power of transcription factors resides in their ability to activate and/or repress wide repertoires of downstream target genes. The fact that these transcription factors work in a combinatorial fashion means that only a small subset of an organism's genome encodes transcription factors. Transcription factors function through a wide variety of mechanisms. Often they are at the end of a signal transduction pathway that functions to change something about the factor, like its subcellular localization or its activity. Post-translational modifications to transcription factors located in the cytosol can cause them to translocate to the nucleus where they can interact with their corresponding enhancers. Others are already in the nucleus, and are modified to enable the interaction with partner transcription factors. Some post-translational modifications known to regulate the functional state of transcription factors are phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitylation. Transcription factors can be divided in two main categories: activators and repressors. While activators can interact directly or indirectly with the core machinery of transcription through enhancer binding, repressors predominantly recruit co-repressor complexes leading to transcriptional repression by chromatin condensation of enhancer regions. It may also happen that a repressor may function by allosteric competition against a determined activator to repress gene expression: overlapping DNA-binding motifs for both activators and repressors induce a physical competition to occupy the site of binding. If the repressor has a higher affinity for its motif than the activator, transcription would be effectively blocked in the presence of the repressor. Tight regulatory control is achieved by the highly dynamic nature of transcription factors. Again, many different mechanisms exist to control whether a transcription factor is active. These mechanisms include control over protein localization or control over whether the protein can bind DNA. An example of this is the protein HSF1, which remains bound to Hsp70 in the cytosol and is only translocated into the nucleus upon cellular stress such as heat shock. Thus the genes under the control of this transcription factor will remain untranscribed unless the cell is subjected to stress.",

The AR goes through a series of conformational changes and HSP dissociate from AR. The transformed AR undergoes dimerisation, phosphorylation and translocates to the nucleus.

Transcription of single-stranded RNA from a double-stranded DNA template requires the selection of one strand of the DNA template as the template strand that directly interacts with the nascent RNA due to complementary sequence. The other strand is not copied directly, but necessarily its sequence will be similar to that of the RNA. Transcription initiation sites generally occur on both strands of an organism's DNA, and specify the location, direction, and circumstances under which transcription will occur. If the transcript encodes one or (rarely) more proteins, translation of each protein by the ribosome will proceed in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, and will extend the protein from its N terminus toward its C terminus. For example, in a typical gene a start codon (5\u2032-ATG-3\u2032) is a DNA sequence within the sense strand. Transcription begins at an upstream site (relative to the sense strand), and as it proceeds through the region it copies the 3\u2032-TAC-5\u2032 from the template strand to produce 5\u2032-AUG-3\u2032 within a messenger RNA. The mRNA is scanned by the ribosome from the 5\u2032 end, where the start codon directs the incorporation of a methionine (in eukaryotes) at the N terminus of the protein.

Geminiviruses replicate via a rolling circle mechanism like bacteriophages such as M13, and many plasmids. Replication occurs within the nucleus of an infected plant cell. First the single-stranded circular DNA is converted to a double-stranded circular intermediate. This step involves the use of cellular DNA repair enzymes to produce a complementary negative-sense strand, using the viral genomic or plus-sense DNA strand as a template. The next step is the rolling circle phase, where the viral strand is cleaved at a specific site situated within the origin of replication by the viral Rep protein in order to initiate replication. This process in a eukaryotic nucleus can give rise to concatemeric double-stranded forms of replicative intermediate genomes, although double-stranded unit circles can be isolated from infected plants and cells. New single-stranded DNA forms of the virus genome (plus-sense) are probably formed by interaction of the coat protein with replicating DNA intermediates, as genomes lacking a CP gene do not form ssDNA. The ssDNA is packaged into germinate particles in the nucleus. It is not clear if these particles can then leave the nucleus and be transmitted to surrounding cells as virions, or whether ssDNA associated with coat protein and a movement protein is the form of the genome that gets trafficked from cell to cell via the plasmodesmata.",
