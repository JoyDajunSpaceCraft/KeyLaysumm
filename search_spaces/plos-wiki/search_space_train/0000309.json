A metabolic reconstruction provides a highly mathematical, structured platform on which to understand the systems biology of metabolic pathways within an organism. The integration of biochemical metabolic pathways with rapidly available, unannotated genome sequences has developed what are called genome-scale metabolic models. Simply put, these models correspond metabolic genes with metabolic pathways. In general, the more information about physiology, biochemistry and genetics is available for the target organism, the better the predictive capacity of the reconstructed models. Mechanically speaking, the process of reconstructing prokaryotic and eukaryotic metabolic networks is essentially the same. Having said this, eukaryote reconstructions are typically more challenging because of the size of genomes, coverage of knowledge, and the multitude of cellular compartments. The first genome-scale metabolic model was generated in 1995 for \"Haemophilus influenzae\". The first multicellular organism, \"C. elegans\", was reconstructed in 1998. Since then, many reconstructions have been formed. For a list of reconstructions that have been converted into a model and experimentally validated, see http://sbrg.ucsd.edu/InSilicoOrganisms/OtherOrganisms.",

When an uncharacterized protein is found in the genome, its amino acid sequence is first compared to those of previously characterized proteins to search for homology. When a homologous protein is found, the proteins are considered to have a common ancestor and their functions are inferred as being similar. However, the quality of a reconstruction model is dependent on its ability to accurately infer phenotype directly from sequence, so this rough estimation of protein function will not be sufficient.

In contrast to the traditional biotechnological practice of obtaining peptides or proteins by isolation from cellular hosts through cellular protein production, advances in chemical techniques for the synthesis and ligation of peptides has allowed for the total synthesis of some peptides and proteins. Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue specific incorporation of \"posttranslational modifications\" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even ubiquitination. These capabilities are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins. Although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends, the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein. Given the widely recognized importance of proteins as cellular catalysts and recognition elements, the ability to precisely control the composition and connectivity of polypeptides is a valued tool in the chemical biology community and is an area of active research. While chemists have been making peptides for over 100 years, the ability to efficiently and quickly synthesize short peptides came of age with the development of Bruce Merrifield's solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Prior to the development of SPPS, the concept of step-by-step polymer synthesis on an insoluble support was without chemical precedent. The use of a covalently bound insoluble polymeric support greatly simplified the process of peptide synthesis by reducing purification to a simple \"filtration and wash\" procedure and facilitated a boom in the field of peptide chemistry. The development and \"optimization\" of SPPS took peptide synthesis from the hands of the specialized peptide synthesis community and put it into the hands of the broader chemistry, biochemistry, and now chemical biology community. SPPS is still the method of choice for linear synthesis of polypeptides up to 50 residues in length and has been implemented in commercially available automated peptide synthesizers. One inherent shortcoming in any procedure that calls for repeated coupling reactions is the buildup of side products resulting from incomplete couplings and side reactions. This places the upper bound for the synthesis of linear polypeptide lengths at around 50 amino acids, while the \"average\" protein consists of 250 amino acids. Clearly, there was a need for development of \"non-linear\" methods to allow synthetic access to the average protein.",

This term is a ratio of the efficiency of redox coupling between the biomass battery W, and the sources of chemical energy available to it, measured against loss to heat. ME is therefore a ratio of amperes of anabolism to amperes of catabolism. When the term is added by hand to the exponent of the power law (which becomes (4ME-1)/4ME, where ME is metabolic efficiency), values for the exponent of or , imply ME is 100 or 89% under this model. Efficiencies like these are not found in nature unless thermogenesis is included as part of metabolic rate. This removes the WBE version of Kleiber's law, which the metabolic theory of ecology rests on, from any biological relevance whatsoever. The efficiency that is purported to be modeled is actually assumed. In plants, according to a paper in 2006 in \"Nature\", the exponent of mass is close to 1. Under O'Kelly's model this is not possible since the implication is that ME is greater than 100% in the case of plants. The key problem is the nature of metabolic energy and the extent of what is considered metabolism. The problem is most clearly noticeable in the unit term for metabolic rate, i.e., calories/s. Calories are a measure of heat energy. This leads to the idea that thermogenesis is part of metabolism, Kleiber's original treatment, and rules out that metabolism is all about chemical energy, not heat energy. The picture is further obfuscated when the idea of respiratory metabolism is introduced to refine and limit the definition of metabolism such that oxygen consumption and synthesis of ATP are its ultimate factors. The data from study of oxygen consumption metabolic rates in cells in vitro suggests that the exponent is not only far less than , but also becomes negative for things less than one gram in size. Furthermore, glycogenesis is excluded from metabolic consideration on this model since glycogenesis is not included in the respiratory chain, and is itself a reduction reaction not strictly dependent upon the proximity of certain molecules and atoms delivered by capillaries and vibrating from Brownian motion. Energy is required for glycogenesis, and the blood does not deliver energy, just the ingredients for endergonic reactions. The energy comes from redox coupling, what ME is all about. Metabolic rate becomes the rate at which a biomass recharges so that its degeneration is prevented, and its organization is perpetuated. ME is here understood as a ratio of the rate of reduction reactions necessary for the maintenance, growth, replication and behavior of the biomass, to the rate of availability of energy captured and expended by that biomass. ME is a statement of redox coupling efficiency. ME excludes thermogenesis as part of metabolism, consequently. What influences BMR is the ME of the organism, not its mass. The organism determines ME, and that ME is the same for it and for its cells.",

ErbB3 was found to be the most sensitive node, leading to Akt activation; Akt regulates many biological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis and growth, which are all relevant to tumor progression. This target driven modelling has paved way for first of its kind clinical trials. Bekkal et al. presented a nonlinear model of the dynamics of a cell population divided into proliferative and quiescent compartments. The proliferative phase represents the complete cell cycle (G (1)-S-G (2)-M) of a population committed to divide at its end. The asymptotic behavior of solutions of the nonlinear model is analysed in two cases, exhibiting tissue homeostasis or tumor exponential growth.

This ability of \"Clostridium\" to metabolize sugars directly, or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs, suggests that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like \"Acetobacter\". However, \"Clostridium\" bacteria are less acid-tolerant than \"Acetobacter\". Even the most acid-tolerant \"Clostridium\" strains can produce vinegar in concentrations of only a few per cent, compared to \"Acetobacter\" strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to produce vinegar using \"Acetobacter\", rather than using \"Clostridium\" and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications.",

Often, metabolic pathway databases such as KEGG and MetaCyc will have \"holes\", meaning that there is a conversion from a substrate to a product (i.e., an enzymatic activity) for which there is no known protein in the genome that encodes the enzyme that facilitates the catalysis. What can also happen in semi-automatically drafted reconstructions is that some pathways are falsely predicted and don't actually occur in the predicted manner. Because of this, a systematic verification is made in order to make sure no inconsistencies are present and that all the entries listed are correct and accurate. Furthermore, previous literature can be researched in order to support any information obtained from one of the many metabolic reaction and genome databases. This provides an added level of assurance for the reconstruction that the enzyme and the reaction it catalyzes do actually occur in the organism.",

            "document": "Acetogen . Acetogens have diverse metabolic roles, which help them thrive in different environments. One of their metabolic products is acetate which is an important nutrient for the host and its inhabiting microbial community, most seen in termite's guts. Acetogens also serve as \"Hydrogen sinks\" in termite's GI tract. Hydrogen gas inhibits biodegradation and acetogens use up these hydrogen gases in the anaerobic environment to favor the biodegradative capacity of the host by reacting hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide to make acetate. Acetogens have the ability to use variety of substrates in an event where another competitor such as a methanogen makes Hydrogen gas a limiting substrate. Acetogens can use and convert alcohols, lactates and fatty acids, which are usually restricted to syntrophs, instead of just carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This enables them to take on the roles of important contributors of food chain such as primary fermenters. Acetogens can work together with methanogens, as exemplified by the conversion of carbohydrates by a Methanosarcina barkeri and coculture of A. woodii. The methanogen takes up acetate to favor the acetogen. Sometimes the interspecies transfer of Hydrogen gas between A. woodii and an H2-consuming methanogen results in hydrogen gas being released from the acetogen instead of going toward acetogenesis by WLP. Acetogens are also one of the contributors to corrosion of steel. Acetobacterium woodii utilize hydrogen gas and CO2 to make the acetate that is used as carbon source for many of the Sulfate-reducing bacteria growing with hydrogen gas and sulfate.",

The predictive aspect of a metabolic reconstruction hinges on the ability to predict the biochemical reaction catalyzed by a protein using that protein's amino acid sequence as an input, and to infer the structure of a metabolic network based on the predicted set of reactions. A network of enzymes and metabolites is drafted to relate sequences and function. When an uncharacterized protein is found in the genome, its amino acid sequence is first compared to those of previously characterized proteins to search for homology. When a homologous protein is found, the proteins are considered to have a common ancestor and their functions are inferred as being similar. However, the quality of a reconstruction model is dependent on its ability to accurately infer phenotype directly from sequence, so this rough estimation of protein function will not be sufficient. A number of algorithms and bioinformatics resources have been developed for refinement of sequence homology-based assignments of protein functions:",
