            "document": "Diabetes management software . Globally, an estimated 422 million adults are living with diabetes mellitus, according to the latest 2016 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Diabetes prevalence is increasing rapidly; previous 2013 estimates from the International Diabetes Federation put the number at 381 million people having diabetes. The number is projected to almost double by 2030. Type 2 diabetes makes up about 85-90% of all cases. Increases in the overall diabetes prevalence rates largely reflect an increase in risk factors for type 2, notably greater longevity and being overweight. Diabetes mellitus occurs throughout the world, but is more common is type 2 diabetes in the more developed countries. The greatest increase in prevalence is, however, occurring in low- and middle-income countries including in Asia and Africa, where most patients will probably be found by 2030. The increase in incidence in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, including increasingly sedentary lifestyles, less physically demanding work and the global nutrition transition, marked by increased intake of foods that are high energy-dense but nutrient-poor (often high in sugar and saturated fats, sometimes referred to as the Western pattern diet). The risk of getting type 2 diabetes has been widely found to be associated with lower socio-economic position across countries.[3,6] The WHO estimates that diabetes resulted in 1.5 million deaths in 2012, making it the 8th leading cause of death. However another 2.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of associated complications (e.g. heart disease, stroke, kidney failure), which often result in premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes.[5] The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. The global prevalence of diabetes among adults over 18 years of age has risen from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014. Diabetes prevalence has been rising more rapidly in middle- and low-income countries. Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. In 2012, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes and another 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose. Half of all deaths attributable to high blood glucose occur before the age of 70 years. WHO projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death in 2030 . Healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complications.[6] Epidemiologic patterns of T1D by demographic, geographic, biologic, cultural and other factors in populations are presented to gain insight about the etiology, natural history, risks, and complications of T1D. Data from large epidemiologic studies worldwide indicate that the incidence of T1D has been increasing by 2\u20135% worldwide and that the prevalence of T1D is approximately 1 in 300 in the US by 18 years of age. Research on risk factors for T1D is an active area of research to identify genetic and environmental triggers that could potentially be targeted for intervention. While significant advances have been made in the clinical care of T1D with resultant improvements in quality of life and clinical outcomes, much more needs to be done to improve care of, and ultimately find a cure for T1D. Epidemiologic studies have an important on-going role to investigate the complex causes, clinical care, prevention, and cure of T1D.",

HUNT 2 was divided into Adult and YOUNG-HUNT. YOUNG-HUNT involved the 13- to 19-year-old age group and Adult-HUNT involved participants over 20 years old. Blood samples were taken for participants of the Adult HUNT. Overall participation in HUNT 2 was roughly 75,000 people (70% of the overall population). Sixty one percent of the HUNT 2 participants also participated in the HUNT 1 survey. There were several additional studies in Adult-HUNT, including spirometry and benmassem\u00e5linger. HUNT 2 was a follow-up of the HUNT 1: the questions and comments regarding high blood pressure, diabetes and quality of life were identical or very similar to the questions in HUNT 1. HUNT 2 was a much larger study, with a larger age range (from 13 years upwards), a wider range of subjects, and that more data were collected for each participant. Approximately 70 000 persons participated in HUNT 2 (about 70% ), of which 45 000 had also participated in the HUNT 1 Clinical monitoring, data processing and quality control was performed after data collection was completed, and from autumn 1998 data files have been available to the research community. Besides the questionnaire data and clinical measurements were in HUNT 2 taken a venous blood sample from all participants of which was 20 years or older (a total of about 65 000), and after preliminary analysis, both serum samples and whole blood samples frozen. These store today at minus 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Also blood clot is stored in the frozen state.

In addition genetic material, blood, urine (adults) and cell samples from the mouth (youth) were stored in the HUNT biobank. HUNT 3 used the slogan \"A time for better health\". All residents in northern Norway 13 years and older were invited to participate. Approximately 105,000 people were invited, and data was collected on roughly 60,000. The overall attendance rate was about 56%, with variations depending on age. It used a survey of 18 different questionnaires based on the survey in HUNT 3. In Young HUNT 3 there was one form similar to the one used in Young HUNT 1. Adult participants filled out a common form called questionnaire 1 (Q1) and they were given questionnaire 2 (Q2) depending on age and gender. In addition, adults could be given one or more of questionnaire 3 (Q3). In addition to this, all adults who met in January 2009 were sent a small questionnaire with some key health and lifestyle variables. For adults measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, hip width, blood pressure and pulse were collected as well as bone mass and spirometry measurements. Adults were interviewed about occupation (occupational classification) and health related occupational exposure, and women were interviewed about issues related to pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding. People in the Young-HUNT steady had height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and spirometry measured. Biological material collected in HUNT 3 included blood for adults (5 glasses of varying quality), urine test (fresh or frozen) and cheek swabs for the youth. Collection of biological material was the largest investment in new HUNT 3, resulting in biobank of high international standard. As many as 75% of the HUNT 3 participants were also screened in the HUNT 2 survey.",

Prevalence is the number of cases alive, expressible as existing cases per million people during a period of time. Egg allergies are usually observed in infants and young children, and often disappear with age (see Prognosis), so prevalence of egg allergy may be expressed as a percentage of children under a set age. One review estimates that in North American and western European populations the prevalence of egg allergy in children under the age of five years is 1.8-2.0%. A second described the range in young children as 0.5-2.5%. Although the majority of children develop tolerance as they age into school age years, for roughly one-third the allergy persists into adulthood. Strong predictors for adult-persistent allergy are anaphylactic symptoms as a child, high egg-specific serum IgE, robust response to the skin prick test and absence of tolerance to egg-containing baked foods. Self-reported allergy prevalence is always higher than food-challenge confirmed allergy.",

Early seizures occur up to twice as frequently in brain injured children as they do in their adult counterparts. In one study, children under five with trivial brain injuries (those with no LOC, no PTA, no depressed skull fracture, and no hemorrhage) suffered an early seizure 17% of the time, while people over age\u00a05 did so only 2% of the time. Children under age five also have seizures within one hour of injury more often than adults do. One study found the incidence of early seizures to be highest among infants younger than one\u00a0year and particularly high among those who suffered perinatal injury.

The dependency ratio acts like a rollercoaster when going through the stages of the Demographic Transition Model. During stages 1 and 2, the dependency ratio is high due to significantly high crude birth rates putting pressure onto the smaller working-age population to take care of all of them. In stage 3, the dependency ratio starts to decrease because fertility and mortality rates start to decrease which shows that the proportion of adults to the young and elderly are much larger in this stage. In stages 4 and 5, the dependency ratio starts to increase once again as the working-age population retires. Because fertility rates caused the younger population to decrease, once they grow up and start working, there will be more pressure for them to take care of the previous working-age population that just retired since there will be more young and elderly people than working-age adults during that time period. The population structure of a country is an important factor for determining the economic status of their country. Japan is a great example of an aging population. They have a 1:4 ratio of people 65 years and older. This causes trouble for them because there is not enough people in the working-age population to support all of the elders.

Child participants have been able to provide interviewers with solid responses, which have proven to be both correct and detailed when given a cognitive interview. Researchers have recently reported that cognitive interviewing leads children to report detailed information that is particularly relevant to police investigations. The children demonstrate correct recall of the criminal, the crime, as well as objects and location in comparison to a controlled police interview. In one study, a modified version of the cognitive interview was deduced to ensure children fully understood the instructions of the interview as well as the questions they were being asked. They were taught to put themselves in another person\u2019s perspective. For example, \u201cPut yourself in the body of _________ and tell me what that person saw,\u201d. The children were made aware that they could use \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as a response. The MCI versions were found to be effective in children. Two additional studies were conducted to examine the effectiveness of the instructions used in both the cognitive interviews and of a new mnemonic, the \u2018cued recall\u2019 (CR), on children\u2019s recall and suggestibility levels.

In the second experiment 57 children were tested with a cognitive interview without the change order instruction (CO). The omission of the CO reduced children\u2019s suggestibility level. Results confirmed the effectiveness of this protocol. Moreover, children who were tested using the CI and its four modifications, reported more correct information than children interviewed with the SI at any age. Furthermore, a study done by Geiselman and his fellow researchers found that the CI reduced the negative effects of misinformation when the witnesses were previously interviewed with a CI.

The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash. Occasionally, tiny burrows may be seen in the skin. In a first-ever infection a person will usually develop symptoms in between two and six weeks. During a second infection symptoms may begin in as little as 24 hours. These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline. The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children. The itch is often worse at night. Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection of the skin. Scabies is caused by infection with the female mite \"Sarcoptes scabiei \"var.\" hominis\", an ectoparasite. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites. Often, only between 10 and 15 mites are involved in an infection. Scabies is most often spread during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes) such as that which may occur during sex or living together. Spread of disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet. Crowded living conditions, such as those found in child-care facilities, group homes, and prisons, increase the risk of spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher rates of disease. Crusted scabies is a more severe form of the disease. It typically only occurs in those with a poor immune system and people may have millions of mites, making them much more contagious. In these cases, spread of infection may occur during brief contact or by contaminated objects. The mite is very small and usually not directly visible. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms. A number of medications are available to treat those infected, including permethrin, crotamiton, and lindane creams and ivermectin pills. Sexual contacts within the last month and people who live in the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed. Scabies is one of the three most common skin disorders in children, along with ringworm and bacterial skin infections. As of 2015, it affects about 204\u00a0million people (2.8% of the world population). It is equally common in both sexes. The young and the old are more commonly affected. It also occurs more commonly in the developing world and tropical climates. The word scabies is from \"\", \"to scratch\". Other animals do not spread human scabies. Infection in other animals is typically caused by slightly different but related mites and is known as sarcoptic mange.",

The disease produces intense, itchy skin rashes when the impregnated female tunnels into the stratum corneum of the skin and deposits eggs in the burrow.
