Complementary to the field of structural genomics, \"protein structure prediction\" develops efficient mathematical models of proteins to computationally predict the molecular formations in theory, instead of detecting structures with laboratory observation. The most successful type of structure prediction, known as homology modeling, relies on the existence of a \"template\" structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled; structural genomics' goal is to provide sufficient representation in solved structures to model most of those that remain. Although producing accurate models remains a challenge when only distantly related template structures are available, it has been suggested that sequence alignment is the bottleneck in this process, as quite accurate models can be produced if a \"perfect\" sequence alignment is known. Many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of protein engineering, in which novel protein folds have already been designed. A more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions, such as in molecular docking and protein\u2013protein interaction prediction.",

If such a template protein is found, the structure of the protein of interest can be predicted based on a pairwise sequence alignment of the query with the template protein sequence.

HHblits was added to the HH-suite in 2011. It can build high-quality multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) starting from a single query sequence or MSA. From the query, a profile HMM can be calculated. By using MSAs instead of single sequences, the sensitivity of sequence searches and the quality of the resulting sequence alignments can be improved dramatically. MSAs are also the starting point for a multitude of downstream computational methods, such as methods to predict the secondary and tertiary structure of proteins, to predict their molecular functions or cellular pathways, to predict the positions in their sequence or structure that contribute to enzymatic activity or ligand-binding, to predict evolutionarily conserved residues, disease-causing versus neutral mutations, the proteins' cellular localization and many more.

The problem arises often in homology modeling, where the tertiary structure of an amino acid sequence is predicted based on a sequence alignment to a \"template\", or a second sequence whose structure is known. Because loops have highly variable sequences even within a given structural motif or protein fold, they often correspond to unaligned regions in sequence alignments; they also tend to be located at the solvent-exposed surface of globular proteins and thus are more conformationally flexible. Consequently, they often cannot be modeled using standard homology modeling techniques.

This can serve as a structural constraint on methods used to determine the native conformational fold of the protein.

Using the \"SAXS filter\", the authors were able to purify the set of de novo protein models significantly. This was further proved by structure homology searches. It was also shown, that the combination of SAXS scores with scores, used in threading methods, significantly improves the performance of fold recognition. On one example it was demonstrated how approximate tertiary structure of modular proteins can be assembled from high resolution NMR structures of domains, using SAXS data, confining the translational degrees of freedom.

Recent CASP experiments indicate that some protein threading methods such as RaptorX indeed are more sensitive than purely sequence(profile)-based methods when only distantly-related templates are available for the proteins under prediction. When performing a BLAST search, a reliable first approach is to identify hits with a sufficiently low \"E\"-value, which are considered sufficiently close in evolution to make a reliable homology model. Other factors may tip the balance in marginal cases; for example, the template may have a function similar to that of the query sequence, or it may belong to a homologous operon. However, a template with a poor \"E\"-value should generally not be chosen, even if it is the only one available, since it may well have a wrong structure, leading to the production of a misguided model.

Resolution is usually reported in Angstroms (10\u201310 meters) for X-ray crystal structures. The smaller the number, the better the degree of atomic resolution. In protein X-ray crystallography the best resolution typically attainable is about 1 Angstrom. This level of resolution allows individual hydrogen atoms to be visualized and heavy atoms (C, O, N) to be very accurately mapped. Most protein structures solved today have a resolution of 1.5 to 2.5 Angstroms, which means the hydrogen atoms are not visible and there is some uncertainty in the precise location of the heavy atoms. Protein structures with a resolution of >2.5 Angstroms generally have a number of coordinate inaccuracies as well as other structural problems. When the resolution is greater than 3.5 Angstroms, there is often considerable uncertainty in both the atom locations and even the identity of individual amino residues. In other words, resolution is inversely correlated with structure quality (i.e. higher numbers mean poorer structures). This trend in protein structure quality for X-ray resolution matches very closely to the trend seen the quality of NMR-determined protein structures. Some NMR structures have large numbers of constraints (NOEs, H-bonds, J-couplings, dipolar couplings), excellent geometry, high structure quality and very tight ensembles with excellent atomic precision (RMSDs < 1 Angstrom). Other NMR structures have very few constraints, poor geometry or poor structure quality and very loose ensembles (RMSDs > 3 Angstroms). However, there is no simple mapping between NMR RMSD values and X-ray resolution values. That is, an NMR ensemble with 1 Angstrom RMSD does not correspond in quality or precision to an X-ray structure with 1 Angstrom resolution. This is because the RMSD measure is both a function of the number of structures used in the ensemble and the selection bias of the spectroscopist who desposits the structural ensemble. Likewise, in NMR it is possible to generate high quality, precisely determined protein structures using relatively few, well-chosen constraints. It is also possible to generate very low quality NMR structures from large numbers of carelessly assessed, mistaken or mis-assigned constraints.",

The force fields have been applied successfully for protein structure refinement in different X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy applications, especially using program XPLOR. However, such refinement is driven mainly by a set of experimental constraints, whereas the interatomic potentials serve merely to remove interatomic hindrances. The results of calculations are practically the same with rigid sphere potentials implemented in program DYANA (calculations from NMR data), or with programs for crystallographic refinement that do not use any energy functions. The deficiencies of the interatomic potentials remain a major bottleneck in homology modeling of proteins.

It was initially hypothesized that general anaesthetic binds to its target ion channel by a key-lock mechanism and changes its structure dramatically from open to closed conformation or vice versa. However, there is a significant amount of evidence against direct key-lock interaction of membrane proteins with general anaesthetics Various studies have shown that low affinity drugs including inhaled general anaesthetics do not usually interact with their target proteins via specific lock-and-key binding mechanism because they do not change molecular structures of transmembrane receptors, ion channels and globular proteins. Based on these experimental facts and some computer simulations modern version of protein hypothesis was proposed. Proteins of four-\u03b1-helix bundle structural motif served as models of monomer of pentameric Cys-loop receptor because binding pockets of inhaled anaesthetics are believed to be within transmembrane four-\u03b1-helix bundles of Cys-loop receptors. Inhaled general anaesthetic does not change structure of membrane channel but changes its dynamics especially dynamics in the flexible loops that connect \u03b1-helices in a bundle and are exposed to the membrane-water interface. It is a well known fact that dynamics of protein in microsecond-millisecond timescale is often coupled with functions of the protein. Thus it was logical to propose that since inhaled general anaesthetics do not change protein structure they may exert their effect on proteins by modulating protein dynamics in a slow microsecond-millisecond timescale and/or by disrupting the modes of motion essential for function of this protein. Normal interactions between residues in protein regions (loops) at the water-lipid interface that play critical roles in protein functions and agonist binding may be disrupted by general anaesthetic. Interactions within the same loop or between different loops may be disrupted by anaesthetics and ultimately functions of Cys-loop receptors may be altered.",

Given the myriad uses that biological systems have for proteins, though, research into understanding protein folding is of high importance and could prove fruitful for bionanotechnology in the future.",

Viral membrane fusion proteins act as catalysts to overcome this high energy barrier. Following viral glycoprotein binding to cellular receptors, viral membrane fusion proteins undergo a change in structure conformation. This change in conformation then facilitates the destabilization and fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane by allowing fusion loops (FLs) or hydrophobic fusion peptides (FPs) on the viral envelope to interact with the cell membrane. Most viral membrane fusion proteins would end up in a hairpin-like conformation after fusion, in which FLs/FPs and the transmembrane domain are all on the same side of the protein.",

The group is multidisciplinary and draws on a range of specialisms including, biology, chemistry, engineering, physics and computational modelling to help develop understanding of the structure function relationships used by amphiphilic bioactive molecules. The term \u2018\u2018peptide-amphiphile\u2019\u2019 can be used to describe amphiphilic peptides consisting only of amino acids that show segregation of charged and uncharged components within the primary or secondary structure. Alternatively, they may be composed of hydrophilic peptides linked to hydrophobic alkyl chains or lipids, and peptide-based copolymers. Such molecules are of significant biological importance due to the range of asymmetric boundaries that occur in nature such as those found at a membrane lipid interface. Amphiphilic protein sequences can be involved in protein targeting, membrane protein assembly as well as membrane fusion and lysis. In addition to amphiphilic peptides possessing key biological functions amphiphiles are becoming of increasing interest in the creation of new biomaterials. Amphiphiles can self-assemble into a variety of different structures such as micelles, vesicles, monolayers, bilayers, nanofibers, nanotapes, ribbons, and twisted ribbons, to minimise unfavorable interactions with their surroundings.

In Oxford, newly developed wide-line NMR was developed to characterize surface specificity of lipid-protein and peptide interactions in membranes. More recently, novel solid state NMR approaches have been developed and exploited to resolve high resolution conformational and dynamic details directly of ligand-targets interactions in the absence of target structure, with GPCRs being the current focus.

Fzo1 (P38297) and Mgm1 (P32266) are conserved guanosine triphosphatases that reside in the outer and inner membranes, respectively. At each membrane, these conserved proteins are required for the distinct steps of membrane tethering and lipid mixing. The third essential component is Ugo1, an outer membrane protein with a region homologous to but distantly related to a region in the Mitochondrial Carrier (MC) family. Hoppins \"et al.\", 2009 showed that Ugo1 is a modified member of this family, containing three transmembrane domains and existing as a dimer, a structure that is critical for the fusion function of Ugo1. Their analyses of Ugo1 indicate that it is required for both outer and inner membrane fusion after membrane tethering, indicating that it operates at the lipid-mixing step of fusion. This role is distinct from the fusion dynamin-related proteins and thus demonstrates that at each membrane, a single fusion protein is not sufficient to drive the lipid-mixing step. Instead, this step requires a more complex assembly of proteins. The formation of a fusion pore has not yet been demonstrated. The Ugo1 protein is a member of the MC superfamily.",

            "document": "Fences and pickets model of plasma membrane structure . Receptor redistribution and clustering are key steps in many signal transduction pathways. Several reports have indicated the active roles played by the cytoskeleton in inhibiting or enabling the redistribution/clustering of membrane molecules. Receptor monomers can hop across the inter-compartment boundaries quite readily, but when they form oligomers upon liganding, their size increases and consequently their hop rate decreases dramatically.  Many receptors and other membrane-associated molecules are temporarily immobilized on actin filaments. This imobilization is often enhanced upon receptor engagement, and constitutes a key step for recruiting the downstream signaling molecule. Meanwhile, the formation of engaged receptor clusters might lead to de novo polymerization of actin filaments at the receptor cluster. As such, the actin-based membrane skeleton might work as a base scaffold for enhancing the interactions between the receptor and the actin-bound downstream molecules and for localized signaling. The \u2018\u2018pickets\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018fences\u2019\u2019 made of the membrane skeleton and the anchored transmembrane proteins provide the cell with a mechanism for preserving the spatial information of signal transduction in the membranewhereas pickets would influence both lipids and transmembrane proteins. Pickets influence both lipids and transmembrane proteins traffic, whereas fences mostly influence only transmembrane proteins. Therefore, transmembrane proteins are corralled by both fences and pickets. In both models, membrane proteins and lipids can hop from a compartment to an adjacent one, probably when thermal fluctuations of the membrane and the membrane skeleton create a space between them large enough to allow the passage of integral membrane proteins, when an actin filament temporarily breaks, and/or when membrane molecules have sufficient kinetic energy to cross the barrier when they are in the boundary region.",
