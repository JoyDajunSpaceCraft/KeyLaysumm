The electrical aspect depends on properties of the neuron's membrane. Like all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it. A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that actively transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.",

It was initially hypothesized that general anaesthetic binds to its target ion channel by a key-lock mechanism and changes its structure dramatically from open to closed conformation or vice versa. However, there is a significant amount of evidence against direct key-lock interaction of membrane proteins with general anaesthetics Various studies have shown that low affinity drugs including inhaled general anaesthetics do not usually interact with their target proteins via specific lock-and-key binding mechanism because they do not change molecular structures of transmembrane receptors, ion channels and globular proteins. Based on these experimental facts and some computer simulations modern version of protein hypothesis was proposed. Proteins of four-\u03b1-helix bundle structural motif served as models of monomer of pentameric Cys-loop receptor because binding pockets of inhaled anaesthetics are believed to be within transmembrane four-\u03b1-helix bundles of Cys-loop receptors. Inhaled general anaesthetic does not change structure of membrane channel but changes its dynamics especially dynamics in the flexible loops that connect \u03b1-helices in a bundle and are exposed to the membrane-water interface. It is a well known fact that dynamics of protein in microsecond-millisecond timescale is often coupled with functions of the protein. Thus it was logical to propose that since inhaled general anaesthetics do not change protein structure they may exert their effect on proteins by modulating protein dynamics in a slow microsecond-millisecond timescale and/or by disrupting the modes of motion essential for function of this protein. Normal interactions between residues in protein regions (loops) at the water-lipid interface that play critical roles in protein functions and agonist binding may be disrupted by general anaesthetic. Interactions within the same loop or between different loops may be disrupted by anaesthetics and ultimately functions of Cys-loop receptors may be altered.",

Upon opening of the channel, conformational changes in the voltage-sensor domains (VSD) result in the transfer of 12-13 elementary charges across the membrane electric field. This charge transfer is measured as a transient capacitive current that precedes opening of the channel. Several charged residues of the VSD, in particular four arginine residues located regularly at every third position on the S4 segment, are known to move across the transmembrane field and contribute to the gating charge. The position of these arginines, known as gating arginines, are highly conserved in all voltage-gated potassium, sodium, or calcium channels. However, the extent of their movement and their displacement across the transmembrane potential has been subject to extensive debate. Specific domains of the channel subunits have been identified that are responsible for voltage-sensing and converting between the open and closed conformations of the channel. There are at least two closed conformations. In the first, the channel can open if the membrane potential becomes more positive. This type of gating is mediated by a voltage-sensing domain that consists of the S4 alpha helix that contains 6\u20137 positive charges. Changes in membrane potential cause this alpha helix to move in the lipid bilayer. This movement in turn results in a conformational change in the adjacent S5\u2013S6 helices that form the channel pore and cause this pore to open or close. In the second, \"N-type\" inactivation, voltage-gated K channels inactivate after opening, entering a distinctive, closed conformation. In this inactivated conformation, the channel cannot open, even if the transmembrane voltage is favorable. The amino terminal domain of the K channel or an auxiliary protein can mediate \"N-type\" inactivation. The mechanism of this type of inactivation has been described as a \"ball and chain\" model, where the N-terminus of the protein forms a ball that is tethered to the rest of the protein through a loop (the chain). The tethered ball blocks the inner porehole, preventing ion movement through the channel.",

First, the transport relies on molecular binding between the cargo and the membrane-embedded channel or carrier protein. Second, the rate of facilitated diffusion is saturable with respect to the concentration difference between the two phases; unlike free diffusion which is linear in the concentration difference. Third, the temperature dependence of facilitated transport is substantially different due to the presence of an activated binding event, as compared to free diffusion where the dependence on temperature is mild. Polar molecules and large ions dissolved in water cannot diffuse freely across the plasma membrane due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid tails of the phospholipids that make up the lipid bilayer. Only small, non-polar molecules, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, can diffuse easily across the membrane. Hence, no nonpolar molecules are transported by proteins in the form of transmembrane channels. These channels are gated, meaning that they open and close, and thus deregulate the flow of ions or small polar molecules across membranes, sometimes against the osmotic gradient. Larger molecules are transported by transmembrane carrier proteins, such as permeases, that change their conformation as the molecules are carried across (e.g. glucose or amino acids).  Non-polar molecules, such as retinol or lipids, are poorly soluble in water. They are transported through aqueous compartments of cells or through extracellular space by water-soluble carriers (e.g. retinol binding protein). The metabolites are not altered because no energy is required for facilitated diffusion. Only permease changes its shape in order to transport metabolites. The form of transport through a cell membrane in which a metabolite is modified is called group translocation transportation.",

The inactivated state is mainly achieved through fast inactivation, by which a channel transitions rapidly from an open to an inactivated state. The model proposes that the inactivated state, which is stable and non-conducting, is caused by the physical blockage of the pore. The blockage is caused by a \"ball\" of amino acids connected to the main protein by a string of residues on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The ball enters the open channel and binds to the hydrophobic inner vestibule within the channel. This blockage causes inactivation of the channel by stopping the flow of ions.

Transmitters typically bind at the junction between two of these proteins, on the parts that protrude from the cell membrane.

This then causes more channels to open, producing a greater electric current across the cell membrane, and so on.

This binding results in a sodium-ion channel that stays open longer. Aconitine suppresses the conformational change in the sodium-ion channel from the active state to the inactive state. The membrane stays depolarized due to the constant sodium influx (which is 10-1000 fold greater than the potassium efflux). As a result, the membrane cannot be repolarized. The binding of aconitine to the channel also leads to the channel to change conformation from the inactive state to the active state at a more negative voltage. In neurons, aconitine increases the permeability of the membrane for sodium ions, resulting in a huge sodium influx in the axon terminal. As a result, the membrane depolarizes rapidly. Due to the strong depolarization, the permeability of the membrane for potassium ions increases fast, resulting in a potassium reflux to release the positive charge out of the cell. Not only the permeability for potassium ions but also the permeability for calcium ions increases as a result of the depolarization of the membrane. A calcium influx takes place. The increase of the calcium concentration in the cell stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic membrane to open the sodium-channels there, generating a new action potential.",

In most cases, however, the relationship between membrane potential and channel state is probabilistic and involves a time delay. Ion channels switch between conformations at unpredictable times: The membrane potential determines the rate of transitions and the probability per unit time of each type of transition. Voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops: The membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels, but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential. Thus, in some situations, a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open, thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential. An action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle proceeds explosively. The time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it. Several types of channels capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential do exist. Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the fast action potentials involved in nerve conduction. Slower action potentials in muscle cells and some types of neurons are generated by voltage-gated calcium channels.

A possible explanation is an interaction of azimilide with K close to its binding site in the ion channel. However, there is an agonist effect as well, which is a voltage-dependent effect. This is a dual effect, a low voltage depolarization near the activation threshold will increase the current amplitude and higher depolarizing voltages will suppress the current amplitude. The effect comes from outside of the cell membrane and does not depend on G-proteins or kinase activity inside the cell.

Certain of these PUFA-cyclopentenones  bind to the sulfur residues in the KEAP1 component of the KEAP1-NFE2L2 protein complex in the cytosol of cells. This negates KEAP1's ability to bind NFE2L2; in consequence, NFE2L2 becomes free to translocate to the nuclease and stimulate the transcription of genes that encode proteins active in detoxifying reactive oxygen species; this effect tends to reduce inflammatory reactions. PUFA-cyclopentenones may likewise react with the IKK2 component of the cytosolic IKK2-NF\u03baB protein complex thereby inhibiting NF\u03baB from stimulating the transcription of genes that encode various pro-inflammatory proteins. One or both of these mechanisms appears to contribute to the ability of certain highly reactive PUFA-cyclopenetenones to exhibit SPM activity. The PUFA-cyclopentenones include two prostaglandins, (PG) \u039412-PGJ2 and 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-PGJ2, and two isoprostanes, 5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2 and 5,6-epoxyisoprostane A2.

Both isoprostanes form non-enzymatically as a result the attack on the arachidonic acid bond to cellular phospholipids by reactive oxygen species; they are then release from the phospholipids to become free in attacking their target proteins.

Hepoxilins have various biological activities in animal models and/or cultured mammalian (including human) tissues and cells. The TrX metabolites of HxA3 and HxB3 have less or no activity in most of the systems studied but in some systems retain the activity of their precursor hepoxilins. Based on these studies, it has been proposed that the hepoxilins and trioxilins function in human physiology and pathology by, for example, promoting inflammation responses and dilating arteries to regulate regional blood flow and blood pressure.",

In addition to its activation, ALOX5 must gain access to its polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substrates, which commonly are bound in an ester linkage to the \"sn\"2 position of membrane phospholipids (see phospholipid), in order to form biologically active products. This is accomplished by a large family of phospholipase A2 (PLA) enzymes. The cytosolic PLA set (i.e. cPLAs) of PLA enzymes (cPLA2; see Phospholipase A2#Cytosolic phospholipases A2) in particular mediates many instances of stimulus-induced release of PUFA in inflammatory cells. For example, chemotactic factors stimulate human neutrophils to raise cytosolic Ca which triggers cPLAs, particularly the \u03b1 isoform (cPLA\u03b1), to move from its normal residence in the cytosol to cellular membranes. This chemotactic factor stimulation concurrently causes the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) which in turn stimulates the activity of cPLA\u03b1 by phosphorylating it on ser-505 (other cell types may activate this or other cPLA isoforms using other kinases which phosphorylate them on different serine residues). These two events allow cPLAs to release PUFA esterified to membrane phospholipids to FLAP which then presents them to ALOX5 for their metabolism.",

            "document": "Theories of general anaesthetic action . It was initially hypothesized that general anaesthetic binds to its target ion channel by a key-lock mechanism and changes its structure dramatically from open to closed conformation or vice versa. However, there is a significant amount of evidence against direct key-lock interaction of membrane proteins with general anaesthetics Various studies have shown that low affinity drugs including inhaled general anaesthetics do not usually interact with their target proteins via specific lock-and-key binding mechanism because they do not change molecular structures of transmembrane receptors, ion channels and globular proteins. Based on these experimental facts and some computer simulations modern version of protein hypothesis was proposed. Proteins of four-\u03b1-helix bundle structural motif served as models of monomer of pentameric Cys-loop receptor because binding pockets of inhaled anaesthetics are believed to be within transmembrane four-\u03b1-helix bundles of Cys-loop receptors. Inhaled general anaesthetic does not change structure of membrane channel but changes its dynamics especially dynamics in the flexible loops that connect \u03b1-helices in a bundle and are exposed to the membrane-water interface. It is a well known fact that dynamics of protein in microsecond-millisecond timescale is often coupled with functions of the protein. Thus it was logical to propose that since inhaled general anaesthetics do not change protein structure they may exert their effect on proteins by modulating protein dynamics in a slow microsecond-millisecond timescale and/or by disrupting the modes of motion essential for function of this protein. Normal interactions between residues in protein regions (loops) at the water-lipid interface that play critical roles in protein functions and agonist binding may be disrupted by general anaesthetic. Interactions within the same loop or between different loops may be disrupted by anaesthetics and ultimately functions of Cys-loop receptors may be altered.",

Potassium channels, similar to other cation-selective channels, are believed to have a cloud of negative charges that precede the opening to the channel pore that help conduct potassium ions through the permeation pathway. It is generally believed (though not proven) that a dendrotoxin molecules bind to anionic sites near the extracellular surface of the channel and physically occlude the pore, thereby preventing ion conductance. However, Imredy and MacKinnon have proposed that delta-dendrotoxin may have an off-center binding site on their target proteins, and may inhibit the channel by altering the structure of the channel, rather than physically blocking the pore.",

The location of fatty acid translocase (FAT) and fatty acid transporter protein (FATP) on both sides of the bipolar placental trophoblast cells and the lack of specificity for particular types of free fatty acids (FFA) allows transport by all FFAs (non-essential, essential and long-chain PUFAs) bidirectionally, i.e. from the mother to the fetus and vice versa. Whereas, by virtue of its exclusive location on maternal side of placental trophoblasts and its preference for long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), placenta specific plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein ( p-FABPpm) sequesters maternal plasma DHA/ARA to the placenta for fetal supply. Placental supply of DHA/ARA is critical for fetal brain development in utero. Cytoplasmic fatty acid-binidng proteins (FABPs) are responsible for transcytoplasmic movement of FFAs to their sites of esterification, \u00df-oxidation, or to the fetal circulation via placental basal membranes (Figure 2).
