            "document": "Chagas disease . Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protist \"Trypanosoma cruzi\". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae, or \"kissing bugs\". The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 8\u201312 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60\u201370% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \"T. cruzi\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \"kissing bugs\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \"vinchuca\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \"barbeiro\" (the barber) in Brazil, \"pito\" in Colombia, \"chinche\" in Central America, and \"chipo\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \"T. cruzi\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. This may involve the use of insecticides or bed-nets. Other preventive efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end\u2013stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation. It is estimated that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths. Most people with the disease are poor, and most do not realize they are infected. Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen an increase in the years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease. It affects more than 150 other animals.",

IL-10 shares similar immunomodulating mechanisms to TGF-\u03b2. It is thought that both cytokines reduce the rate of apoptosis in human alveolar macrophages, thus indirectly enhancing alveolar macrophage-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation. There is a significant increase in the basal rate of apoptosis upon activation by bacterial products. Apoptosis is particularly regulated by the presence of cytokines: IFN-\u03b3 increases the rate of apoptosis, whereas IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 decrease it. However, IL-10 has counterproductive effects on the immune system, and has been shown to actually promote infection by foreign pathogens. The role of IL-10 in bacterial and parasitic infection has been discovered as a strategy to evade host immune systems. There are bacteria which parasitize AMs by invading through their membranes, and thrive by growing and replicating inside of them, exploiting AMs as host cells. Normally, this infection can be eliminated by T-cells, which activate enzymes in alveolar macrophages that destroy the bacteria; but these bacteria have been shown to alter the cytokine signaling network to their advantage. As an inhibitory cytokine, IL-10 facilitates the infection of human alveolar macrophages and monocytes by completely reversing the protective effect of IFN-\u03b3 against intracellular Legionella pneumophila replication. Yersinia enterocolitica has also been shown to releases virulence antigen LcrV, which induces IL-10 through Toll-like receptor-2 and CD14 (an accessory surface protein of TLR4-mediated LPS-signaling), resulting in the suppression of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-alpha suppression.",

It is caused by protozoa of the species \"Trypanosoma brucei\". There are two types that infect humans, \"Trypanosoma brucei gambiense\" (TbG) and \"Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense\" (TbR). TbG causes over 98% of reported cases. Both are usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and are most common in rural areas. Initially, in the first stage of the disease, there are fevers, headaches, itchiness and joint pains. This begins one to three weeks after the bite. Weeks to months later the second stage begins with confusion, poor coordination, numbness and trouble sleeping. Diagnosis is via finding the parasite in a blood smear or in the fluid of a lymph node. A lumbar puncture is often needed to tell the difference between first and second stage disease. Prevention of severe disease involves screening the population at risk with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage is with the medications pentamidine or suramin. Treatment of the second stage involves eflornithine or a combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine for TbG. While melarsoprol works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death. The disease occurs regularly in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa with the population at risk being about 70 million in 36 countries. An estimated 11,000 people are currently infected with 2,800 new infections in 2015. In 2015 it caused around 3,500 deaths, down from 34,000 in 1990. More than 80% of these cases are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Three major outbreaks have occurred in recent history: one from 1896 to 1906 primarily in Uganda and the Congo Basin and two in 1920 and 1970 in several African countries.

At this point, some species of \"Plasmodium\" of primates can form a long-lived dormant stage called a hypnozoite. It can remain in the liver for more than a year. However, for most \"Plasmodium\" species, the parasites in infected liver cells are only what are called merozoites. After emerging from the liver, they enter red blood cells, as explained above. They then go through continuous cycles of erythrocyte infection, while a small percentage of parasites differentiate into a sexual stage called a gametocyte which is picked up by an insect host taking a blood meal. In some hosts, invasion of erythrocytes by \"Plasmodium\" species can result in disease, called malaria.

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the \"Plasmodium\" type. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. The disease is most commonly transmitted by an infected female \"Anopheles\" mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of \"Plasmodium\" can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by \"P.\u00a0falciparum\" because \"P.\u00a0vivax\", \"P.\u00a0ovale\", and \"P.\u00a0malariae\" generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species \"P.\u00a0knowlesi\" rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity. The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant \"P.\u00a0falciparum\" has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia. The disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator. This includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2016, there were 216 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa. Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.",

Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, it may cause poor growth and learning difficulty. The disease is spread by contact with fresh water contaminated with the parasites. These parasites are released from infected freshwater snails. The disease is especially common among children in developing countries as they are more likely to play in contaminated water. Other high risk groups include farmers, fishermen, and people using unclean water during daily living. It belongs to the group of helminth infections. Diagnosis is by finding eggs of the parasite in a person's urine or stool. It can also be confirmed by finding antibodies against the disease in the blood. Methods to prevent the disease include improving access to clean water and reducing the number of snails. In areas where the disease is common, the medication praziquantel may be given once a year to the entire group. This is done to decrease the number of people infected and, consequently, the spread of the disease. Praziquantel is also the treatment recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for those who are known to be infected. Schistosomiasis affected about 252 million people worldwide in 2015.

In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent \"T. cruzi\", an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of \"T. cruzi\" within its gut.",

The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose, and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever, low red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver. Infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of \"Leishmania\". Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation, and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under the microscope. Additionally, visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests. Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of \"Leishmania\", and the type of infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective. About 4 to 12 million people are currently infected in some 98 countries. About 2 million new cases and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year. About 200\u00a0million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common.

In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 8\u201312 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60\u201370% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \"T. cruzi\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \"kissing bugs\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \"vinchuca\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \"barbeiro\" (the barber) in Brazil, \"pito\" in Colombia, \"chinche\" in Central America, and \"chipo\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \"T. cruzi\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. This may involve the use of insecticides or bed-nets. Other preventive efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end\u2013stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.

Further, RNA can adopt discrete secondary or tertiary structures which play a pivotal role in many biological processes and disease pathology. For these reasons, RNA is being recognized as an attractive drug target for small molecules.",

Later chemical libraries of synthetic small molecules, natural products or extracts were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology. Since sequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use high throughput screening of large compounds libraries against isolated biological targets which are hypothesized to be disease modifying in a process known as reverse pharmacology. Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for efficacy. Even more recently, scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level, and to use that knowledge to design (see drug design) drug candidates.",

            "document": "RNA-targeting small molecule drugs . Aside from studies involved r(CUG) repeats, other complex RNA structures have also been targeted. Pearson and coworkers discovered that a cationic porphyrin (TMPyP4) bound a G-quadruplex r(GC) and inhibited the binding of proteins to r(GC). Work by Disney and Petrucelli rationally identified small molecules that can target this repeat and affect disease biology in model cellular systems and also in patient-derive iNeurons. Further studies by Rothstein and colleagues determined that TMPyP4 could suppress r(GC)-mediated neurodegeneration in a \"Drosophila\" model. Additionally targets have been rationally identified by using a powerful seqecune-based design approach termed informal to identify dozens of bioactive small molecules that target disease causing non-coding RNA termed INFORNA. This study important showed for the first time that small molecules appear to have selectivities that are competitive with oligonucleotides with cell-permeable and medicinally optimizable small molecules. Additionally, compounds have been shown to be bioactive in diverse disease settings that ranged from breast cancer. and hepatocellular carcinoma. More recently, the Disney group further used their prediction database INFORNA to design Targaprimir-96 to target miRNA precursors in animal models of cancer, the first small molecules to do so. This compound has a nanomolar affinity for the miRNA hairpin precursor selectively over other sequences. Targaprimir-96 was further tested in cells and in mice, inhibiting tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of triple negative breast cancer upon i.p. injection. RNA-targeting small molecule drug discovery has greatly benefitted from the available cellular models for disease. The use of cell culture in early development has become a requirement for assessing the basic efficacy of a drug candidate. Thus, more research groups have implemented these techniques in their programs. In a leading example, Al-Hashimi and coworkers identified six small molecules with high affinity for TAR of HIV-1 through a computational approach. They docked a library of small molecules onto RNA dynamic structures generated by NMR and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The hit molecules inhibited the Tat\u2014TAR interaction \"in vitro\". They arrived at lead molecule, netilmicin, that had the best selectivity for HIV-1 TAR and inhibited HIV-1 replication in cells with a low IC50. The Disney group has studied aminoglycoside derivatives in 2009 for their ability to inhibit interactions between repeat RNA and proteins. Using their prediction database INFORNA, they discovered that a compound could bind to 1 x 1 UU internal loops on an N-methyl peptide backbone. They confirmed that like other compounds that target DM1 r(CUG), they could inhibit the complex between r(CUG)-MBNL1, disrupt nuclear foci, and increase nucleocytoplasmic transport of the gene in patient-derived DM1 fibroblasts. In that study the Disney group also described several approaches to validate the RNA targets of small molecules. In the first approach termed chemical cross-linking and isolation by pull down (Chem-CLIP) and chemical cross-linking and isolation by pull down to map binding sites (Chem-CLIP-Map).",

The ability to demonstrate proof of concept for target modulation in patients has also been encouraging, as has the early evidence of clinical activity in melanoma 17-AAG is now in Phase II studies as a single agent and combination studies with cytotoxic and other agents such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib are also underway. Improved formulations for parenteral use are also being evaluated in the clinic. Radicicol-based inhibitors have not entered clinical development. Following on from the initial proof of concept studies with the natural product agents, considerable progress has been made in the preclinical development of small molecule, synthetic inhibitors, as exemplified by the purine and pyrazole based compounds. The recent rapid progress has built on a wealth of knowledge obtained with the natural product inhibitors and is a good example of the value of chemical biology studies in which the biological activity is identified first and then the molecular target is discovered by detailed biological studies. Current medicinal chemistry activities are focusing on the combined use of high throughput screening and structure-based design, coupled to the evaluation of the compounds in robust and mechanistically- informative biological assays. The next decade will be exciting in the HSP90 field as the clinical activity of the early geldanamycin-based drugs is rigorously evaluated while a series of synthetic small-molecule agents enter preclinical and clinical development. Particular areas of interest will include the potential for orally active HSP90 inhibitors and for the development of isoform-selective drugs that are targeted to particular members of the HSP90 family (DMAG \u2013N-OXIDE). HSP90 inhibitors may also be evaluated in diseases other than cancer and where protein folding defects are involved in the disease pathology.

They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with a relatively low dose to other tissues. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind.

These molecules were only modestly selective and showed unfavorable toxicity levels at relevant therapeutic concentrations. As another strategy for targeting RNA, antisense oligonucleotides were developed which have been pushed forward through the clinic for several diseases. By this principle, if one can identify an RNA involved in disease then the sequence can be used to design a complimentary antisense oligonucleotide, and that agent can be introduced into cells to treat the disease. But, this approach in its basic form has been met with several challenges. The most obvious are their large size and propensity to degradation by nucleases. In order for cellular RNA to be effective it must enter the cells intact. While backbone modifications to antisense oligonucleotides in order to prevent nuclease degradation have been shown to work, this approach is still somewhat limited. Small molecules may present a better way to target RNA and subsequently DNA because they can be designed to be more \u201cdrug-like\u201d and have a better chance of reaching their target, most by oral administration.

The biological activity of these low-weight compounds, constituting up to 90% of the pharmaceutical market (by nomenclature), in most cases is governed by their interactions with biological targets via either covalent or supramolecular bonding. The selectivity and specificity of these interactions determine the potential of the low-weight chemical compounds in drug therapy (for example, in the cases of the virus infections and the neurodegenerative diseases).
