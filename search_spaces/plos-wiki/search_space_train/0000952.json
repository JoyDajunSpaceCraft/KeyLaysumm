Perception of karrikins by Arabidopsis requires an alpha/beta-fold hydrolase named KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE-2 (KAI2). The KAI2 protein has a catalytic triad of amino acids which is essential for activity, consistent with the hypothesis that KAI2 hydrolyses its ligand. This model is consistent with the perception of the chemically related strigolactone hormones which involves hydrolysis by their receptor protein DWARF14, an alpha/beta hydrolase related to KAI2. The question of whether karrikins act directly in plants is controversial. While some studies suggest that karrikins can bind directly to KAI2 protein, others do not support this. It is possible that karrikins produced by wildfires are converted to a different compound by the plant, before interaction with KAI2. The ability of different plants to carry out this conversion could partly explain differences in their ability to respond to karrikins and to smoke.",

Drought tolerance of plants is mediated by several mechanisms that work together, including stabilizing and protecting the plant from damage caused by desiccation and also controlling how much water plants lose through the stomatal pores during drought. A plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), is produced in response to drought. A major type of ABA receptor has been identified. Future research is needed to test if these receptors can be used to engineer drought tolerance in plants. The plant hormone ABA causes the stomatal pores to close in response to drought, which reduces plant water loss via transpiration to the atmosphere and allows plants to avoid or slow down water loss during droughts. The use of drought tolerant crop plants would lead to a reduction in crop losses during droughts. Since guard cells control water loss of plants, the investigation on how stomatal opening and closure are regulated could lead to the development of plants with improved avoidance or slowing of desiccation and better water use efficiency.",

This is due to water's necessity in so many fundamental processes in plant growth. It has become especially important in recent years to find a way to combat drought stress. A decrease in precipitation and subsequent increase in drought are extremely likely in the future due to an increase in global warming. Plants have come up with many mechanisms and adaptations to try and deal with drought stress. One of the leading ways that plants combat drought stress is by closing their stomates . A key hormone regulating stomatal opening and closing is abscisic acid (ABA). Synthesis of ABA causes the ABA to bind to receptors. This binding then effects the opening of ion channels thereby decreasing turgor pressure in the stomata and causing them to close. Recent studies, by Gonzalez-Villagra, et al, showed how ABA levels increased in drought-stressed plants (2018). They showed that when plants were placed in a stressful situation they produced more ABA to try and conserve any water they had in their leaves . Another extremely important factor in dealing with drought stress and regulating the uptake and export of water is aquaporins (AQPs). AQPs are integral membrane proteins that make up channels. These channel's main job is the transport of water and other necessary solutes . AQPs are both transcriptionally and post transcriptionally regulated by many different factors such as ABA, GA3, pH and Ca2+ and the specific levels of AQPs in certain parts of the plant, such as roots or leaves, helps to draw as much water into the plant as possible . By understanding both the mechanism of AQPs and the hormone ABA, scientists will be better able to produce drought resistant plants in the future.",

The protein has since been referred to as dehydrin and has been the identified as the genetic basis of drought tolerance in plants. However, the first direct genetic evidence of dehydrin playing a role in cellular protection during osmotic shock was not observed until 2005, in the moss, \"Physcomitrella patens\". In order to show a direct correlation between DHN and stress recovery, a knockout gene was created, which interfered with DHNA\u2019s functionality. After being placed in an environment with salt and osmotic stress and then later being returned to a standard growth medium, the \"P. patens\" wildtype was able to recover to 94% of its fresh weight while the P. patens mutant only reached 39% of its fresh weight. This study also concludes that DHN production allows plants to function in high salt concentrations. Another study found evidence of DHN\u2019s impact in drought-stress recovery by showing that transcription levels of a DHN increased in a drought-tolerant pine, \"Pinus pinaster\", when placed in a drought treatment. However, transcription levels of a DHN decreased in the same drought treatment in a drought-sensitive \"P. pinaster\". Drought-tolerance is a complex trait, thus that it cannot be genetically analyzed as a single gene trait. The exact mechanism of drought tolerance is yet to be determined and is still being researched. One chemical mechanism related to DHN production is the presence of the phytohormone ABA. One common response to environmental stresses is process known as cellular dehydration. Cellular dehydration induces biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), which is known to react as a stress hormone because of its accumulation in the plant under water stress conditions. ABA also participates in stress signal transduction pathways ABA has been shown to increase the production of DHN, which provides more evidence of a link between DHN and drought tolerance.",

Guard cells also provide an excellent model for basic studies on how a cell integrates numerous kinds of input signals to produce a response (stomatal opening or closing).

The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant\u2019s resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures. A number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants. During times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy.

PYR1 normally binds to abscisic acid which together then bind and inactivate to PP2C as a drought stress response, which stops PP2C from deactivating SnRK2. This causes a cascade that leads to the activation of the slow anion channel 1 and closing of the leaf guard cells and stomata. The result is less water loss by the plant. The natural response by the plant using abscisic acid to bind PYR1 in drought conditions is not strong enough and is activated too late to significantly hinder crop yield loss. Abscisic acid is also currently too expensive to synthesize to be used as a spray to control drought response artificially on a mass scale. The ability to control this externally by spraying the PYR1 (orthogonal receptor) with mandipropamid (orthogonal ligand and fungicide) has the potential to reduce crop yield loss during droughts in plants with these engineered receptors, and has been confirmed to work in canola.",

A plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), is produced in response to drought. A major type of ABA receptor has been identified. Future research is needed to test if these receptors can be used to engineer drought tolerance in plants. The plant hormone ABA causes the stomatal pores to close in response to drought, which reduces plant water loss via transpiration to the atmosphere and allows plants to avoid or slow down water loss during droughts. The use of drought tolerant crop plants would lead to a reduction in crop losses during droughts. Since guard cells control water loss of plants, the investigation on how stomatal opening and closure are regulated could lead to the development of plants with improved avoidance or slowing of desiccation and better water use efficiency.",

This is due to water's necessity in so many fundamental processes in plant growth. It has become especially important in recent years to find a way to combat drought stress. A decrease in precipitation and subsequent increase in drought are extremely likely in the future due to an increase in global warming. Plants have come up with many mechanisms and adaptations to try and deal with drought stress. One of the leading ways that plants combat drought stress is by closing their stomates . A key hormone regulating stomatal opening and closing is abscisic acid (ABA). Synthesis of ABA causes the ABA to bind to receptors. This binding then effects the opening of ion channels thereby decreasing turgor pressure in the stomata and causing them to close. Recent studies, by Gonzalez-Villagra, et al, showed how ABA levels increased in drought-stressed plants (2018). They showed that when plants were placed in a stressful situation they produced more ABA to try and conserve any water they had in their leaves . Another extremely important factor in dealing with drought stress and regulating the uptake and export of water is aquaporins (AQPs). AQPs are integral membrane proteins that make up channels. These channel's main job is the transport of water and other necessary solutes . AQPs are both transcriptionally and post transcriptionally regulated by many different factors such as ABA, GA3, pH and Ca2+ and the specific levels of AQPs in certain parts of the plant, such as roots or leaves, helps to draw as much water into the plant as possible . By understanding both the mechanism of AQPs and the hormone ABA, scientists will be better able to produce drought resistant plants in the future.",

The protein has since been referred to as dehydrin and has been the identified as the genetic basis of drought tolerance in plants. However, the first direct genetic evidence of dehydrin playing a role in cellular protection during osmotic shock was not observed until 2005, in the moss, \"Physcomitrella patens\". In order to show a direct correlation between DHN and stress recovery, a knockout gene was created, which interfered with DHNA\u2019s functionality. After being placed in an environment with salt and osmotic stress and then later being returned to a standard growth medium, the \"P. patens\" wildtype was able to recover to 94% of its fresh weight while the P. patens mutant only reached 39% of its fresh weight. This study also concludes that DHN production allows plants to function in high salt concentrations. Another study found evidence of DHN\u2019s impact in drought-stress recovery by showing that transcription levels of a DHN increased in a drought-tolerant pine, \"Pinus pinaster\", when placed in a drought treatment. However, transcription levels of a DHN decreased in the same drought treatment in a drought-sensitive \"P. pinaster\". Drought-tolerance is a complex trait, thus that it cannot be genetically analyzed as a single gene trait. The exact mechanism of drought tolerance is yet to be determined and is still being researched. One chemical mechanism related to DHN production is the presence of the phytohormone ABA. One common response to environmental stresses is process known as cellular dehydration. Cellular dehydration induces biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), which is known to react as a stress hormone because of its accumulation in the plant under water stress conditions. ABA also participates in stress signal transduction pathways ABA has been shown to increase the production of DHN, which provides more evidence of a link between DHN and drought tolerance.",

Plants have many protection mechanisms to cope with stresses from the environment, which include ultraviolet light, cold or hot weather, windy days, and mechanical wounding. There are multiple pathways, but one pathway that plants have been able to develop is a self-defense mechanism by recognize pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via cell surface-located pathogen-recognition receptors. These receptors induce intracellular signal pathways within the plant cells, while also resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity. Responses to PAMPs target broadly instead of specifically. This immunity requires downstream components via the MAPK cascade to activate the MAP kinases. The flagellin, a peptide of flg22, triggers a rapid and strong activation of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6. MPK4 and MPK6 can be activated by harpin proteins. MPK3 and MPK6 are very similar proteins and have a function as regulators in abscission, stomatal development, signaling various abiotic stresses, and defense responses to certain pathogens. Experimentation has proposed that the MAPK module MEKK1-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 may be responsible for flg22 signal transmission. All of the proposed modules appear to be correct expect for MEKK1 because plants with \"mekk1\" mutated have a compromised flg22-triggered activation of MPK4, yet they have normal activation of MPK3 and MPK6. Data has shown that MAPK cascade is composed of MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6 in response to fungal pathogens. The observation shows that the activation of MPK3/MPK6 in conditional gain-of-function plants for MKK4/MKK5 or MEKK1/MKKKa is sufficient to induce camalexin, which is a major phytoalexin in \"Arabidopsis.\" The stomata are considered to be the entry point for pathogenic invaders because microbial invaders enter the plant at the stomata. A recent study has shown that MAPK cascades play a role in abiotic and biotic stress responses. The main pathways in stomatal development and dynamics are MPK3 and MPK6. During a drought, the stomata closes and is believed to be mediated by the phytohormone, abscisic acid, and involves MKK1, MPK3, and MPK6. Another way of closing the stomata is through a closing process that is called pathogen-induced, which is an innate response from the plant. \"Campestris (Xcc)\" excretes a chemical that reverts stomatal closure that was caused by bacteria and abscisic acid (ABA). Most stomata close in the presents of ABA, but some are unresponsive to bacteria. In \"Arabidopsis\" \"Xcc\" does not revert bacteria-induced or ABA-induced stomatal closure. Scientists are not certain if MAPK cascades are responsible for the signaling, so further investigation is needed for this.",

            "document": "Stomatal conductance . Recent studies have looked at the stomatal conductance of fast growing tree species to identify the water use of various species. Through their research it was concluded that the predawn water potential of the leaf remained consistent throughout the months while the midday water potential of the leaf showed a variation due to the seasons. For example, canopy stomatal conductance had a higher water potential in July than in October. The studies conducted for this experiment determined that the stomatal conductance allowed for a constant water use per unit leaf area. Other studies have explored the relationship between drought stress and stomatal conductance. Through these experiments, researchers have found that a drought resistant plant regulates it's transpiration rate via stomatal conductance. This minimizes water loss and allows the plant to survive under low water conditions.",

Light signals are required for the induction and regulation of many developmental processes in plants. She has participated in research dissecting this complex process by isolating mutations that alter light-regulated seedling development in Arabidopsis. Her work has identified mutants that are deficient in the phytochrome photoreceptors and in nuclear-localized repressors and has also revealed that steroid hormones control light-regulated seedling development. Dr. Chory's lab has been involved in the manipulation of the biosynthetic pathway for these steroids that altered the growth and development of plants and identification of the putative steroid receptor, a transmembrane receptor kinase. Her group has also contributed towards the understanding of chloroplast to nuclear retrograde signaling and plant shade avoidance responses.",

Recent research breakthroughs in biotechnology have revived interest in targeted drought resistance breeding and use of new genomics tools to enhance crop water productivity. Marker-assisted breeding is revolutionising the improvement of temperate field crops and will have similar impacts on breeding of tropical crops. Other molecular breeding tool include development of genetically modified crops that can tolerate plant stress. As a complement to the recent rapid progress in genomics, a better understanding of physiological mechanisms of dehydration response will also contribute to the progress of genetic enhancement of crop drought resistance. It is now well accepted that the complexity of the dehydration syndrome can only be tackled with a holistic approach that integrates physiological dissection of crop dehydration avoidance and - tolerance traits using molecular genetic tools such as MAS, micro-arrays and transgenic crops, with agronomic practices that lead to better conservation and utilisation of soil moisture, and better matching of crop genotypes with the environment.",

With shifting climates comes shifting weather patterns, meaning that regions that could traditionally rely on a substantial amount of precipitation were, quite literally, left out to dry. In light of these conditions, drought resistance in major crop plants has become a clear priority. One method is to identify the genetic basis of drought resistance in naturally drought resistant plants, i.e. the Bambara groundnut. Next, transferring these advantages to otherwise vulnerable crop plants. Rice, which is one of the most vulnerable crops in terms of drought, has been successfully improved by the addition of the Barley hva1 gene into the genome using transgenetics. Drought resistance can also be improved through changes in a plant's root system architecture, such as a root orientation that maximizes water retention and nutrient uptake. There must be a continued focus on the efficient usage of available water on a planet that is expected to have a population in excess of nine-billion people by 2050.",

Many plant species, such as those in the family Cactaceae (or cacti), have drought tolerance adaptations like reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought. Some others survive dry periods as buried seeds. Semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands. Prolonged droughts have caused mass migrations and humanitarian crisis. Most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity. The most prolonged drought ever in the world in recorded history occurred in the Atacama Desert in Chile (400 Years).",

Other genes from various species have been inserted into the tomato with the hope of increasing their resistance to various environmental factors. A gene from rice (\"Osmyb4\"), which codes for a transcription factor, that was shown to increase cold and drought tolerance in transgenic \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" plants, was inserted into the tomato. This resulted in increased drought tolerance, but did not appear to have any effect on cold tolerance. Overexpressing a vacuolar Na/H antiport (\"AtNHX1\") from \"A. thaliana\" lead to salt accumulating in the leaves of the plants, but not in the fruit and allowed them to grow more in salt solutions than wildtype plants. They were the first salt-tolerant, edible plants ever created. Tobacco osmotic genes overexpressed in tomatoes produced plants that held a higher water content than wildtype plants increasing tolerance to drought and salt stress.",
