Unlike in eukaryotes, membrane vesicular trafficking in prokaryotes is an emerging area in interactive biology for intra-species (quorum sensing) and inter-species signaling at host-pathogen interface, as prokaryotes lack internal membrane-compartmentalization of their cytoplasm. For more than four decades, cultures of gram negative microbes revealed the presence of nanoscale membrane vesicles. A role for membrane vesicles in pathogenic processes has been suspected since the 1970s, when they were observed in gingival plaque by electron microscopy. These vesicles were suspected to promote bacterial adhesion to the host epithelial cell surface. Their role in invasion of animal host cells \"in vivo\" was then demonstrated. In inter-bacterial interactions, OMVs released by \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" microbes were shown to fuse with outer membrane of other gram negative microbes causing their bacteriolysis; these OMVs could lyse gram-positive microbes as well. Role of OMVs in \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection of \"human\" primary antral epithelial cells, as model that closely resembles human stomach, has also been confirmed VacA-containing OMVs could also be detected in human gastric mucosa, infected with \"H. pylori.\". \"Salmonella\" OMVs were also shown to have direct role in invasion of chicken ileal epithelial cells \"in vivo\" in the year, 1993 (ref 4) and later, in hijacking of defense macrophages into sub-service for pathogen replication and consequent apoptosis of infected macrophages in typhoid-like animal infection. These studies brought the focus on OMVs into \"membrane vesicle trafficking\" and showed this phenomenon as involved in multifarious processes like genetic transformation, quorum sensing, competition arsenal among microbes, etc., and invasion, infection, immuno-modulation, etc., of animal hosts. A mechanism has already been proposed for generation of OMVs by gram negative microbes involving, expansion of pockets of periplasm (named, \"periplasmic organelles\") due to accumulation of bacterial cell secretions and their pinching off as outer membrane bounded vesicles (OMVs) on the lines of a 'soap bubble' formation with a bubble tube, and further fusion or uptake of diffusing OMVs by host/target cells (Fig. 2).",

IL-10 shares similar immunomodulating mechanisms to TGF-\u03b2. It is thought that both cytokines reduce the rate of apoptosis in human alveolar macrophages, thus indirectly enhancing alveolar macrophage-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation. There is a significant increase in the basal rate of apoptosis upon activation by bacterial products. Apoptosis is particularly regulated by the presence of cytokines: IFN-\u03b3 increases the rate of apoptosis, whereas IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 decrease it. However, IL-10 has counterproductive effects on the immune system, and has been shown to actually promote infection by foreign pathogens. The role of IL-10 in bacterial and parasitic infection has been discovered as a strategy to evade host immune systems. There are bacteria which parasitize AMs by invading through their membranes, and thrive by growing and replicating inside of them, exploiting AMs as host cells. Normally, this infection can be eliminated by T-cells, which activate enzymes in alveolar macrophages that destroy the bacteria; but these bacteria have been shown to alter the cytokine signaling network to their advantage. As an inhibitory cytokine, IL-10 facilitates the infection of human alveolar macrophages and monocytes by completely reversing the protective effect of IFN-\u03b3 against intracellular Legionella pneumophila replication. Yersinia enterocolitica has also been shown to releases virulence antigen LcrV, which induces IL-10 through Toll-like receptor-2 and CD14 (an accessory surface protein of TLR4-mediated LPS-signaling), resulting in the suppression of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-alpha suppression.",

Recent studies employed an ex vivo human lymphoid aggregate culture (HLAC) system formed with fresh human tonsil or spleen tissue to model molecular and cellular events in human tissues during in vivo HIV infection.

Full viral replication was limited to the \u223c5% of activated CD4 T cells present in these tissues; these cells die by apoptosis. Abortive HIV infection occurs due to slowing of reverse transcription promoting cytosolic DNA accumulation. This viral DNA is sensed by gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), which produces an innate immune response against the virus by activating caspase 1 in IFI16 inflammasomes and inducing pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death. These findings cast CD4 T-cell death during HIV infection in a different light. Rather than the virus playing a major role, it is the host response to viral DNA produced during abortive infection that triggers CD4 T-cell death.

As cells die and toxic products of invasive organism replication accumulate, disease symptoms appear. Because this process involves specific proteins produced by the infectious organism as well as the host cell, even a very small change in a critical protein may render infection difficult or impossible. Such changes might arise by a process of mutation in the gene that codes for the protein. If the change is in the gamete, that is, the sperm or egg that join to form a zygote that grows into a human being, the protective mutation will be inherited.

The model highlights the co-evolution demonstrated by effector molecules of \"C. muridarum\" functioning to restrict accumulation of mouse IRGs on inclusions by modifying Irgb10, whereas the human pathogen is incapable of modifying the mouse IRG response.

Although the term pathogenesis-related proteins by itself may give the impression that (all) proteins common to pathological processes in a given plant species can be considered PRs, proteins that are constitutively present in low, yet readily detectable amounts, but which are increased substantially by pathogen infection, such as oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes or general enzymes of aromatic biosynthesis, have been excluded. However, if specific isoforms of such enzymes do not normally occur but are induced as a result of infection, such isoenzymes do belong to the PRs. The major criterion for inclusion among the PRs is that the protein concerned is newly expressed upon infection, although not necessarily in all pathological conditions. These considerations imply that the characteristics of the induction of PRs take priority over other identifying characteristics, such as chemical properties and cellular localization.18 Proteins that are induced exclusively during disease development in compatible host\u2013pathogen combinations have hardly been considered as PRs. Rather, the \u201cclassical\u201d PRs are a collective set of novel proteins associated with host defense mainly in incompatible interactions and, thus, are related primarily to a special type of pathogenesis, i.e., one culminating in the impediment of further pathogen progress. In compatible host\u2013pathogen interactions, pathogenesis, symptom expression, and reduction of growth are generally more severe, and enzyme activities may be increased to high levels, but novel host proteins have been observed only occasionally and remain poorly characterized. Proteins expressed under such conditions seem to be rather specific, being induced under the influence of particular pathogens but not others. This situation contrasts with the massive, apparently coordinated, induction of a common set of PRs in virtually any incompatible interaction, which in some cases can amount to 10% of the total soluble protein of the leaf. For this reason, PRs have been implicated in the resistance response and, more specifically, in the acquired resistance that is induced accompanying necrotic lesion formation in various plant species. When plants are locally infected with a pathogen inducing hypersensitive necrosis, they acquire systemically enhanced resistance to subsequent infection by various types of pathogens, and this systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is associated with the induction of PRs in tissues distant from the original inoculation site.1,7,8,19 Such observations suggested that PRs are defense proteins functioning in limiting pathogen multiplication and/or spread. Among the many metabolic alterations characteristic of a hypersensitive response, induction of PRs is a relatively late event,14 and their contribution to resistance against the initial infection is likely to be limited. In contrast, PRs induced in noninfected, distant leaves as a result of primary infection might afford an enhanced level of protection, resulting in reduced size or number of lesions, or even in reduced systemic symptom severity, upon further infection. The \u201crelated situations\u201d in which PRs were found to be induced, seem to prove the point: application of chemicals that mimic the effect of pathogen infection or induce some aspects of the host response, as well as wound responses that give rise to proteins that are also induced during infections, can induce both PRs and acquired resistance. This is the case for salicylic acid, for example, which has since been shown to be an essential intermediate in the signal\u2013transduction pathway leading to the induction of PRs in tobacco.",

To elaborate, LRP1 mainly contributes to regulation of protein activity by binding target proteins as a co-receptor, in conjunction with integral membrane proteins or adaptor proteins like uPA, to the lysosome for degradation. In lipoprotein metabolism, the interaction between LRP1 and APOE stimulates a signaling pathway that leads to elevated intracellular cAMP levels, increased protein kinase A activity, inhibited SMC migration, and ultimately, protection against vascular disease. While membrane-bound LRP1 performs endocytic clearance of proteases and inhibitors, proteolytic cleavage of its ectodomain allows the free LRP1 to compete with the membrane-bound form and prevent their clearance.

Cathepsin B inhibitor treatment of rats in which a seizure was induced resulted in improved neurological scores, learning ability and much reduced neuronal cell death and pro-apoptotic cell death peptides.

Gram negative microorganisms deploy their periplasm to secrete bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for trafficking bacterial biochemicals to target cells in their environment (Fig. 1); OMVs also carry endotoxic lipopolysaccharide initiating disease process in their host. This mechanism imparts a variety of benefits like, long-distance delivery of bacterial secretory cargo with minimized hydrolytic degradation and extra-cellular dilution, also supplemented with other supportive molecules (e.g., virulence factors) to accomplish a specific job and yet, keeping a safe-distance from the defense arsenal of the targeted cells. Biochemical signals trafficked by OMVs may vary largely during 'war and peace' situations. In 'complacent' bacterial colonies, OMVs may be used to carry DNA to 'related' microbes for genetic transformations, and also translocate cell signaling molecules for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. During 'challenge' from other cell types around, OMVs may be preferred to carry degradation and subversion enzymes. Likewise, OMVs may contain more of invasion proteins at the host-pathogen interface (Fig. 1). It is expected, that environmental factors around the secretory microbes are responsible for inducing these bacteria to synthesize and secrete specifically-enriched OMVs, physiologically suiting the immediate task. Thus, bacterial OMVs, being strong immunomodulators, can be manipulated for their immunogenic contents and utilized as potent pathogen-free vaccines for immunizing humans and animals against threatening infections.",

These plants have special receptors on their cell surfaces that allow for detection of pathogens and initiate mechanisms to inhibit pathogen growth. They contain two receptors, FLS2 (bacterial flagellin receptor) and EF-Tu (bacterial EF-Tu protein), which use signal transduction pathways to initiate the disease response pathway. The pathway leads to the recognition of the pathogen causing the infected cells to undergo cell death to stop the spread of the pathogen. Plants with FLS2 and EF-Tu receptors have shown to have increased fitness in the population. This has led to the belief that plant-pathogen resistance is an evolutionary mechanism that has built up over generations to respond to dynamic environments, such as increased predation and extreme temperatures.",

Delineating how CD4 T cells are depleted and how chronic inflammation and immune activation are induced lies at the heart of understanding HIV pathogenesis\u2013\u2013one of the top priorities for HIV research by the Office of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health. Recent studies demonstrated that caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, drives CD4 T-cell depletion and inflammation by HIV. These are the two signature events that propel HIV disease progression to AIDS. Pyroptosis appears to create a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells and other immune cells (including macrophages and neutrophils) release inflammatory signals that recruit more cells into the infected lymphoid tissues to die. The feed-forward nature of this inflammatory response produces chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Identifying pyroptosis as the predominant mechanism that causes CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation, provides novel therapeutic opportunities, namely caspase-1 which controls the pyroptotic pathway. In this regard, pyroptosis of CD4 T cells and secretion of pro-inflmammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 can be blocked in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, which has already proven to be safe and well tolerated in phase II human clinical trials. These findings could propel development of an entirely new class of \u201canti-AIDS\u201d therapies that act by targeting the host rather than the virus. Such agents would almost certainly be used in combination with ART. By promoting \u201ctolerance\u201d of the virus instead of suppressing its replication, VX-765 or related drugs may mimic the evolutionary solutions occurring in multiple monkey hosts (e.g. the sooty mangabey) infected with species-specific lentiviruses that have led to a lack of disease, no decline in CD4 T-cell counts, and no chronic inflammation.",

These viral inclusion bodies act as the centres of viral replication. The membrane glycoproteins NS3 and NS3a are expressed in large amounts in insect cells but not in mammalian cells. They are involved in the release of progeny virus particles from infected cells and may be involved in determination of both vector competence and virulence. Many orbiviruses preferentially infect vascular endothelial cells. Orbiviruses enter the host cell by endocytosis and the outer capsid is subsequently removed. The whole cycle of viral replication takes place within the cytoplasm of the host cell. Transcription of the viral genome into mRNA occurs within the core particle and mRNA is translated into proteins using the host cell ribosomes. Viral proteins are synthesized 2\u201314 days after initial infection. New virons self-assemble within the cytoplasm and are then released from the host cell by budding.

Antigenic variation refers to the mechanism by which an infectious agent such as a protozoan, bacterium or virus alters its surface proteins in order to evade a host immune response. It is related to phase variation. Immune evasion is particularly important for organisms that target long-lived hosts, repeatedly infect a single host and are easily transmittable. Antigenic variation not only enables immune evasion by the pathogen, but also allows the microbes to cause re-infection, as their antigens are no longer recognized by the host's immune system. When an organism is exposed to a particular antigen (i.e. a protein on the surface of a bacterium) an immune response is stimulated and antibodies are generated to target that specific antigen. The immune system will then \"remember\" that particular antigen, and defenses aimed at that antigen become part of the immune system\u2019s acquired immune response. If the same pathogen tries to re-infect the same host the antibodies will act rapidly to target the pathogen for destruction. However, if the pathogen can alter its surface antigens, it can evade the host's acquired immune system. This will allow the pathogen to re-infect the host while the immune system generates new antibodies to target the newly identified antigen. Antigenic variation can occur by altering a variety of surface molecules including proteins and carbohydrates. There are many molecular mechanisms behind antigenic variation, including gene conversion, site-specific DNA inversions, hypermutation, as well as recombination of sequence cassettes. In all cases, antigenic variation and phase variation result in a heterogenic phenotype of a clonal population. Individual cells either express the phase-variable protein(s) or express one of multiple antigenic forms of the protein. This form of regulation has been identified mainly, but not exclusively, for a wide variety of surface structures in pathogens and is implicated as a virulence strategy.",

This communication happens in microbial cultures to oceans, inside animal/plant hosts and wherever bacteria may thrive. Gram negative microorganisms deploy their periplasm to secrete bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for trafficking bacterial biochemicals to target cells in their environment (Fig. 1); OMVs also carry endotoxic lipopolysaccharide initiating disease process in their host. This mechanism imparts a variety of benefits like, long-distance delivery of bacterial secretory cargo with minimized hydrolytic degradation and extra-cellular dilution, also supplemented with other supportive molecules (e.g., virulence factors) to accomplish a specific job and yet, keeping a safe-distance from the defense arsenal of the targeted cells. Biochemical signals trafficked by OMVs may vary largely during 'war and peace' situations. In 'complacent' bacterial colonies, OMVs may be used to carry DNA to 'related' microbes for genetic transformations, and also translocate cell signaling molecules for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. During 'challenge' from other cell types around, OMVs may be preferred to carry degradation and subversion enzymes. Likewise, OMVs may contain more of invasion proteins at the host-pathogen interface (Fig. 1). It is expected, that environmental factors around the secretory microbes are responsible for inducing these bacteria to synthesize and secrete specifically-enriched OMVs, physiologically suiting the immediate task. Thus, bacterial OMVs, being strong immunomodulators, can be manipulated for their immunogenic contents and utilized as potent pathogen-free vaccines for immunizing humans and animals against threatening infections.",

Rheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the connective tissue around arterioles, and can occur after an untreated strep throat infection, specifically due to group A streptococcus (GAS), \"Streptococcus pyogenes\". It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity is a type II hypersensitivity reaction and is termed molecular mimicry. Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. During a streptococcal infection, mature antigen-presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4+T cells which differentiate into helper T cells. Helper T cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints, producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever. \"S. pyogenes\" is a species of aerobic, cocci, gram-positive bacteria that are non-motile, non-spore forming, and forms chains and large colonies.",

Unlike in eukaryotes, membrane vesicular trafficking in prokaryotes is an emerging area in interactive biology for intra-species (quorum sensing) and inter-species signaling at host-pathogen interface, as prokaryotes lack internal membrane-compartmentalization of their cytoplasm. For more than four decades, cultures of gram negative microbes revealed the presence of nanoscale membrane vesicles. A role for membrane vesicles in pathogenic processes has been suspected since the 1970s, when they were observed in gingival plaque by electron microscopy. These vesicles were suspected to promote bacterial adhesion to the host epithelial cell surface. Their role in invasion of animal host cells \"in vivo\" was then demonstrated. In inter-bacterial interactions, OMVs released by \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" microbes were shown to fuse with outer membrane of other gram negative microbes causing their bacteriolysis; these OMVs could lyse gram-positive microbes as well. Role of OMVs in \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection of \"human\" primary antral epithelial cells, as model that closely resembles human stomach, has also been confirmed VacA-containing OMVs could also be detected in human gastric mucosa, infected with \"H. pylori.\". \"Salmonella\" OMVs were also shown to have direct role in invasion of chicken ileal epithelial cells \"in vivo\" in the year, 1993 (ref 4) and later, in hijacking of defense macrophages into sub-service for pathogen replication and consequent apoptosis of infected macrophages in typhoid-like animal infection. These studies brought the focus on OMVs into \"membrane vesicle trafficking\" and showed this phenomenon as involved in multifarious processes like genetic transformation, quorum sensing, competition arsenal among microbes, etc., and invasion, infection, immuno-modulation, etc., of animal hosts. A mechanism has already been proposed for generation of OMVs by gram negative microbes involving, expansion of pockets of periplasm (named, \"periplasmic organelles\") due to accumulation of bacterial cell secretions and their pinching off as outer membrane bounded vesicles (OMVs) on the lines of a 'soap bubble' formation with a bubble tube, and further fusion or uptake of diffusing OMVs by host/target cells (Fig. 2).",

This prevents the development of constant inflammation and forms tolerance against harmless microbiota.  This process becomes much more intriguing when taking into account that commensals often share their surface molecules with pathogens.

Symptoms of bacterial panicle blight include seedling blighting and sheath rot in addition to panicle blighting, which accounts for most of the damage from this disease. Affected panicles have blighted florets, which initially show white or light gray on the basal third with a dark-brown margin and eventually become straw-colored. The florets then turn dark with growth of fungi or bacteria on the surface. Extensive occurrence of upright panicles because of the failure of grain-filling and seed development is a typical phenomenon observed in a severely infested field. Prolonged high temperature during the growing season is an important environmental condition that promotes the development of bacterial panicle blight.  Severe epidemics of this disease, which caused up to 40 percent yield losses in some fields, occurred during the 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000 and, most recently, 2010 growing seasons, when record-high night temperatures were experienced. Suspected global warming could make bacterial panicle blight a greater threat to rice production in the future. Indeed, occurrence of bacterial panicle blight is increasing not only in the southern United States but in other rice growing countries of Central and South America and Asia. <br>The disease cycle of bacterial panicle blight is not fully understood in spite of the economic importance of the disease. <br>The bacterial pathogens are considered to be seed-borne, but they also survive in the soil. After germination of the seed, the bacteria appear to survive on the leaves and sheath and spread upward as the plant grows. Their infection to rice panicles occurs at flowering, if the bacterial population reaches to a threshold level and environmental condition is favorable. They may also be disseminated from severely diseased panicles to neighboring healthy plants, according to the observed spatial distribution patterns of the disease in infested rice fields. However, it is not clear if long-distance dissemination can occur via insect transmission. Unfortunately, there are few effective control measures for this disease so far. Less nitrogen fertilization reduces disease severity but has not been successful. High temperatures at the vulnerable period can be avoided by early planting, but this cultural practice would become useless if hot weather comes early in the growing season. No pesticides are currently recommended or allowed for controlling this disease in the United States. Copper compounds are weakly effective but sometimes toxic to the plant. Oxolinic acid is useful for seed treatment, and its foliar spray is effective on infected plants, but this chemical is not commercially available in the United States. <br>The research goal on bacterial panicle blight is to develop effective disease control methods based on better understanding of the bacterial virulence mechanism and the rice defense system. To achieve this goal, LSU AgCenter scientists are conducting several different areas of research. First, scientists are making efforts to develop new rice varieties and lines resistant to bacterial panicle blight through conventional breeding and line development processes. More than 15,000 lines are evaluated annually to select promising lines showing high levels of disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight and other good agronomic traits. The partial-resistant rice varieties and lines, such as Jupiter and LM-1, were developed from this program. Second, scientists are conducting genetic and molecular biological studies on the rice disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight. Genetic mapping to identify the rice genes associated with the disease resistance is under way. In addition, the induction of a rice defense system by pretreatment of various chemical materials, which leads to enhanced disease resistance, is being studied.

When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. \"Agrobacterium\" performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA into the plant's genome. See above for more details about the process of plasmid DNA insertion into the host genome. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes this tissue to become crushed and/or distorted. The crushed vessels lead to reduced water flow in the xylem. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant. Crown gall disease caused by \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" can be controlled by using various different methods. The best way to control this disease is to take preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools so as to avoid infecting new plants. Performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields are also valuable practices. Avoiding wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation is important for preventing disease. In horticultural techniques in which multiple plants are joined together to grow as one, such as budding and grafting these techniques lead to plant wounds. Wounds are the primary location of bacterial entry into the host plant. Therefore, it is advisable to perform these techniques during times of the year when \"Agrobacteria\" are not active. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection, since these insects cause wounds (aka bacterial entryways) in the plant roots. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.",

The mice that had a latent infection of the virus had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria.
