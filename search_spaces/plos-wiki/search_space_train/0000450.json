Functional Molecular Infection Epidemiology (FMIE) is an emerging area of medicine that entails the study of pathogen genes and genomes in the context of their functional association with the host niches (adhesion, invasion, adaptation) and the complex interactions they trigger within the host immune system (cell signaling, apoptosis) to culminate in varied outcomes of the infection. This can also be defined as the correlation of genetic variations in a pathogen or its respective host with a unique function that is important for disease severity, disease progression, or host susceptibility to a particular pathogen. Functional epidemiology implies not only descriptive host-pathogen genomic associations, but rather the interplay between pathogen and host genomic variations to functionally demonstrate the role of the genetic variations during infection.",

The systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a \"whole-plant\" resistance response that occurs following an earlier localized exposure to a pathogen. SAR is analogous to the innate immune system found in animals, and there is evidence that SAR in plants and innate immunity in animals may be evolutionarily conserved. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in \"Arabidopsis\" (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. SAR is important for plants to resist disease, as well as to recover from disease once formed. SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called \"broad spectrum\". SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or \"pathogenesis-related\" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA). The pathogen-induced SA signal activates a molecular signal transduction pathway that is identified by a gene called \"NIM1\", \"NPR1\" or \"SAI1\" (three names for the same gene) in the model genetic system \"Arabidopsis thaliana\". SAR has been observed in a wide range of flowering plants, including dicotyledon and monocotyledon species.

Free Ca levels in the cytoplasm increases in response to a pathogenic infection. Ca signatures of this nature usually activate the plant defense system by inducing defense-related genes and the hypersensitive cell death. CaMs, CMLs and CaM-binding proteins are some of the recently identified elements of the plant defense signaling pathways. Several CML genes in tobacco, bean and tomato are responsive to pathogens. CML43 is a CaM-related protein that, as isolated from APR134 gene in the disease-resistant leaves of \"Arabidopsis\" for gene expression analysis, is rapidly induced when the leaves are inoculated with \"Pseudomonas syringae.\" These genes are also found in tomatoes (\"Solanum lycopersicum).\" The CML43 from the APR134 also binds to Ca ions in vitro which shows that CML43 and APR134 are, hence, involved in the Ca-dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens. The CML9 expression in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is rapidly induced by phytopathogenic bacteria, flagellin and salicylic acid. Expression of soybean SCaM4 and SCaM5 in transgenic \"tobacco\" and \"Arabidopsis\" causes an activation of genes related to pathogen resistance and also results in enhanced resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogen infection. The same is not true for soybean SCaM1 and SCaM2 that are highly conserved CaM isoforms. The \"At\"BAG6 protein is a CaM-binding protein that binds to CaM only in the absence of Ca and not in the presence of it. \"At\"BAG6 is responsible for the hypersensitive response of programmed cell death in order to prevent the spread of pathogen infection or to restrict pathogen growth. Mutations in the CaM binding proteins can lead to severe effects on the defense response of the plants towards pathogen infections. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are functional protein channels in the plasma membrane that have overlapping CaM binding sites transport divalent cations such as Ca. However, the exact role of the positioning of the CNGCs in this pathway for plant defense is still unclear.",

When \"Botrytis cinerea\" or \"Alternaria brassicicola\" or any other necrotrophic pathogen is present, BIK1 is transcribed to regulate the pathogen response mechanisms. When BIK1 is present, SA levels decrease, allowing the nectrotrophic response to take place.

In terms of non-pathogenic cellular functions, BIK1 is described as a critical component of ET signaling and PAMP-triggered immunity to pathogens. For cellular processes that are not directly related to pathogen resistance or defense, BIK1 does not utilize traditional defense-mediating hormones such as SA, JA, or ACC, but instead utilizes an herbicide, known as paraquat which produces ROIs. It is believed that SA, JA, and ACC have no effect on BIK1 induction because they are likely located downstream from the BIK1 gene, or it is possible that BIK1 operates completely independently. However, it is believed that BIK1 does play a vital role in the ET signaling pathway.

It is often noted that \"Hypoxylon\" canker does not kill a tree--it merely capitalizes on trees that are already dying due to stress or other means, and may be a significant contributing factor to tree death (3). It is important to note that the \"Hypoxylon\" can remain dormant in healthy trees for many years before becoming pathogenic due to plant stress from temperature, water loss, physical and chemical diseases, and other plant pathogens (5).",

Bacteria communicate among themselves and with other living forms in their environment via nano-scale membrane vesicles in their bacterial outer membranes. These vesicles are involved in trafficking bacterial cell signaling biochemicals, which may include DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins and allied virulence molecules. This communication happens in microbial cultures to oceans, inside animal/plant hosts and wherever bacteria may thrive. Gram negative microorganisms deploy their periplasm to secrete bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for trafficking bacterial biochemicals to target cells in their environment (Fig. 1); OMVs also carry endotoxic lipopolysaccharide initiating disease process in their host. This mechanism imparts a variety of benefits like, long-distance delivery of bacterial secretory cargo with minimized hydrolytic degradation and extra-cellular dilution, also supplemented with other supportive molecules (e.g., virulence factors) to accomplish a specific job and yet, keeping a safe-distance from the defense arsenal of the targeted cells. Biochemical signals trafficked by OMVs may vary largely during 'war and peace' situations. In 'complacent' bacterial colonies, OMVs may be used to carry DNA to 'related' microbes for genetic transformations, and also translocate cell signaling molecules for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. During 'challenge' from other cell types around, OMVs may be preferred to carry degradation and subversion enzymes. Likewise, OMVs may contain more of invasion proteins at the host-pathogen interface (Fig. 1). It is expected, that environmental factors around the secretory microbes are responsible for inducing these bacteria to synthesize and secrete specifically-enriched OMVs, physiologically suiting the immediate task. Thus, bacterial OMVs, being strong immunomodulators, can be manipulated for their immunogenic contents and utilized as potent pathogen-free vaccines for immunizing humans and animals against threatening infections.",

When \"Botrytis cinerea\" is present, the BIK1 gene is transcribed so that the kinase is present to defend the cell. BIK1 functions to regulate the amount of salicylic acid (SA) present in the cell. When \"Botrytis cinerea\" or \"Alternaria brassicicola\" or any other necrotrophic pathogen is present, BIK1 is transcribed to regulate the pathogen response mechanisms. When BIK1 is present, SA levels decrease, allowing the nectrotrophic response to take place. When nectrotrophic pathogens are not present, BIK1 is not transcribed and SA levels increase, limiting the necrotrophic resistance pathway. Only the pathogenic defense response that is initiated by BIK1 is dependent on SA levels. Non-pathogenic cellular functions occur independently. In terms of non-pathogenic cellular functions, BIK1 is described as a critical component of ET signaling and PAMP-triggered immunity to pathogens. For cellular processes that are not directly related to pathogen resistance or defense, BIK1 does not utilize traditional defense-mediating hormones such as SA, JA, or ACC, but instead utilizes an herbicide, known as paraquat which produces ROIs. It is believed that SA, JA, and ACC have no effect on BIK1 induction because they are likely located downstream from the BIK1 gene, or it is possible that BIK1 operates completely independently. However, it is believed that BIK1 does play a vital role in the ET signaling pathway.

Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in \"Arabidopsis\" (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. SAR is important for plants to resist disease, as well as to recover from disease once formed. SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called \"broad spectrum\". SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or \"pathogenesis-related\" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA).

The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth.

CaMs, CMLs and CaM-binding proteins are some of the recently identified elements of the plant defense signaling pathways. Several CML genes in tobacco, bean and tomato are responsive to pathogens. CML43 is a CaM-related protein that, as isolated from APR134 gene in the disease-resistant leaves of \"Arabidopsis\" for gene expression analysis, is rapidly induced when the leaves are inoculated with \"Pseudomonas syringae.\" These genes are also found in tomatoes (\"Solanum lycopersicum).\" The CML43 from the APR134 also binds to Ca ions in vitro which shows that CML43 and APR134 are, hence, involved in the Ca-dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens. The CML9 expression in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is rapidly induced by phytopathogenic bacteria, flagellin and salicylic acid. Expression of soybean SCaM4 and SCaM5 in transgenic \"tobacco\" and \"Arabidopsis\" causes an activation of genes related to pathogen resistance and also results in enhanced resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogen infection.

Plants have many protection mechanisms to cope with stresses from the environment, which include ultraviolet light, cold or hot weather, windy days, and mechanical wounding. There are multiple pathways, but one pathway that plants have been able to develop is a self-defense mechanism by recognize pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via cell surface-located pathogen-recognition receptors. These receptors induce intracellular signal pathways within the plant cells, while also resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity. Responses to PAMPs target broadly instead of specifically. This immunity requires downstream components via the MAPK cascade to activate the MAP kinases. The flagellin, a peptide of flg22, triggers a rapid and strong activation of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6. MPK4 and MPK6 can be activated by harpin proteins. MPK3 and MPK6 are very similar proteins and have a function as regulators in abscission, stomatal development, signaling various abiotic stresses, and defense responses to certain pathogens. Experimentation has proposed that the MAPK module MEKK1-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 may be responsible for flg22 signal transmission. All of the proposed modules appear to be correct expect for MEKK1 because plants with \"mekk1\" mutated have a compromised flg22-triggered activation of MPK4, yet they have normal activation of MPK3 and MPK6. Data has shown that MAPK cascade is composed of MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6 in response to fungal pathogens. The observation shows that the activation of MPK3/MPK6 in conditional gain-of-function plants for MKK4/MKK5 or MEKK1/MKKKa is sufficient to induce camalexin, which is a major phytoalexin in \"Arabidopsis.\" The stomata are considered to be the entry point for pathogenic invaders because microbial invaders enter the plant at the stomata. A recent study has shown that MAPK cascades play a role in abiotic and biotic stress responses. The main pathways in stomatal development and dynamics are MPK3 and MPK6. During a drought, the stomata closes and is believed to be mediated by the phytohormone, abscisic acid, and involves MKK1, MPK3, and MPK6. Another way of closing the stomata is through a closing process that is called pathogen-induced, which is an innate response from the plant. \"Campestris (Xcc)\" excretes a chemical that reverts stomatal closure that was caused by bacteria and abscisic acid (ABA). Most stomata close in the presents of ABA, but some are unresponsive to bacteria. In \"Arabidopsis\" \"Xcc\" does not revert bacteria-induced or ABA-induced stomatal closure.

            "document": "Innate immune system . Most plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals sent throughout a plant. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in Arabidopsis (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. When a part of a plant becomes infected with a microbial or viral pathogen, in case of an incompatible interaction triggered by specific elicitors, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response (HR), in which cells at the site of infection undergo rapid programmed cell death to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant. HR has some similarities to animal pyroptosis, such as a requirement of caspase-1-like proteolytic activity of VPE\u03b3, a cysteine protease that regulates cell disassembly during cell death.",

During Ustilago scitaminea infection, the fungus grows within the meristematic tissue and induces formation of flowering structures, which it colonises to produce its teliopores. The flowering structures, usually typical grass panicles, are transformed into a whip-like sorus that grows rapidly and protrudes out between the leaf sheaths. The development of sugarcane smut depends on the interaction among environment, the sugarcane variety and the pathogen itself. If the interaction between smut-resistant varieties and the pathogen is nonaffinity, disease resistance occurs; however, if the interaction between smut-susceptible varieties and the pathogen is affinity, disease susceptibility occurs. A series of physiological and biochemical changes, together with the molecular response, occur during the period between the appearance of the stress on plant from the invasion of the pathogen and the subsequent plant-pathogen interaction. Progress has been made in studies of the molecular basis of sugarcane smut resistance. According to one study, the type of resistance is a single gene resistance at the N52/219 gene site. Furthermore this study talked about several different strains or races of Ustilago scitaminea. Despite what has been learned, more studies on the molecular interaction in this pathosystem are needed to discover the mechanisms of smut resistance.",

Many R genes encode NB-LRR proteins (proteins with nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domains, also known as NLR proteins or STAND proteins, among other names). Most plant immune systems carry a repertoire of 100-600 different R gene homologs. Individual R genes have been demonstrated to mediate resistance to specific virus, bacteria, oomycete, fungus, nematode or insect strains.

This means that using insecticides has no effect on the susceptibility of a tomato plants susceptibility to this pathogen. However, there are several cultural practices that can be done to suppress this fungal pathogen's impact. The disease first occurs in the host's exposed leaves. Plants planted with rows in an east-west direction have more severe disease than do plants planted north-south. This implies that if one plants tomato plants in a north-south manner they will be less susceptible. It is also suggested to highly monitor plants in April through June. This is when the pathogen is most prevalent. If monitoring indicates the presence of AAL, it is suggested to begin late-spring treatments of fungicide about mid-April. However, if a garden has a history of disease, it is advised to take extra measures. This can be done by treating tomatoes in mid to late April and 2 to 3 weeks later by applying a fungicide. Because this is a fungal pathogen that thrives off of wet environments, overhead irrigation is never advised when irrigating. This causes the moisture to remain on the leaf tissue and increase susceptibility to the disease and an optimal environment for the fungus to survive and grow. A better solution to this problem is using a drip irrigation system; this allows the majority of the plant to stay dry.",

Potential host plants that are stressed are more susceptible to infection. Factors that may cause stress in plants and therefore increase the likelihood of infection include high saline conditions, drought, nutrient deficiencies, and excessive moisture around the plant. High saline content in the soil can promote infection at lower temperature and humidity that is ideal for the pathogen. Excessive nitrogen fertilization will also increase the chance of infection because the nitrogen decreases the function of the plant\u2019s innate defense response, and it also damages the ends of the roots, which are the primary mode of infection. Furthermore, the medium in which plants are grown dictates affects the severity of Pythium infection. Sterile soil-less cultures are the most susceptible, while increasing soil content inhibits disease progression due to bacteria present in the soil.

These plants have special receptors on their cell surfaces that allow for detection of pathogens and initiate mechanisms to inhibit pathogen growth.

The pathway leads to the recognition of the pathogen causing the infected cells to undergo cell death to stop the spread of the pathogen.

However, increasing potassium concentration above the optimal level does not provide greater disease resistance. In agriculture, some cultivars are more efficient at K uptake due to genetic variations, and often these plants have increased disease resistance. The mechanisms involved with increased host resistance and potassium include a decreased cell permeability and decreased susceptibility to tissue penetration.
