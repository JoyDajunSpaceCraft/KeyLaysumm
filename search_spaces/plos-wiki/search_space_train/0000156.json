The composition of RNA in plant EVs has not been fully evaluated, but it is likely that they are, in part, responsible for trafficking RNA. Plants can transport viral RNAs, mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) systemically through the phloem. This process is thought to occur through the plasmodesmata and involves RNA-binding proteins that assist RNA localization in mesophyll cells. Although they have been identified in the phloem with mRNA, there is no determinate evidence that they mediate long-distant transport of RNAs. EVs may therefore contribute to an alternate pathway of RNA loading into the phloem, or could possibly transport RNA through the apoplast. There is also evidence that plant EVs can allow for interspecies transfer of sRNAs by RNA interference such as Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS). The transport of RNA between plants and fungi seems to be bidirectional as sRNAs from the fungal pathogen \"Botrytis cinerea\" have been shown to target host defense genes in Arabidopsis and tomato.",

Combining ultracentrifugation with micro-filtration or a gradient can improve purity. Single step isolation of extracellular vesicles by size-exclusion chromatography has been demonstrated to provide greater efficiency for recovering intact vesicles over centrifugation, although a size-based technique alone will not be able to distinguish exosomes from other vesicle types. To isolate a pure population of exosomes a combination of techniques is necessary, based on both physical (e.g. size, density) and biochemical parameters (e.g. presence/absence of certain proteins involved in their biogenesis).",

Wide-bandgap devices therefore are useful at shorter wavelengths than other semiconductor devices. The bandgap for GaAs of 1.4 eV, for example, corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 890\u00a0nm, which is invisible infrared light (the equivalent wavelength for light energy can be determined by dividing the constant 1240\u00a0nm-eV by the energy in eV, so 1240\u00a0nm-eV/1.4 eV=886\u00a0nm). Therefore, GaAs photovoltaics are not ideal for converting shorter-wavelength visible light into electricity. Silicon at 1.1 eV (1100\u00a0nm) is even worse. For solar-energy conversion using a single junction photovoltaic cell, the ideal bandgap has been variously estimated from around 1.0 eV up to around 1.5 eV (depending on various assumptions) because that low wavelength threshold covers nearly the entire solar spectrum that reaches the Earth's surface, but a lower-bandgap single-junction cell wastes a large portion of that power by inefficiently converting the shorter-wavelength parts of the solar spectrum. Because of this, a major area in solar energy research is developing multi-junction solar cells that collect separate parts of the spectrum with more efficiency, and wide bandgap photovoltaics are a key component for collecting the part of the spectrum beyond the infrared.",

Common lamp photon energies include 10.0 eV, 10.6 eV and 11.7 eV; the standard 10.6 eV lamp lasts for years, while the 11.7 eV lamp typically last only a few months and is used only when no other option is available.

EVs may therefore contribute to an alternate pathway of RNA loading into the phloem, or could possibly transport RNA through the apoplast. There is also evidence that plant EVs can allow for interspecies transfer of sRNAs by RNA interference such as Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS).

Conductive CNT coatings have recently become a prospective substitute based on wide range of methods including spraying, spin coating, casting, layer-by-layer, and Langmuir\u2013Blodgett deposition. The transfer from a filter membrane to the transparent support using a solvent or in the form of an adhesive film is another method for attaining flexible and optically transparent CNT films. Other research efforts have shown that films made of arc-discharge CNT can result in a high conductivity and transparency. Furthermore, the work function of SWCNT networks is in the 4.8 to 4.9 eV range (compared to ITO which has a lower work function of 4.7 eV) leading to the expectation that the SWCNT work function should be high enough to assure efficient hole collection. Another benefit is that SWCNT films exhibit a high optical transparency in a broad spectral range from the UV-visible to the near-infrared range. Only a few materials retain reasonable transparency in the infrared spectrum while maintaining transparency in the visible part of the spectrum as well as acceptable overall electrical conductivity. SWCNT films are highly flexible, do not creep, do not crack after bending, theoretically have high thermal conductivities to tolerate heat dissipation, and have high radiation resistance. However, the electrical sheet resistance of ITO is an order of magnitude less than the sheet resistance measured for SWCNT films. Nonetheless, initial research studies demonstrate SWCNT thin films can be used as conducting, transparent electrodes for hole collection in OPV devices with efficiencies between 1% and 2.5% confirming that they are comparable to devices fabricated using ITO. Thus, possibilities exist for advancing this research to develop CNT-based transparent electrodes that exceed the performance of traditional ITO materials.",

IMAC enrichment is based on phosphate affinity for immobilized metal chelated to the resin. SCX separates phosphorylated from non-phosphorylated peptides based on the negatively charged phosphate group. Titanium dioxide chromatography is a newer technique that requires significantly less column preparation time. Many phosphoproteomic studies use a combination of these enrichment strategies to obtain the purest sample possible.",

Scanning tunneling microscopy shows the presence of local regions where oxygen atoms are arranged in a rectangular pattern with lattice constant 0.27\u00a0nm \u00d7 0.41\u00a0nm The edges of each layer are terminated with carboxyl and carbonyl groups. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows presence of several C peaks, their number and relative intensity depending on particular oxidation method used. Assignment of these peaks to certain carbon functionalization types is somewhat uncertain and still under debates. For example, one of interpretations goes as following: non-oxygenated ring contexts (284.8 eV), C-O (286.2 eV), C=O (287.8 eV) and O-C=O (289.0 eV). Another interpretation using density functional theory calculation goes as following: C=C with defects such as functional groups and pentagons (283.6 eV), C=C (non-oxygenated ring contexts) (284.3 eV), spC-H in the basal plane and C=C with functional groups (285.0 eV), C=O and C=C with functional groups, C-O (286.5 eV), and O-C=O (288.3 eV).",

EVs have a higher energy efficiency than traditional petrol vehicles, allowing an 80% conversion of input energy into usable power, as a 15%-20% improvement than the latter. With technological advancements, EVs have higher battery capacity that allows 100\u00a0km travelling distance after a single charge, far higher than the original 40\u00a0km at the early development. By comparing EVs with petrol vehicles over the energy cost, the price of the latter is around 13.6 times higher in the case from Tuen Mun to Mong Kok (30\u00a0km; HKD4.7:HKD36.7). The 2011-12 Financial Budget highlighted the value brought by the green development has increased by 12.4% with the 3.6% surge of employees. With the recent emphasis on green economy and smart city in the 2015-16 Financial Budget, the Government believes that the high cost- effectiveness of EVs allows further creation of business and employment opportunities like the complementary accessories of EVs and R&D for further scientific innovations in the ever-expanding market.",

            "document": "Eve Russell . In an interview with The Atlas Society, Ross related that her approach to Eve was inspired by Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy. She said that Eve was \"always willing to make sacrifices, and there's always somebody willing, as Ayn Rand said, to take any sacrifices you might be willing to make.\" She compared Eve to Catherine Halsey in Rand's 1943 novel, \"The Fountainhead\", particularly around the middle of the novel, before Catherine \"was completely destroyed\". Ross described Eve as \"a self-sacrificing animal\", and emphasized that her character was distinct from her own self-identification as an individualist. Ross said that her portrayal of Eve was also influenced by Eve White, a character with dissociative identity disorder played by Joanne Woodward in the 1957 film \"The Three Faces of Eve\". The actress researched books on sociopaths and psychopaths to help her approach Eve's desire to hide her past at any cost. During the filming process, she kept a diary to help her better understand how to approach future scenes. Ross also used the 2001 novel \"Hidden Passions: Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox\" to inform her interpretation of Eve's past. She expressed surprise that Eve's relationship with Julian was \"a real short courtship\" that turned the character from \"the innocent girl to the woman on the Studio 54 dance floor having sex\". After adjusting her perception of Eve's past, Ross chose to play the character's descent into drugs and prostitution as \"more immediate, wild[,] and impulsive\" and \"very untamed and unrestrained\".",

In order to purify toxin B from \"C. difficile\" cell cultures, brain heart infusion broth is used because it promotes the synthesis of toxin B. The filtration method facilitates purification of toxin B from the supernatant of \"C. difficile\". The toxin concentration of the supernatant is proportional to the organism cell count. It has been proposed by many studies that the majority of the toxins are released in either late log phase or early stationary phases, hence, toxin B is continuously secreted by cells. Although there are many methods employed by different studies in purifying toxin B, the majority of studies use methods involving concentrations of ultrafiltrated ammonium sulfate or precipitation, in lieu by either gel filtration or ion-exchange chromatography. In addition, the effectiveness of the ion-exchange chromatography method helps to differentiate between TcdA and TcdB.",
