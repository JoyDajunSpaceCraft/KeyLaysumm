A later proposal was that the GGUG motif is recognised by the zinc finger domain and not the RRM (80). Additionally, FUS/TLS has been found to bind a relatively long region in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the actin-stabilising protein Nd1-L mRNA, suggesting that rather than recognising specific short sequences, FUS/TLS interacts with multiple RNA-binding motifs or recognises secondary conformations.

Transcription of Pol V via the umuDC genes is highly regulated to produce only Pol V when damaged DNA is present in the cell generating an SOS response. Stalled polymerases causes RecA to bind to the ssDNA, which causes the LexA protein to autodigest. LexA then loses its ability to repress the transcription of the umuDC operon. The same RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein posttranslationally modifies the UmuD protein into UmuD' protein. UmuD and UmuD' form a heterodimer that interacts with UmuC, which in turn activates umuC's polymerase catalytic activity on damaged DNA. In E. coli, a polymerase \u201ctool belt\u201d model for switching pol III with pol IV at a stalled replication fork, where both polymerases bind simultaneously to the \u03b2-clamp, has been proposed.

As noted above, a Pol\u03b4 heterotrimer (Pol\u03b43) becomes the dominant oligomeric form of POLD1 and is active during the presence of DNA damage. Pol\u03b43 is less error-prone than (Pol\u03b44), and can discriminate better between mismatched pairs, associated with better proofreading activity: however, it has reduced ability to bypass some base lesions. Instead, Pol\u03b4 polymerase switching to the specialized polymerase zeta (Pol\u03b6) is important for TLS as the substitution of p125 for the Pol\u03b6 catalytic subunit, p353, permits better bypass activity. In this process, the highly conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) of POLD1/p125 interacts with the CTD domain of Pol\u03b6, and the iron clusters within each CTD mediate interactions involving binding to POLD2 that permit polymerase switching during TLS.

Case described the detector material as consisting of thallium, oxygen and sulfur, and this was incorrectly described by others as being thallium oxysulfide, which incidentally is a compound that is not known.

TlS has a distorted anti-CdI structure. TlS can be prepared from the elements or by precipitating the sulfide from a solution of thallium(I), e.g. the sulfate or nitrate. Thin films have been deposited, produced from a mixture of citratothallium complex and thiourea. Heating the film in nitrogen at 300\u00b0C converts all the product into TlS",

While the CRIME attack was presented as a general attack that could work effectively against a large number of protocols, including but not limited to TLS, and application-layer protocols such as SPDY or HTTP, only exploits against TLS and SPDY were demonstrated and largely mitigated in browsers and servers. The CRIME exploit against HTTP compression has not been mitigated at all, even though the authors of CRIME have warned that this vulnerability might be even more widespread than SPDY and TLS compression combined. In 2013 a new instance of the CRIME attack against HTTP compression, dubbed BREACH, was announced. Based on the CRIME attack a BREACH attack can extract login tokens, email addresses or other sensitive information from TLS encrypted web traffic in as little as 30 seconds (depending on the number of bytes to be extracted), provided the attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious web link or is able to inject content into valid pages the user is visiting (ex: a wireless network under the control of the attacker). All versions of TLS and SSL are at risk from BREACH regardless of the encryption algorithm or cipher used. Unlike previous instances of CRIME, which can be successfully defended against by turning off TLS compression or SPDY header compression, BREACH exploits HTTP compression which cannot realistically be turned off, as virtually all web servers rely upon it to improve data transmission speeds for users. This is a known limitation of TLS as it is susceptible to chosen-plaintext attack against the application-layer data it was meant to protect.",

Each phenotypic response is quantified by imaging colony size to determine growth rate. This fitness score is compared to the predicted fitness for each single mutant, resulting in a genetic interaction score. Hierarchical clustering of this data to group genes with similar interaction profiles allows for the identification of epistatic relationships between genes with and without known function. By sorting the data in this way, genes known to interact will cluster together alongside genes which exhibit a similar pattern of interactions but whose function has not yet been identified. The E-MAP data is therefore able to place genes into new functions within well characterized pathways.

Thus, E-MAP studies rely upon strains with intermediate expression levels of these genes. The decreased abundance by messenger RNA perturbation (DAmP) strategy is particularly common for the high-throughput generation of mutants necessary for this kind of analysis and allows for the partial disruption of essential genes without loss of viability.

            "document": "DNA repair . Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a DNA damage tolerance process that allows the DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching is thought to be mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol \u03b7 mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol \u03b9 introduces mutations at these sites. Pol \u03b7 is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, G[8,5-Me]T, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in \"Escherichia coli\" by replicating a G[8,5-Me]T-modified plasmid in \"E. coli\" with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases. A bypass platform is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At a site of lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension can be carried out by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, as in the case of Pol \u03b7, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol \u03b6. Pol \u03b6 is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol \u03b9 to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol \u03b6 to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.",

This makes Pol \u03b6 very important in translesion synthesis (TLS), because it can act in concert with other TLS polymerases that can add across the lesion to complete the bypass of the lesion. Most polymerases have difficulty extending mismatches because they cannot bind properly to the mismatched DNA. So rather than the cell dying, it can survive albeit with a mutation that may or may not be deleterious, so it is believed that Pol \u03b6 is a driving force of evolution.",

In the structure of TlBaCuO (Tl-2201), there is one CuO layer with the stacking sequence (Tl\u2013O) (Tl\u2013O) (Ba\u2013O) (Cu\u2013O) (Ba\u2013O) (Tl\u2013O) (Tl\u2013O). In TlBaCaCuO (Tl-2212), there are two Cu\u2013O layers with a Ca layer in between. Similar to the TlBaCuO structure, Tl\u2013O layers are present outside the Ba\u2013O layers. In TlBaCaCuO (Tl-2223), there are three CuO layers enclosing Ca layers between each of these. In Tl-based superconductors, \"T\" is found to increase with the increase in CuO layers. However, the value of \"T\" decreases after four CuO layers in TlBaCaCuO, and in the TlBaCaCuO compound, it decreases after three CuO layers.",

            "document": "Cycle (gene) . The identification, characterization, and cloning of \"cyc\" was reported in May 1998 in \"Cell\" by Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash\u2019s labs at Brandeis University along with first author Joan E. Rutila at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Prior to its discovery, the mechanism by which PER and TIM transcription was regulated rhythmically was not fully understood. They published the papers reporting the discovery of CYCLE and CLOCK in the same issue of Cell. They found both genes as a result of a technique of forward genetics, chemically mutagenzing flies and screening for altered locomotor activity rhythms. From the screen, \"cycle\" was identified as a recessive arrhythmic mutant in one fly line because it shows arrhythmic locomotor activity patterns when a fly has 2 mutant chromosomes number 3. These mutant flies were also found to display arrhythmic eclosion. Because the mutants displayed no circadian rhythms and the heterozygote flies displayed long circadian periods, they determined that \"cycle\" has a dominant phenotype. These data also suggest that the \"Cycle\" gene is part of the biological clock because of the similarity between the \"cycle\" mutant phenotype and that of the \"clock\" mutant. This suggests that Cycle is part of the biological clock with its phenotype similar to that of the \"clock\" mutant. Assaying PER and TIM transcription levels in the \"cyc\" mutant showed reduced mRNA levels of both proteins. Cloning of the \"cyc\" gene revealed that it encodes a novel bHLH-PAS protein related to mammalian bmal1, and that it likely binds to Clock to activate transcription of circadian rhythm genes.",

Several studies involving this isolated enzyme indicated that DNA pol I was most likely involved in repair replication and was not the main replicative polymerase. In order to better understand the \"in vivo\" role of DNA pol I, \"E. coli\" mutants deficient in this enzyme (termed Pol A1) were generated in 1969 by De Lucia and Cairns. As characterized, this new mutant strain was more sensitive to ultraviolet light, corroborating the hypothesis that DNA pol II was involved in repair replication. The mutant grew at the same rate as the wild type, indicating the presence of another enzyme responsible for DNA replication. The isolation and characterization of this new polymerase involved in semiconservative DNA replication followed, in parallel studies conducted by several labs. The new polymerase was termed DNA polymerase II, and was believed to be the main replicative enzyme of \"E. coli\" for a time. DNA pol II was first crystallized by Anderson et. Al in 1994.",

Functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to make use of the vast wealth of data given by genomic and transcriptomic projects (such as genome sequencing projects and RNA sequencing) to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. Unlike structural genomics, functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription, translation, regulation of gene expression and protein\u2013protein interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional \u201cgene-by-gene\u201d approach. The goal of functional genomics is to understand the function of larger numbers of genes or proteins, eventually all components of a genome. A more long-term goal is to understand the relationship between an organism's genome and its phenotype. The term functional genomics is often used broadly to refer to the many technical approaches to study an organism's genes and proteins, including the \"biochemical, cellular, and/or physiological properties of each and every gene product\" while some authors include the study of nongenic elements in his definition. Functional genomics may also include studies of natural genetic variation over time (such as an organism's development) or space (such as its body regions), as well as functional disruptions such as mutations.",
