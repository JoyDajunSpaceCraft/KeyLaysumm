This mechanism falls under the second general mechanism for beta-lactam resistance. PBPs, also known as transpeptidases, are targets for beta-lactams. These enzymes (PBPs) are involved in peptidoglycan synthesis which is a major component of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs cross-link the amino acid strands of peptidoglycan during synthesis. Normally, beta-lactams bind the PBPs and thereby inhibit the cross-linking of peptidoglycan. When this occurs, the cell wall of the bacterium is compromised and often results in cell death.

            "document": "Bacterial morphological plasticity . For \"Burkholderia pseudomallei\", some clinical antibiotic agents that are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some \u03b2-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the \"minimal inhibitory concentration\" (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. However, the \"B.pseudomallei\" filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. Furthermore, for \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\", filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (\"lipopolysaccharide, LPS\") release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol. The molecular correlate of the filament formation was described. The exposure to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics induced the SOS response in \"Escherichia coli\". During repair of DNA damage, the SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division. Moreover, both \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and genetic mutation induce SOS in \"E.coli\" through the DpiBA \"two-component signal transduction system\" leading to the inactivation of the ftsl gene product, penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP-3). The ftsl gene is a group of filamentous temperature-sensitive genes implicated in cell division. In addition, it is a membrane transpeptidase required for peptidoglycan synthesis at the septum generated by cell division. The event to inactivate ftsl gene product requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA and transiently inhibits bacterial cell division. Consequently, the bactericidal effects of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are limited. The DpiA is the effector for the DpiB two-component system. Interaction of DpiA with replication origins competes with the binding of the replication proteins DnaA and DnaB. When overexpressed, DpiA can interrupt DNA replication and induce the SOS response resulting in inhibition of cell division.",

This enzyme is most commonly known as being responsible for the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. Through experimentation it was found that this enzyme is able to construct these cell walls by synthesizing D-glutamate from L-glutamate through racemization. D-glutamate is a monomer of the peptidoglycan layer in prokaryotic cell walls. Peptidoglycan is an essential structural component of the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan layer is also responsible for the rigidity of the cell wall. This process, in which MurI helps catalyze the interconversion of glutamate enantiomers, like L-Glutamate, into the essential D-glutamate, is also cofactor independent. As such it can proceed without needing an additional source, which would bind to an allosteric site, altering the enzyme shape to assist in catalyzing the reaction. Murl involves a two-step process to catalyze the glutamate enantiomers to D-glutamate. The first step is a deprotonation of the substrate to form an anion. Subsequently, the substrate gets reprotonated. Once the glutamate is in the active site of the enzyme it undergoes a very large conformational change of its domains. This change helps superimpose the two catalytic cysteine residues, Cys73 and Cys184, located on either sides of the substrate at equal positions. Those domains mentioned earlier are symmetric and this symmetry suggests that this racemase activity of the protein may have evolved from gene duplication. Due to this main function of biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls MurI has been targeted as an antibacterial in drug discovery.",

The two organisms upon which the \u2018minimal gene set for cellular life' was applied were: \"Haemophilus influenzae\", and \"M. genitalium\". A list of orthologous proteins were compiled in hope that it would contain protein necessary for cell survival, as orthologous analysis determines how two organisms evolved and shed away any non-essential genes. Since, \"H. influenza\" and \"M. genitalium\" are Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria and due to their vast evolution it was expected that these organisms would be enriched genes that were of universal importance. However, 244 detected orthologs discovered contained no parasitism-specific proteins. The conclusion of this analysis was that similar biochemical functions might be performed by non-orthologous proteins. Even when biochemical pathways of these two organisms were mapped, several pathways were present but many were incomplete. Proteins determined to be common between the two organisms were non-orthologous to each other. Much of the research mainly focuses on the ancestral genome and less on the minimal genome. Studies of these existing genomes have helped determine that orthologous genes found in these two species are not necessarily essential for survival, in fact non-orthologous genes were found to be more important. Also, it was determined that in order for proteins to share same functions they do not need to have same sequence or common three dimensional folds. Distinguishing between orthologs and paralogs and detecting displacements of orthologs have been quiet beneficial in reconstructing evolution and determining the minimal gene set required for a cellular life. Instead, of conducting a strict orthology study, comparing groups of orthologs and occurrence in most clades instead of every species helped encounter genes lost or displaced. Only genomes that have been completely sequenced have enabled in studying orthologs among group of organisms.

As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is made up of a polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating N-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) residues in equal amounts. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. extracellular parasites such as \"Mycoplasma\") contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures.

However, the mecA gene codes for PBP2a, that has a lower affinity for antibiotic drugs, which keeps the structural integrity of the cell wall, preventing cell death. The synthesis of the bacterial cell wall in \"S. aureus\" is dependent on transglycosylation, to form linear polymer of sugar monomers, and transpeptidation, to form an interlinking peptides to strengthen the newly developed cell wall. PBPs have a transpeptidase domain, but transglycosylation was thought to only be carried out by monofunctional enzymes, however PBP2 has domains to carry out both essential processes. When antibiotics are introduced to the medium, they bind to the transpetidation domain and inhibit the ability of PBPs to cross-link muropeptides therefore preventing the formation of stable cell wall. but in a cooperative action, PBP2a lacks the proper receptor for the antibiotics, continuing the transpeptidation, preventing the breakdown of the cell wall. The functionality of PBP2a is dependent on two structural factors on the cell wall of \"S. aureus.\" First, there in order for PBP2a to properly fit onto the cell wall, to continue transpeptidation, requires proper amino acid residues, specifically a pentaglycine residue and an amidated glutamate residue. Furthermore, PBP2a has an effective transpeptidase activity, but lacks a transglycosylation domain of PBP2, which builds the backbone of the cell wall with polysaccharide monomers, and so PBP2a must rely on PBP2 to continue this process. The latter of these factors is an enzymatic reaction that can be targeted to improve the ability of beta-lactams to prevent cell wall synthesis in resistant \"S.\" aureus. Identification of genetic inhibitors of glycosylases involved in the cell wall synthesis, and modulating the expression of these inhibitors can resensitize these previously resistant bacteria to beta-lactam treatment. for example, Epicatechin gallate, a compound found in green tea, has shown signs of lowering the resistance to beta-lactams, to the point where oxacillin becomes effective to inhibit the formation of the cell wall, by inhibiting PBP2 and PBP2a.",

The host defense antimicrobial peptide protegrin I (PG-1), exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and good activity against multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens, with a mechanism consistent with membrane disruption via pore formation. However, PG-1 exhibits unfavorable drug properties and also exhibits significant hemolysis and, as such, has limited clinical use. PG-1 contains 18 amino acids and is ordered into an anti-parallel \u03b2-strand by two disulfide bridges. A fully synthetic cyclic peptide-like molecule containing a D-proline\u2013L-proline template grafted into a peptidomimetic scaffold to simulate and stabilize the beta hairpin conformation exhibited by PG-1 was used to generate a diverse library of peptidomimetic macrocycles which were screened for antibacterial activity. Variants in this 14-residue protein epitope mimetic (PEM) library such as the peptidomimetic L8-1 had an antimicrobial activity like that of PG-1 but with reduced hemolytic activity on human red blood cells. Iterative rounds of synthesis generated analogues with an increasingly potent and selective profile producing nanomolar range compounds specifically against Pseudomonas spp. at the expense of broad-spectrum activity. Final optimization led to the discovery of murepavadin, with remarkable Pseudomonas-specific activity \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" that has high plasma stability across species and is non-hemolytic at 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) studies showed that aromatic side chains of Trp2 and Trp8 are very important for antibiotic activity, while NMR studies showed that these potent D-Pro-L-Pro antibiotic derivatives had a stable \u03b2- hairpin conformation in aqueous solution whereas related derivatives with the D-Pro-L-Pro template inverted to L-Pro-D-Pro, shows no stable hairpin conformation and the antimicrobial activity was lost, suggesting that the \u03b2-hairpin structure is crucial for interaction with the bacterial target. Murepavadin functions through a novel mechanism of action by binding to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transport protein D (LptD), an outer membrane protein involved in lipopolysaccharide biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria. By binding to LptD, murepavadin inhibit the LPS transport function of LptD and causes lipopolysaccharide alterations in the outer membrane of the bacterium and, ultimately, cell death.",

            "document": "Chemical biology . The advances in modern sequencing technologies in the late 1990s allowed scientists to investigate DNA of communities of organisms in their natural environments, so-called \"eDNA\", without culturing individual species in the lab. This metagenomic approach enabled scientists to study a wide selection of organisms that were previously not characterized due in part to an incompetent growth condition. These sources of eDNA include, but are not limited to, soils, ocean, subsurface, hot springs, hydrothermal vents, polar ice caps, hypersaline habitats, and extreme pH environments. Of the many applications of metagenomics, chemical biologists and microbiologists such as Jo Handelsman, Jon Clardy, and Robert M. Goodman who are pioneers of metagenomics, explored metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of biologically active molecules such as antibiotics. Functional or homology screening strategies have been used to identify genes that produce small bioactive molecules. Functional metagenomic studies are designed to search for specific phenotypes that are associated with molecules with specific characteristics. Homology metagenomic studies, on the other hand, are designed to examine genes to identify conserved sequences that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules. Functional metagenomic studies enable scientists to discover novel genes that encode biologically active molecules. These assays include top agar overlay assays where antibiotics generate zones of growth inhibition against test microbes, and pH assays that can screen for pH change due to newly synthesized molecules using pH indicator on an agar plate. Substrate-induced gene expression screening (SIGEX), a method to screen for the expression of genes that are induced by chemical compounds, has also been used to search genes with specific functions. These led to the discovery and isolation of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, the Schipper group identified three eDNA derived AHL lactonases that inhibit biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via functional metagenomic assays. However, these functional screening methods require a good design of probes that detect molecules being synthesized and depend on the ability to express metagenomes in a host organism system. In contrast, homology metagenomic studies led to a faster discovery of genes that have homologous sequences as the previously known genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of biologically active molecules. As soon as the genes are sequenced, scientists can compare thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously. The advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes, thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes. These also led to the discovery of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, Banik et al. screened for clones containing genes associated with the synthesis of teicoplanin and vancomycin-like glycopeptide antibiotics and found two new biosynthetic gene clusters. In addition, an \"in silico\" examination from the Global Ocean Metagenomic Survey found 20 new lantibiotic cyclases.  There are challenges to metagenomic approaches to discover new biologically active molecules. Only 40% of enzymatic activities present in a sample can be expressed in \"E. coli.\". In addition, the purification and isolation of eDNA is essential but difficult when the sources of obtained samples are poorly understood. However, collaborative efforts from individuals from diverse fields including bacterial genetics, molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, robots, synthetic biology, and chemistry can solve this problem together and potentially lead to the discovery of many important biologically active molecules.",

In addition, proteins function together and interact with proteins of other pathways, therefore it is important to view the effects of natural selection on bio-molecular pathways rather than on individual proteins. With that being said, it was found that proteins in the periphery of the pathway are enriched in copy number variations whereas proteins in the center of the pathways are depleted in copy number variations.

FAD imitators that are able to bind in a similar manner but do not permit protein function could be useful mechanisms of inhibiting bacterial infection.

As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is made up of a polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating N-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) residues in equal amounts. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. extracellular parasites such as \"Mycoplasma\") contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. Since the cell wall is required for bacterial survival, but is absent in some eukaryotes, several antibiotics (notably the penicillins and cephalosporins) stop bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis, while having no effects on human cells which have no cell wall only a cell membrane. There are two main types of bacterial cell walls, those of gram-positive bacteria and those of gram-negative bacteria, which are differentiated by their Gram staining characteristics.

An antibiotic derived from some \"Penicillium\" fungal species, penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a bacterial cell wall. The four-membered \u03b2-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme DD-transpeptidase, an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of \u03b2-lactam to DD-transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme\u2019s functionality and it can no longer catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common, and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant \u03b2-lactam antibiotic (for example, oxacillin or flucloxacillin, both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin). Combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections, such as endocarditis, but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys. The duration of treatment depends on the site of infection and on severity. Adjunctive rifampicin has been historically used in the management of \"S aureus\" bacteraemia, but randomised controlled trial evidence has shown this to be of no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy.",

This enzyme is most commonly known as being responsible for the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. Through experimentation it was found that this enzyme is able to construct these cell walls by synthesizing D-glutamate from L-glutamate through racemization. D-glutamate is a monomer of the peptidoglycan layer in prokaryotic cell walls. Peptidoglycan is an essential structural component of the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan layer is also responsible for the rigidity of the cell wall. This process, in which MurI helps catalyze the interconversion of glutamate enantiomers, like L-Glutamate, into the essential D-glutamate, is also cofactor independent. As such it can proceed without needing an additional source, which would bind to an allosteric site, altering the enzyme shape to assist in catalyzing the reaction. Murl involves a two-step process to catalyze the glutamate enantiomers to D-glutamate. The first step is a deprotonation of the substrate to form an anion. Subsequently, the substrate gets reprotonated. Once the glutamate is in the active site of the enzyme it undergoes a very large conformational change of its domains. This change helps superimpose the two catalytic cysteine residues, Cys73 and Cys184, located on either sides of the substrate at equal positions. Those domains mentioned earlier are symmetric and this symmetry suggests that this racemase activity of the protein may have evolved from gene duplication. Due to this main function of biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls MurI has been targeted as an antibacterial in drug discovery.",

D-alanyl-D-alanine is a residue on the NAM peptide subunit involved in building peptidoglycan. Carbapenem covalently binds to PBPs, which causes transpeptidases to irreversibly lose their catalytic activity. Inhibition of transpeptidases prevents the formation of cross-links between peptidoglycan polymers and causes a build-up of peptidoglycan precursors.

It is in the membrane where a lipid carrier called bactoprenol carries peptidoglycan precursors through the cell membrane. Bactoprenol will attack the UDP-MurNAc penta, creating a PP-MurNac penta, which is now a lipid. UDP-GlcNAc is then transported to MurNAc, creating Lipid-PP-MurNAc penta-GlcNAc, a disaccharide, also a precursor to peptidoglycan. How this molecule is transported through the membrane is still not understood. However, once it is there, it is added to the growing glycan chain. The next reaction is known as tranglycosylation. In the reaction, the hydroxyl group of the GlcNAc will attach to the MurNAc in the glycan, which will displace the lipid-PP from the glycan chain. The enzyme responsible for this is transglycosylase. Some antibacterial drugs such as penicillin interfere with the production of peptidoglycan by binding to bacterial enzymes known as penicillin-binding proteins or DD-transpeptidases. Penicillin-binding proteins form the bonds between oligopeptide crosslinks in peptidoglycan. For a bacterial cell to reproduce through binary fission, more than a million peptidoglycan subunits (NAM-NAG+oligopeptide) must be attached to existing subunits.

For \"Burkholderia pseudomallei\", some clinical antibiotic agents that are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some \u03b2-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the \"minimal inhibitory concentration\" (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. However, the \"B.pseudomallei\" filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. Furthermore, for \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\", filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (\"lipopolysaccharide, LPS\") release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol. The molecular correlate of the filament formation was described. The exposure to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics induced the SOS response in \"Escherichia coli\". During repair of DNA damage, the SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division. Moreover, both \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and genetic mutation induce SOS in \"E.coli\" through the DpiBA \"two-component signal transduction system\" leading to the inactivation of the ftsl gene product, penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP-3). The ftsl gene is a group of filamentous temperature-sensitive genes implicated in cell division. In addition, it is a membrane transpeptidase required for peptidoglycan synthesis at the septum generated by cell division. The event to inactivate ftsl gene product requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA and transiently inhibits bacterial cell division. Consequently, the bactericidal effects of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are limited. The DpiA is the effector for the DpiB two-component system. Interaction of DpiA with replication origins competes with the binding of the replication proteins DnaA and DnaB. When overexpressed, DpiA can interrupt DNA replication and induce the SOS response resulting in inhibition of cell division.",
