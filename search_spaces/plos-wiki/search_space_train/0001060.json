As with Hebert's results, each species sequenced had a unique barcode and intraspecific COI sequence variance ranged from 0 to 1.24%. To determine new species, a standard sequence threshold of 2.7% COI sequence difference was set. This value is 10 times the average intraspecies difference of North American birds, which is inconsistent with Hebert's recommendation that the threshold value be based on the group under study. Using this value, the group detected six moa species. In addition, a further standard sequence threshold of 1.24% was also used. This value resulted in 10 moa species which corresponded with the previously known species with one exception. This exception suggested a possible complex of species which was previously unidentified. Given the slow rate of growth and reproduction of moa, it is probable that the interspecies variation is rather low. On the other hand, there is no set value of molecular difference at which populations can be assumed to have irrevocably started to undergo speciation.

Deforestation, with the establishment of settlements at the periphery of primary or secondary forest, increases the risk of \"Leishmania\" transmission by creating a selection pressure for the adaptation of sand flies to these new peridomestic environments.

In the natural environment, \"Wolbachia\" and the Asian tiger mosquito are in a symbiotic relationship, so both species benefit from each other and can evolve together. The relationship between \"Wolbachia\" and its host might not have always been mutualistic, as \"Drosophila\" populations once experienced decreased fecundity in infected females, suggesting that \"Wolbachia\" evolved over time so that infected individuals would actually reproduce much more. The mechanism by which \"Wolbachia\" is inherited through maternal heredity is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. This changes the gamete cells of males and females, making some individuals unable to mate with each other. Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists, \"Wolbachia\" infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a population exposed to \"Wolbachia\" transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations. This is called population replacement, where the population\u2019s overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype. This shows how populations of Asian tiger mosquitoes can vary in number of \"Wolbachia\"-infected individuals, based on how often the infection is transmitted.

In addition to the genetic causes of reproductive isolation between species there is another factor that can cause post zygotic isolation: the presence of microorganisms in the cytoplasm of certain species.

For example, in the semi-species of the group \"D. paulistorum\" the hybrid females are fertile but the males are sterile, this is due to the presence of a \"Wolbachia\" in the cytoplasm which alters spermatogenesis leading to sterility. It is interesting that incompatibility or isolation can also arise at an intraspecific level. Populations of \"D. simulans\" have been studied that show hybrid sterility according to the direction of the cross. The factor determining sterility has been found to be the presence or absence of a microorganism \"Wolbachia\" and the populations tolerance or susceptibility to these organisms. This inter population incompatibility can be eliminated in the laboratory through the administration of a specific antibiotic to kill the microorganism. Similar situations are known in a number of insects, as around 15% of species show infections caused by this symbiont.

CI, as described by Werren, results in selection pressure on uninfected females, as infected females can mate both with uninfected males and infected males, but uninfected females cannot mate with infected males. As \"Wolbachia\" are only transmitted by females, this mechanism promotes the spread of \"Wolbachia\" and therefore keeps \"Wolbachia\" from dying out because of incomplete transmission. This has led to discoveries in control of disease transmission by using Wolbachia to control the reproduction of a population by introducing \"Wolbachia\"-infected males. This has been seen in the Aedes, mosquito, family, in the \"Aedes albopictus\" and \"Aedes aegypti\" species.",

This could lead to many more discoveries in disease control for \"Ae. albopictus\" and other mosquito species. In addition, due to the cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by \"Wolbachia\", the artificial infection of males can serve as a biological control as they are unable to reproduce successfully with uninfected females (unidirectional CI). When artificially infected males are unable to reproduce, the population size can be controlled, thereby reducing the transmission of the harmful disease of interest. Artificial infection of males is achieved by the removal of cytoplasm from infected oocytes, which is then transferred into embryos prior to the blastoderm stage.",
