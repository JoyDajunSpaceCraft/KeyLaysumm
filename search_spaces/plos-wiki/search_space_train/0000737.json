Urban populations and mosquito-infested slums in Asia and Africa are much larger than in the past. A commentary and accompanying article published in May stressed the potential for spread to Asia by international air travel. Other parts of the world where yellow fever is present but usually in the quiescent jungle cycle, and where there is regular air travel, such as Brazil, may also be vulnerable. They stressed that world stocks of 7 million doses of vaccine have been exhausted in the vaccination campaign against the outbreak in Angola. If yellow fever spread to the 18 countries in Asia where the mosquito vector is present, more than 2 billion people would be at risk. They stated: \"Apocalyptic forecasts of the numbers of fatalities from Ebola turned out to be wildly wrong, and we can hope that will again be the case here, but given the way Zika has exploded in the Western hemisphere, we can't count on it.\" CDC said they could not assist as much in the outbreak because all its experts were involved in efforts against the Zika virus outbreak in the Americas.

            "document": "Dengue fever . Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs. Dengue is spread by several species of mosquito of the \"Aedes\" type, principally \"A. aegypti\". The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA. A vaccine for dengue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is recommended instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for fever reduction and pain relief in dengue due to an increased risk of bleeding from NSAID use. Dengue has become a global problem since the Second World War and is common in more than 110\u00a0countries. Each year between 50 and 528\u00a0million people are infected and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die. The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779. Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.",

These traps have had success in some countries to control \"Aedes\" mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of \"Ae. albopictus\". This device, with the help of a ventilator, produces an upward air current of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and smell of a human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult tiger mosquitoes, and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics.

For example, because a bird must select habitat on several scales (a habitat patch, an individual territory within that patch, as well as a nest site within the territory), traps may operate on any one of these scales. Similarly, traps may operate on a temporal scale so that an altered environment may appear to cause a trap in one stage of an organism\u2019s life, yet have positive effects on later life stages. As a result, there has been a great deal of uncertainty as to how common traps may be, despite widespread acceptance as a theoretical possibility. However, given the accelerated rate of ecological change driven by human land-use change, global warming, exotic species invasions, and changes in ecological communities resulting from species loss, ecological traps may be an increasing and highly underappreciated threat to biodiversity.",

Lethal ovitraps can either contain substances that kills larvae that hatch from eggs laid in the traps (larvicidal ovitraps), or substances that kill the adult mosquito when she enters, along with any larva that may hatch (adulticidal ovitraps). While larvicidal ovitraps only reduce larval growth, they do not kill the adult mosquitoes that may carry diseases. Adulticidal ovitraps act to kill the viremic (disease-carrying) female mosquitoes and act to directly stop disease transmission.",

These plants like palm trees or any plants with axils capable of trapping water, are potential breeding sites. Holes in tree trunks is also a concern, and NParks workers have been filling these holes with sands. NParks has engaged 16 pest companies to stop mosquito breeding in the parks it manages. Due to the dengue threat, some schools are cancelling excursions to the parks.",

First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until it perceives host stimulants, whereupon it secondly takes a targeted approach.

            "document": "Hydrodynamic trapping . Several approaches were applied in microfluidics facilitating single cell trapping for single cell analysis, which can be broadly classified into contact based approach and contact-less approach. Different cell trapping methods are hydrodynamic trapping, dielectrophoresis trapping, chemical trapping, gel trapping, magnetic trapping, acoustic trapping and laser trapping. Each method has its own merits and demerits. Mostly these process requires auxiliary facilities like a pump or a pressurecontrolling system for fluid introduction and guidance, and some need specialized electronics or optical equipment which are not common in a medical or biological laboratory and induce further obstacles for operation. The auxiliary parts occupy much space and thereby greatly lowers the area density of single-cell arrays. Design structures of many microfluidic chips are complicated due to the need for multiple layers, channels, and valves, which are difficult to either fabricate or manipulate. Thus the practical applications in clinics or general biological laboratories are limited due to these drawbacks. Increasing demand for trapping based on the design itself, involving unsophisticated basic laboratory instruments for single cell measurements led to the evolution of hydrodynamic trapping technique. This way, cells which may be affected due to the presence of an external field/force are preserved. Apart from the simplicity of the process, the natural state of the separated particles can be useful for many kinds research. Based on the approach used, hydrodynamic trapping can be broadly classified into the contact-based and contact-less approach. Figure 1 shows the diverse approaches involved in single cell trapping. Different principal mechanisms were used in hydrodynamic trapping as shown in Figure 2. Hydrodynamic trapping mechanism includes cross-stream migration, vortices based trapping and externally controlled signal approach. Hydrodynamic trapping can also be used to trap and study molecules in lipid bilayers. This is done using hydrodynamic drag forces that are created by a fluid flow through a very small cone shaped pipet located about one micrometer away from the lipid bilayer. This allows particles protruding from the lipid bilayer to be trapped and studied.",
