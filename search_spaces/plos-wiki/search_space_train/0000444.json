Lactate threshold or anaerobic threshold is considered a good indicator of the body's ability to efficiently process and transfer chemical energy into mechanical energy. Although the marathon is considered an aerobic dominant exercise, higher intensities associated with elite performance uses a larger percentage of anaerobic energy. The lactate threshold is the cross over point between predominantly aerobic energy usage and anaerobic energy usage. This cross over is associated with the anaerobic energy system's inability to efficiently produce energy leading to the buildup of blood lactate often associated with muscle fatigue. In endurance trained athletes, the increase in blood lactate concentration appears at about 75%-90%VO, which directly corresponds to the VO marathoner's run at. With this high of an intensity endured for over 2 hours, a marathon runner's performance requires more energy production than that solely supplied by mitochondrial activity. This is the reason for a higher anaerobic to aerobic energy ratio during the marathon.

A marathoner's running economy is their sub maximal requirement for oxygen at specific speeds. This concept of running economy helps to explain different marathon time's for runners with very similar aerobic capacities. The steady state oxygen consumption used to define running economy demonstrates the energy cost of running at sub maximal speeds. This is often measured by the volume of oxygen consumed, either in liters or milliliters, per kilogram of body weight per minute (L/kg/min or mL/kg/min). Discrepancies in time of winning performances of various marathon runners with almost identical VO and %VO values can be explained by different levels of oxygen consumption per minute at the same speeds. For this reason it can be seen that Jim McDonagh has run the marathon faster than Ted Corbitt in his winning performances compared to that of Corbitt. This greater requirement for sub maximal oxygen consumption (3.3L of oxygen per minute for Corbitt vs. 3.0L of oxygen per minute for McDonagh) is positively correlated with a greater level of energy expenditure while running the same speed.",

Lactate threshold or anaerobic threshold is considered a good indicator of the body's ability to efficiently process and transfer chemical energy into mechanical energy. Although the marathon is considered an aerobic dominant exercise, higher intensities associated with elite performance uses a larger percentage of anaerobic energy. The lactate threshold is the cross over point between predominantly aerobic energy usage and anaerobic energy usage. This cross over is associated with the anaerobic energy system's inability to efficiently produce energy leading to the buildup of blood lactate often associated with muscle fatigue. In endurance trained athletes, the increase in blood lactate concentration appears at about 75%-90%VO, which directly corresponds to the VO marathoner's run at. With this high of an intensity endured for over 2 hours, a marathon runner's performance requires more energy production than that solely supplied by mitochondrial activity.

Dehydration refers both to hypohydration (dehydration induced prior to exercise) and to exercise-induced dehydration (dehydration that develops during exercise). The latter reduces aerobic endurance performance and results in increased body temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and possibly increased reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source. Although the negative effects of exercise-induced dehydration on exercise performance were clearly demonstrated in the 1940s, athletes continued to believe for years thereafter that fluid intake was not beneficial. More recently, negative effects on performance have been demonstrated with modest (<2%) dehydration, and these effects are exacerbated when the exercise is performed in a hot environment. The effects of hypohydration may vary, depending on whether it is induced through diuretics or sauna exposure, which substantially reduce plasma volume, or prior exercise, which has much less impact on plasma volume. Hypohydration reduces aerobic endurance, but its effects on muscle strength and endurance are not consistent and require further study. Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by sweat-based thermoregulation. A male marathon runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower). People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine. This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35\u00a0\u00b0C) with minimal fluid intake causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper fluid intake, higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat.",

It is used in many sports that incorporate running, typically as a way of quickly reaching a target or goal, or avoiding or catching an opponent. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than 30\u201335 seconds due to the depletion of phosphocreatine stores in muscles, and perhaps secondarily to excessive metabolic acidosis as a result of anaerobic glycolysis.",

At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400\u00a0m indoors. Races up to 100\u00a0m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation. Top speed can only be maintained for up to 20\u00a0metres.",

            "document": "Physiology of marathons . Environmental factors such as air resistance, rain, terrain, and heat all contribute to a marathon runner's ability to perform at the full potential of their physiological characteristics. Air resistance or wind and the physical terrain of the marathon course (hilly or flat) were often associated with increased insensities in order to maintain pace. The rain can affect a marathon runner's performance by adding weight to the attire of the marathon runner causing their overall load to carry to be slightly heavier. Temperature, in particular the heat, is the strongest contributor of environmental factors leading to poorer marathon performance. An increase in air temperature affects all the runners the same. This negative correlation of increased temperature and decreased race time is affiliated with marathon runners' hospitalizations and exercise induced hyperthermia. There are other environmental factors less directly associated with marathon performance such as the pollutants in the air and even prize money associated with a specific marathon itself.",

The first race was held on September 25, 1977 under the original name the Mayor Daley Marathon, which drew a field of 4,200 runners. The race has been held every year since, except in 1987 when only a half-marathon was run. It is among the fastest growing marathon road races in the world, due in part to its largely fast and flat course which facilitates the pursuit of personal records and world record performances. The race has achieved its elite status among marathons by developing relationships with sponsors who provide prize money to lure elite runners who have produced American and world record performances. Since 2008 the race has been sponsored by Bank of America, and is officially known as the Bank of America Chicago Marathon.",

This energy pathway typically supplies the bulk of the body's energy during exercise after 3 minutes from the onset of exercise until the end of the exercise or when the individual experiences fatigue. This energy pathway is used for lower intensity exercise that lasts longer than 3 minutes, which corresponds to the rate at which ATP is produced using oxygen. This energy system is essential to endurance athletes such as marathon runners, triathletes, cross-country skiers, etc. The Aerobic Energy Pathway is able to produce the largest amount of ATP out of these three systems. This is largely in part to this energy system's ability to use fats, carbohydrates, and protein in conjunction with its capacity for converting these macro-nutrients into a state capable of entering the mitochondria, the site of aerobic ATP production.",

An inability to reduce rising core body temperature can lead to hyperthermia. In order to reduce bodily heat, the metabolically produced heat needs to be removed from the body via sweating (also known as evaporative cooling). The dissipation of heat by sweat evaporation can lead to significant losses of water from the body. A marathon runner can lose enough body fluid to lose about 8% of their total body weight. Replacement of fluid is limited but can help keep the body's internal temperatures cooler. Fluid replacement is physiologically challenging during exercise of this intensity due to the inefficient emptying of the stomach. Partial fluid replacement can serve to avoid a marathon runner's body over heating but not enough to keep pace with the loss of fluid via sweat evaporation.",
