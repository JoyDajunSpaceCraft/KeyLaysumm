Nucleosides must be triphosphorylated, while nucleotides, which possess one phosphonated group, must be diphosphorylated. This stepwise activation process occurs inside the cell and is mediated by a coordinated series of enzymes. The first, and often rate limiting, phosphorylation step (for nucleoside analogues) are most commonly catalyzed by deoxynucleoside kinases. Addition of the second phosphate group to nucleoside monophosphate analogues is completed by the nucleoside monophosphate kinases (NMP kinases). A variety of enzymes are able to catalyze the final phosphorylation step for NRTIs, including nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase), phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase and creatine kinase, resulting in formation of respective antivirally active triphosphate analogues. In their respective triphosphate forms, NRTIs and the only NtRTI available compete with their corresponding endogenous deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) for incorporation into the nascent DNA chain (see figure 1). Unlike dNTPs substrate, NRTIs lack a 3\u00b4-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. Once incorporated into the DNA chain, the absence of a 3\u00b4-hydroxyl group, which normally forms the 5\u00b4- to 3\u00b4- phosphoester bond with the next nucleic acid, blocks further extension of the DNA by RT, and they act as chain terminators.",

Below is a simplified pathway that displays dCK's role in synthesizing nucleotides using the nucleoside salvage pathway.

The conjugate (10S,11S) JH diol phosphate is the product of a two-step enzymatic process: conversion of JH to JH diol and then addition of a phosphate group to C10. The enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of JH diol is JH diol kinase (JHDK), which was first characterized from the Malpighian tubules of early fifth instars of \"M. sexta\". JHDK (EC 2.1.7.3) was discovered when an analysis of JH I metabolites in vivo yielded, in addition to the expected metabolites, a very polar JH I conjugate that was subsequently identified as JH I diol phosphate. Maxwell et al. showed JHDK to contain 3 potential calcium binding sites, and a single ATP-Mg2+ binding site (p-loop). The modeled structure contains nine helices, one beta sheet, and 10 loops. JHDK is also present in the silkworm, where it also functions as homodimer. It lacks a JH response element; Li et al. (2005). It has a high degree of identity to \"M. sexta\" JHDK. Later Uno et al. (2007) characterized the \"A. mellifera\" enzyme in a proteomic study. It has 183 amino acid residues. More recently, Zeng et al. (2015) have characterized JHDK from \"Spodoptera litura\". It also has 183 amino acid residues, just as does the \"B. mori\" enzyme. These enzymes all have high sequence similarity. The M. sexta enzyme contains 184 residues. JHDK from \"M. sexta\" Malpighian tubules is a cytosolic protein composed of two identical subunits of 20 kDa, as determined by MS. Gel filtration studies indicate it has a molecular mass of approximately 43 kDa. JHDK displays a \"K\" in the nanomolar range for JH I diol, which is appropriate for an enzyme responsible for clearance of a hormone whose titers rarely exceeds 10 nM. Most significantly, the catalytic activity of JHDK parallels developmentally that of JHEH, a requisite if JH diol phosphate is a legitimate terminal metabolite. Analysis of the \"k\"cat/\"K\" ratio for the diols of JH I, II, and III indicates that JH I diol is the preferred substrate, suggesting a preference for an ethyl group at the C7 position. JHDK requires both Mg and ATP for activity. Characterization of the juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase (JHEH) and juvenile hormone diol phosphotransferase (JHDPT) from \"Manduca sexta\" Malpighian tubules. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 30, 255-270 ), although excess Mg and Ca inhibit its activity. The specificity of JHDK for JH I diol is relatively high, considering the multitude of potential phosphate acceptor groups present in a cell. The enzyme does not recognize methyl geranoate diol (one isoprenyl unit shorter than JH) nor methyl geranylgeranoate diol (one isoprenyl group longer than JH), yet it does recognize JH I ethyl ester diol. It also recognizes both JH diol enantiomers, indicating that the absolute stereospecificity of the hydroxy groups is of minor importance. Most surprising is the enzyme's inability to recognize JH acid diols. Because JH acid diol cannot be phosphorylated by JHDK, the generally accepted pathway for JH catabolism (JH acid is converted to JH acid diol) must be reconsidered. Still, the role of cellular JHE becomes problematic if the pathway catalyzed by JHEH and JHDK is the major pathway for JH catabolism in the cell. The fact that JH diol phosphate is a significant metabolite certainly weakens the long-held dogma that JH esterase is most important in JH catabolism. While JHE has been noted to have phosphatase activity, to our knowledge it has never been tested on JH diol phosphate. The sequence and hypothetical structures of \"M. sexta\", \"D. melanogaster\", and \"B. mori\" JHDK have been analyzed. A partial characterization of JHDK from whole-body homogenates of D. melanogaster indicates that it is similar to the enzyme in M. sexta, with the exception of its subunit structure. The active D. melanogaster JHDK is a monomer of ~20 kDa, while the active \"M. sexta\" (GenBank accession number: AJ430670) and \"B. mori\" JHDKs (GenBank accession number: AY363308) are composed of two identical 20 kDa subunits. Similarities in chromatographic properties, isoelectric point, and enzyme activity led to conclude that sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein 2 (dSCP2) is the probable \"D. melanogaster\" homologue of M. sexta JHDK. The \"M. sexta\" gene codes for an enzyme that has 59% sequence identity and >80% similarity to dSCP2 of \"D. melanogaster\" (GenBank accession number: AF093240; CG14904). Li et al. reported that the \"B. mori\" JHDK is composed of a single exon of 637 bp. The \"B. mori\" JHDK is expressed most prevalently in the gut, as determined by Northern blot analyses, and is not under the direct control of JH at the transcriptional level. Maxwell et al. generated a 3D model that they used for in silico docking simulations. This model is shown in the attached figure . They capitalized on the facts that the catalytic site of JHDK must contain a purine (GTP) binding site and hydrophobic pocket for JH diol, and that the scaffolding for dSCP2 is known. Surrounding the putative substrate-binding site, both the \"M. sexta\" and \"D. melanogaster\" JHDKs contain the three conserved nucleotide-binding elements common to nucleotide binding proteins. The model further demonstrates that the protein contains four domains that form two pairs of a helix-loop-helix motif (EF-hand;. Charge interactions in the hydrophobic binding pocket, as well as its depth (19 \u00c2), are complementary to the extended conformation of the diol. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket complements the C1 ester of the substrate and supports the observation that JH diol is the only substrate for this enzyme.",

Inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme prolongs and enhances the activity of incretins that play an important role in insulin secretion and blood glucose control regulation. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that results from inability of the \u03b2-cells in the pancreas to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin to meet the body's needs. Insulin resistance and increased hepatic glucose production can also play a role by increasing the body's demand for insulin. Current treatments, other than insulin supplementation, are sometimes not sufficient to achieve control and may cause undesirable side effects, such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. In recent years, new drugs have been developed, based on continuing research into the mechanism of insulin production and regulation of the metabolism of sugar in the body. The enzyme DPP-4 has been found to play a significant role. Since its discovery in 1967, serine protease DPP-4 has been a popular subject of research. Inhibitors of DPP-4 have long been sought as tools to elucidate the functional significance of the enzyme. The first inhibitors were characterized in the late 1980s and 1990s.

It should be noted that the inhibitors fall into two main classes, those that interact covalently with DPP-4 and those that do not. DPP-4 is a dipeptidase that selectively binds substrates that contain proline at the P1-position, thus many DPP-4 inhibitors have 5-membered heterocyclic rings that mimic proline, e.g. pyrrolidine, cyanopyrrolidine, thiazolidine and cyanothiazolidine.

With these promising preclinical studies, ispinesib (SB-715992; Cytokinetics/GSK), SB-743921 from Cytokinetics/GSK, MK-0731 from Merck, filanesib (ARRY-520) (Array BioPharma), and litronesib (LY2523355) (Eli Lilly) have entered into clinical trials. Although second-generation Kinesin-5 inhibitors have had better success, none have been fully developed and marketed as an anti-cancer treatment. The role of specific residues in the L5 pocket (L5, \u03b12, and \u03b13) in human Kinesin-5 has been tested, but not yet been systematically explored. The initial goal of these mutation experiments was to determine which residues had greatest pharmacological importance in drug development. For example, mutations in the KIF11 gene convey resistance of mitotic cell lines to inhibitors such as monastrol and STLC. For example, point mutations in the inhibitor binding pocket, R119A, D130A, L132A, I136A, L214A and E215A confer resistance to monastrol, while R119A, D130A and L214A mutations confer resistance to STLC. In contrast to the loss-of-function experiments, a gain-of-function experiment using Drosophila Kinesin-5 showed that all L5-directed inhibitors do not allosterically communicate in the same way within the Kinesin-5 motor domain.  A second purpose of mutational studies is to understand how drug resistance in cells is conferred from only changing one residue. These changes in the inhibitor-binding pocket are correlated with structural modification, or twist, of the central beta-sheet of the Kinesin-5 motor domain. In this manner, the L5 loop may be able to directly control nucleotide binding and beta-sheet twist can manipulate the adjacent microtubule-binding site.

It can develop in many chemically distinct compounds. Until now, several mechanisms are known to develop the resistance. The most common is production of so-called \"efflux pumps\". The pumps remove drugs from tumor cells which lead to low drug concentration in the target, below therapeutic level. Efflux is caused by P-glycoprotein called also the multidrug transporter. This protein is a product of multidrug resistance gene MDR1 and a member of family of ATP-dependent transporters (ATP-binding cassette). P-glycoprotein occurs in every organism and serves to protect the body from xenobiotics and is involved in moving nutrients and other biologically important compounds inside one cell or between cells. P-glycoprotein detects substrates when they enter the plasma membrane and bind them which causes activation of one of the ATP-binding domains. The next step is hydrolysis of ATP, which leads to a change in the shape of P-gp and opens a channel through which the drug is pumped out of the cell. Hydrolysis of a second molecule of ATP results in closing of the channel and the cycle is repeated. P-glycoprotein has affinity to hydrophobic drugs with a positive charge or electrically neutral and is often over-expressed in many human cancers. Some tumors, e.g. lung cancer, do not over-express this transporter but also are able to develop the resistance. It was discovered that another transporter MRP1 also work as the efflux pump, but in this case substrates are negatively charged natural compounds or drugs modified by glutathione, conjugation, glycosylation, sulfation and glucuronylation. Drugs can enter into a cell in few kinds of ways. Major routes are: diffusion across the plasma membrane, through receptor or transporter or by the endocytosis process. Cancer can develop the resistance by mutations to their cells which result in alterations in the surface of cells or in impaired endocytosis. Mutation can eliminate or change transporters or receptors which allows drugs to enter into the tumor cell. Other cause of drug resistance is a mutation in \u03b2 tubulin which cause alterations in binding sites and a given drug cannot be bound to its target. Tumors also change expression isoforms of tubulin for these ones, which are not targets for antimitotic drugs e.g. overexpress \u03b2III-tubulin. In addition tumor cells express other kinds of proteins and change microtubule dynamic to counteract effect of anticancer drugs.

ZnPP is known as a competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase. Heme oxygenase is a cytoprotective enzyme that copes with oxidative stress on a cell and shows higher expression in cancerous tissues. ZnPP suppression of heme oxygenase reduces cell viability of cancer cells and increases cytotoxicity in cancer cells. ZnPP works in combination with anticancer drugs to increase cytotoxicity greatly in some cases; results in one study have shown a five-fold increase in treatment efficacy. ZnPP has been shown to have a major role in inhibiting tumor growth especially solid tumors. Tumors from brain cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, oral squamous cell cancer, and leukemia all show a susceptibility to ZnPP due to increase expression of heme oxygenase. The inhibition of heme oxygenase leads to an increase of reactive oxidative species in the cell which sensitizes the cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Increased reactive oxidative species can cause apoptosis in cancer cells and reduce drug resistance when exposed to ZnPP due to loss of the heme oxygenase coping mechanism. The combination of these two therapies is highly effective in treating cancer in experiments thus far, and is a possible new method for overcoming drug resistance. The reduced coping ability of tissues treated with ZnPP also increases radiosensitivity. Cells treated with ZnPP and radiation as opposed to simply one of the two are less viable and more likely to stay in G1 phase of the cell cycle, rather than progress to the G2 phase. ZnPP and radiation combination therapy shows more apoptosis than the same amount of radiation displaying that ZnPP puts stress on cancerous tissue. ZnPP have been injected in a number of trials on solid tumors, but can be utilized more broadly when effectively delivered to cancer cells and not healthy cells. A targeted delivery system is need to fully exploit the uses of ZnPP as a therapeutic agent and heme oxygenase inhibitor due to the potential side effects of free ZnPP on healthy tissue. Reducing the anti-oxidant capability of healthy cells can reduce effects that would have been favorable. However ZnPP have been encapsulated in nanoparticles with specialized coating for drug delivery inside the body. ZnPP did not show any reduce inhibitory potential on heme oxygenase when loaded into nanoparticles. Similarly ZnPP loaded into nanoparticles has a higher cytotoxicity than free ZnPP after two days due to a more favorable release rate as well as better biodistribution and internalization. The possible negative effects on major organs were not seen and blood distribution is more desirable in ZnPP loaded nanoparticles than free ZnPP. The specific inhibition of heme oxygenase using nanoparticles with encapsulated ZnPP reduces side effects and is likely the future method of administering ZnPP treatment.",

Hydrogen bonds between the water molecule, which is linked to Ile50 and Ile50', and carbonyl groups of the peptidomimetic inhibitors seem to connect them with the flap regions. On the other hand, on the nonpeptidic inhibitors, there is a proton acceptor which replaces the tetracoordinated water molecule and interacts directly with the two Ile50 residues on the flap of the enzyme. Specific pockets in the binding site of the HIV protease, often referred to as S1,S1',S2 and S2', recognize hydrophobic amino acids on natural substrates. The potency of inhibitors bearing hydrophobic groups complementing these areas is therefore increased. Some residues in the enzyme binding site are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with hydrophilic groups on the inhibitor, for example with the THF moieties on amprenavir and darunavir.

Hsp90 is exploited by cancer cells to support activated oncoproteins, including many kinases and transcription factors.

Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to the degradation or instability of many of its client proteins. Thus, Hsp90 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy. As with all ATPases, ATP binding and hydrolysis is essential for the chaperoning function of Hsp90 in vivo. Hsp90 inhibitors interfere with this cycle at its early stages by replacing ATP, leading to the regulated ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of most client proteins. As such, the nucleotide binding pocket remains that most amenable to inhibitor generation. To date, there are 23 active Hsp90 inhibitor oncology trials, and 13 HSP90 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in cancer patients, 10 of which have entered the clinic in the past few years. While the N-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket of Hsp90 is most widely studied and thus targeted, recent studies have suggested that a second ATP-binding site is located in the Hsp90 C-terminus. Targeting of this region has resulted in specific reduced Hsp90-hormone interactions and has been shown to influence Hsp90 nucleotide binding. Although none of the C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors have yet to enter the clinic, the use of both N- and C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors in combination represents an exciting new strategy for chemotherapy. Although many of the afore-mentioned inhibitors share the same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), it has been shown that some of these drugs preferentially access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.",
