Murepavadin exhibits a specific and potent bactericidal activity \"in vitro\" against \"P. aeruginosa\" including carbapenemase-producing and colistin-resistant isolates and was shown to be largely inactive against other Gram-negative bacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria. When tested in a large minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) surveillance study, against 1219 contemporary clinical isolates from the USA, Europe, and China of which 28% were MDR strains, murepavadin exhibited a potent antimicrobial activity having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 0.12\u00a0mg/L. There were no significant differences between geographic locations, and there was little difference in activity between MDR/and non-MDR isolates and no cross-resistance was observed with any other antimicrobial tested which supports its novel mechanism of action. Murepavadin showed outstanding \"in vivo\" efficacy in mouse septicemia (ED50 of 0.25 - 0.55\u00a0mg/kg) and lung and thigh infection models. It displays linear pharmacokinetics, is dose proportional with a good penetration into the epithelial lung fluid which underscores its potent \"in vivo\" activity in lung infection models including extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates. In phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers, single doses were well tolerated at plasma concentrations expected to meet or exceed efficacious levels, with no serious adverse events reported. The favorable \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" properties of murepavadin combined with an appropriate safety pharmacology and toxicology profile led to the clinical development of murepavadin for the treatment of serious infections caused by \"P. aeruginosa\". Murepavadin successfully completed phase-II clinical tests in hospital patients with life-threatening \"Pseudomonas\" lung infections and is in phase III development for the treatment of bacterial HAP/ bacterial VAP due to \"P. aeruginosa\" infection.",

It is largely responsible for the inability to eradicate bacterial infections with antibiotic treatment. Persister cells are highly enriched in biofilms, and it has been suggested that this is the reason that makes biofilm-related diseases so hard to treat. Examples are chronic infections of implanted medical devices such as catheters and artificial joints, urinary tract infections, middle ear infections and fatal lung disease .",

Research upon the immune system in the gut and lungs has shown that microflora aids immunity development: however such research has only started upon whether this is the case with the skin. \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" is an example of a mutualistic bacterium that can turn into a pathogen and cause disease: if it gains entry into the blood system it can result in infections in bone, joint, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. It can also cause dermatitis. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces antimicrobial substances such as pseudomonic acid (that are exploited commercially such as Mupirocin). This works against staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa also produces substances that inhibit the growth of fungus species such as \"Candida krusei\", \"Candida albicans\", \"Torulopsis glabrata\", \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and \"Aspergillus fumigatus\". It can also inhibit the growth of \"Helicobacter pylori\". So important is its antimicrobial actions that it has been noted that \"removing \"P. aeruginosa\" from the skin, through use of oral or topical antibiotics, may inversely allow for aberrant yeast colonization and infection.\"",

            "document": "Multidrug tolerance . Multidrug tolerance is caused by a small subpopulation of microbial cells termed persisters. Persisters are not mutants, but rather are dormant cells that can survive the antimicrobial treatments that kill the majority of their genetically identical siblings. Persister cells have entered a non- or extremely slow-growing physiological state which makes them insensitive (refractory or tolerant) to the action of antimicrobial drugs. When such persisting microbial cells cannot be eliminated by the immune system, they become a reservoir from which recurrence of infection will develop. Such non-growing bacteria have been observed to persist within mammalian cells. Indeed, it appears that persister cells are the main cause for relapsing and chronic infections. Chronic infections can affect people of any age, health, or immune status.",

The term broad-spectrum antibiotic can refer to an antibiotic that acts on the two major bacterial groups, gram-positive and gram-negative, or any antibiotic that acts against a wide range of disease-causing bacteria. These medications are used when a bacterial infection is suspected but the group of bacteria is unknown (also called empiric therapy) or when infection with multiple groups of bacteria is suspected. This is in contrast to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, which is effective against only a specific group of bacteria. Although powerful, broad-spectrum antibiotics pose specific risks, particularly the disruption of native, normal bacteria and the development of antimicrobial resistance. An example of a commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic is ampicillin.",
