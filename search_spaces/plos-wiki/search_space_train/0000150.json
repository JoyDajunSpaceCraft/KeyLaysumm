From 1952 W. H. Huang and his team had recorded that taeniasis was highly prevalent in Taiwan under the assumption that \"T. saginata\" was the principal cause. In 1966 S.W. Huang began to suspect that the tapeworm could not be the conventional \"T. saginata\" for the obvious reason that the Taiwan aborigines hardly eat beef, and \"T. saginata\" is strictly a bovine tapeworm. From 1970s studies on the biology began to throw light to its difference from the classical \"T. saginata\". Firstly the tapeworm infects visceral organs such as liver, serosa and lungs of pigs, and liver of cattle; while \"T. saginata\" is known to infect only the muscle of cattle. Secondly there are significant morphological variations though their resemblance is overwhelming. By the early 1990s the morphological and genetic differences were firmly established, but American and Australian parasitologists remained adamant as to its position as a separate biological species. In 1992 two Korean parasitologists Keeseon S. Eom, from Chungbuk National University, and Han-Jong Rim, from Korea University, reported the transmission and larval stages (metacestodes) in naturally infected pigs. They also succeeded in experimentally infecting pigs in which cysticerci were formed in the liver. Further the metacestodes recovered from infected liver were used to infect a human volunteer, whom they had given two years earlier. They therefore proposed the scientific name \"Taenia sagainata taiwanensis.\" They recovered the intact strobilae from the stool after giving the volunteer niclosamide. It was using these metacestodes, strobilae, and adult worms that they gave detailed morphological and anatomical comparisons and concluded it to be a novel species, \"Taenia asiatica\", in 1993. Even then scepticism still persisted. Considering the degree of variations between Taiwan strain and typical \"T. saginata\", Taiwanese parasitologists such as P.C. Fan, C.Y Lin, C.C. Chen and W.C Chung from National Yang-Ming University designated it to a sub-species, and named it \"T. saginata asiatica\". Based on critical assessment on the field reports, experimental infections, morphological and immunological studies available since 1981, they advocated this position. Independent research in Australia also supported the sub-species concept regardless of the genetic variations. But subsequent analyses including epidemiological studies, and phylogenetic analysis using random amplified polymorphic DNA imposed its validity as a distinct species. In 2005 the first complete sequence of its mitochondrial genome was published, and genetic comparison (\"Cox1\"gene) with those of \"Taenia solium\" and \"T. saginata\" provided further support to its taxonomic status. The complete sequence of mitochondrial genome of \"T. saginata\" in 2007, and the development of high-resolution multiplex PCR assay in 2009 finally established beyond doubt that it is indeed a new species.

The debate whether or not \"F. compacta\" is a distinct species of \"Fonsecaea\" has persisted for years, essentially since it was discovered. Some authors maintain that \"F. compacta\" and \"F. pedrosoi\" are separate species given small differences in morphology of conidiophores and conidia. \"F. compacta\" and \"F. pedrosoi\" are readily distinguishable from each other. \"F. compacta\" is characterized by its compact conidial heads, blunt scars and subglobose to ovoid conidia, while \"F. pedrosoi\" has loose conidial heads, prominent scars, and elongated conidia. It was once thought that the two can not be combined into a single species considering there are base substitutions in 48 positions. The two were also found to have identical D1/D2 sequences, a 600 nucleotide domain in a subunit of rDNA. RAPD and RFLP methods were used to investigate genetic variations between these species, however no variations were found. In 2004, scientists from the University of Chiba in Japan found that there is no difference in subunit ribosomal DNA D1/D2 domain sequence between \"F. pedrosoi\" and \"F. compacta\", which may indicate that the latter is merely a morphological variation of the first. More recently, several molecular investigations such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), ITS sequence, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), large subunit (LSU) rRNA D1/D2 domain sequence, and RFLP of small subunit (SSU) rRNA and ITS regions have revealed that \"F. pedrosoi\" and \"F. compacta\" have few distinctions at the molecular level. and accordingly \"F. compacta\" has been considered a morphological variant of \"F. pedrosoi\".",

In addition to the genetic causes of reproductive isolation between species there is another factor that can cause post zygotic isolation: the presence of microorganisms in the cytoplasm of certain species. The presence of these organisms in a species and their absence in another causes the non-viability of the corresponding hybrid. For example, in the semi-species of the group \"D. paulistorum\" the hybrid females are fertile but the males are sterile, this is due to the presence of a \"Wolbachia\" in the cytoplasm which alters spermatogenesis leading to sterility. It is interesting that incompatibility or isolation can also arise at an intraspecific level. Populations of \"D. simulans\" have been studied that show hybrid sterility according to the direction of the cross. The factor determining sterility has been found to be the presence or absence of a microorganism \"Wolbachia\" and the populations tolerance or susceptibility to these organisms. This inter population incompatibility can be eliminated in the laboratory through the administration of a specific antibiotic to kill the microorganism. Similar situations are known in a number of insects, as around 15% of species show infections caused by this symbiont. It has been suggested that, in some cases, the speciation process has taken place because of the incompatibility caused by this bacteria. Two wasp species \"Nasonia giraulti\" and \"N. longicornis\" carry two different strains of \"Wolbachia\". Crosses between an infected population and one free from infection produces a nearly total reproductive isolation between the semi-species. However, if both species are free from the bacteria or both are treated with antibiotics there is no reproductive barrier. \"Wolbachia\" also induces incompatibility due to the weakness of the hybrids in populations of spider mites (\"Tetranychus urticae\"), between \"Drosophila recens\" and \"D. subquinaria\" and between species of \"Diabrotica\" (beetle) and \"Gryllus\" (cricket).",

Visceral Leishmaniasis/kala-azar samples from India revealed the presence of not only the primary causative protozoan parasite, i.e. \"Leishmania donovani\" (LD) but also co-infection with another protozoan member called \"Leptomonas seymouri\" (LS). The latter parasite (LS) further contained a RNA virus known as Leptomonas seymouri narna-like virus 1 (Lepsey NLV1). So, it appears that a great majority of kala-azar victims in the Indian subcontinent are exposed to a RNA virus in LS, the co-infecting parasite with LD i.e. the \"LD-LS-Lepsey NLV1 triple pathogen\" phenomenon.",

The wild species possess many diverse traits including disease resistances and abiotic stress tolerances. The above-mentioned L. nigricans and L. orientalis possess morphological similarities to the cultivated L. culinaris. But only L. culinaris and L. culinaris subsp. orientalis are crossable and produce fully fertile seed. Between the different related species hybradisation barriers exist. According to their inter-crossability Lens species can be divided into three gene pools:  Crosses generally fail between members of different gene pools. However, plant growth regulators and/or embryo rescue allows the growth of viable hybrids between groups. Even if crosses are successful, many undesired genes may be introduced as well in addition to the desired ones. This can be resolved by using a backcrossing programme. Thus, mutagenesis is crucial to create new and desirable varieties. According to Yadav et al. other biotechnology techniques which may impact on lentil breeding are micro-propagation using meristamatic explants, callus culture and regeneration, protoplast culture and doubled haploid production.",

In one study it was shown that two populations of \"P. remota\", one from Cunha in S\u00e3o Paulo state (SP) and the other from Prudent\u00f3polis in Paran\u00e1 state (PR), had several differences in both morphology and behavior. Francisco and his colleagues believe that these differences are caused by the fact that the climate in SP and PR are very distinct. These differences may have caused the selection of different phenotypic characteristics of \"P. remota\" in each region. They observed that colonies from Cunha construct an extra layer of cerumen, or wax, in their nests in the shape of a roof during the reproductive period and that the duration of their diapause is shorter. It has also been observed that the external morphology of the queen's scutellum, the composition of the Dufour's gland secretions of queens and workers, the flight activity of foragers and the regulation of the nest temperature are different between these two populations. What is even more interesting is that during this study that lasted a decade, the two populations were kept in the same place that allowed for genes to be exchanged easily. However, there was no gene flow between the colonies and the high rates of classification indicated that there was no hybridization between the two groups and they maintained their original characteristics.",

These genetically distinct parasites show markedly different patterns of development within the New World sand flies when compared to those seen in the Old World \"Phlebotomus\" sand flies. The first stages of development are similar between all \"Leishmania\" species, with the sandfly taking up the amastigote form of the parasite following a bite of an infected host. However, unlike in the Old World, the replicated parasites then migrate to the hindgut of the \"Lutzomyia\" sand fly, a feature which is thought to be essential in allowing the parasite to become established.

The first written reference to the conspicuous symptoms of cutaneous leishmaniasis surfaced in the Paleotropics within oriental texts dating back to the 7th century BC (allegedly transcribed from sources several hundred years older, between 1500 and 2000 BC). Due to its broad and persistent prevalence throughout antiquity as a mysterious disease of diverse symptomatic outcomes, leishmaniasis has been dubbed with various names ranging from \"white leprosy\" to \"black fever\". Some of these names suggest links to negative cultural beliefs or mythology, which still feed into the social stigmatization of leishmaniasis today. Members of an ancient genus of the \"Leishmania\" parasite, Paleoleishmania, have been detected in fossilized sand flies dating back to the early Cretaceous period, however, the causative agent for the disease was only discovered in 1901 as a concurrent finding by William Boog Leishman and Charles Donovan. They independently visualised microscopic single-celled parasites (later called Leishman-Donovan bodies) living within the cells of infected human organs. The parasitic genus would later be classed as Trypanosomatid protozoans under the phylogenetic designation, \"Leishmania donovani\". Several species have since been classified and grouped under two major subgenera i.e. \"Leishmania Viannia\" (generally located in the Neotropics) or \"Leishmania Leishmania\" (generally located in the Paleotropics, with the major exception of the \"L. mexicana\" subgroup).",
