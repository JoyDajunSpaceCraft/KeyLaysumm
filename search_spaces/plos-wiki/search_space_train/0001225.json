In 2011, the PRRT2 gene on chromosome 16 was identified as the cause of the disease. The researchers looked at the genetics of eight families with strong histories of PKD. They employed whole genome sequencing, along with Sanger sequencing to identify the gene that was mutated in these families. The mutations in this gene included a nonsense mutation identified in the genome of one family and an insertion mutation identified in the genome of another family. The researchers then confirmed this gene as the cause of PKD when it was not mutated in the genome of 1000 control patients. Researchers found PRRT2 mutations in 10 of 29 sporadic cases affected with PKD, thus suggests PRRT2 is the gene mutated in a subset of PKD and PKD is genetically heterogeneous. The mechanism of how PRRT2 causes PKD still requires further investigation. However, researchers suggest it may have to do with PRRT2's expression in the basal ganglia, and the expression of an associated protein, SNAP25, in the basal ganglia as well. The pathophysiology of PKD is not fully explained. A few mechanisms have been suggested thus far: Multiple methods are being used to study the potential brain abnormalities of individuals with PKD compared with \u201cnormal\u201d individuals.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND), and Lou Gehrig's disease, is a specific disease which causes the death of neurons controlling voluntary muscles. Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common. ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size. This results in difficulty speaking, swallowing, and eventually breathing. The cause is not known in 90% to 95% of cases. The remaining 5\u201310% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes. The underlying mechanism involves damage to both upper and lower motor neurons. The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes. No cure for ALS is known. A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months. Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50. The average survival from onset to death is two to four years. About 10% survive longer than 10 years. Most die from respiratory failure. In much of the world, rates of ALS are unknown. In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two to three people per 100,000 per year. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell. In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\". It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide following the 1963 diagnosis of cosmologist Stephen Hawking. In 2014, videos of the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on the Internet and increased public awareness of the condition. ALS is a motor neuron disease, also spelled \"motor neurone disease\", which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy.",

With these conditions motor neurons degenerate leading to eventual paralysis and respiratory failure. Glutamate excitotoxicity is known to contribute to the spread of the sporadic condition. Glutamate levels are increased up 40%, suggesting that activation of glutamate receptors could be the reason for this causing increase Ca influx and then neuronal death. Since decrease nor loss of editing at Q/R site would lead to increase in calcium permeability. In diseased motor neurons editing levels of Glur 2 (62-100%) at this site was discovered to be reduced. Abnormal editing is thought to be specific for this condition, as editing levels have not been found to be decreased in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Q/R editing is not the only mechanism involved, as editing occurs only in spinal motor neurons not in upper spinal neurons. Also, it is unknown whether editing dysregulation is involved in the initiation of the condition, or whether it occurs during pathogenesis.",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND), and Lou Gehrig's disease, is a specific disease which causes the death of neurons controlling voluntary muscles. Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common. ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size. This results in difficulty speaking, swallowing, and eventually breathing. The cause is not known in 90% to 95% of cases. The remaining 5\u201310% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes. The underlying mechanism involves damage to both upper and lower motor neurons. The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes. No cure for ALS is known. A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months. Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50. The average survival from onset to death is two to four years. About 10% survive longer than 10 years. Most die from respiratory failure. In much of the world, rates of ALS are unknown. In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two to three people per 100,000 per year. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell. In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\". It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide following the 1963 diagnosis of cosmologist Stephen Hawking. In 2014, videos of the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on the Internet and increased public awareness of the condition. ALS is a motor neuron disease, also spelled \"motor neurone disease\", which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy.",

Glutamate levels are increased up 40%, suggesting that activation of glutamate receptors could be the reason for this causing increase Ca influx and then neuronal death. Since decrease nor loss of editing at Q/R site would lead to increase in calcium permeability. In diseased motor neurons editing levels of Glur 2 (62-100%) at this site was discovered to be reduced. Abnormal editing is thought to be specific for this condition, as editing levels have not been found to be decreased in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.

The familial ALS is the most studied, however, a new technique that was recently introduced is the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). In this study the researcher can isolate skin fibroblast from a patient with familial or sporadic ALS and reprogram them into motor neuron to study ALS. The main advantage of iPSC is that it allowed researchers to study and understand sALS, and it shows a remarkable contribution in cell based therapy and drug screening. A recent example had used iPSC of patient with SOD-1 dominant mutation and they studied the motor neurons derived from the patient, and they found that the functional genes and the ER stress regulating genes of the mitochondria were reduced in SOD-1 patients, similar to the effect of C9orf72 mutation on the patients.. In addition, some studied showed that iPSC is better than other types of stem cells due to its ability in differentiating into a mature neuron cell, and many other cells too. These iPSC derived cells can be used in transplant cell therapy, in which they can introduce the differentiated cells into the ALS patient to reduce the symptoms without harming the patient .",

Recent research has shown that a mutation in the SOD1 gene is a risk factor for developing degenerative myelopathy in several breeds.

More than 100 SOD1 gene mutations are involved in human familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the pathologic spinal lesions of ALS are similar to those of canine DM, making canine DM a potentially useful animal model of ALS.  Known causes of spinal cord dysfunction should be excluded before accepting the diagnosis of degenerative myelopathy; disc disease (protrusions) or spinal cord tumors can cause compression of the spinal cord with similar signs to degenerative myelopathy.",

ALS is a motor neuron disease involving both the brain and spinal cord, resulting in progressive loss of muscle control. ALS has several contributing causes, but the most common familial form is due to an expanded repeat of the hexanucleotide GGGGCC at the chromosomal locus \"C9ORF72\". The \"C9ORF72\" hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) is capable of binding Pur-alpha very tightly. Pur-alpha may act in ALS directly by binding this DNA repeat expansion or its single-stranded RNA transcript. One potential consequence of this binding would be to influence an unconventional translation of this transcript repeat that results in long dipeptide repeats. This is termed RAN (Repeat Associated Non-ATG) translation initiation. Aberrant Pur-alpha association with its RNA sequence segment may also be a feature of ALS types that do not involve \"C9ORF72\" expansion. Addition of Pur-alpha suppresses neurodegeneration in mouse neuronal cells and in Drosophila expressing the \"C9ORF72\" HRE. Pur-alpha also reverses neuronal changes caused by defects in the gene, \"FUS\", which can lead to ALS. The mechanism of action of Pur-alpha in ALS is not known. There is presently no evidence that the \"PURA\" sequence itself is mutated in the \"C9ORF72\" form of ALS. Rather, it is a regulatory nucleic acid sequence to which Pur-alpha binds that is altered.",

The most studied model for ALS is the rodent, mouse model, which provide the most complex representation of nervous system that is considered the closest in mimicking human nervous system . In this model, the phenotype, and genotype characteristics can be studied and controlled. Many researchers have used transgenic mouse models to study ALS, and one example is the expressing of C9orf72 mutation that can be introduced in mouse using the BAC C9orf72 gene with the multiple repeats of GGGGCC . In that study they chose the bacterial artificial chromosome that has the human length of C9orf72 gene, and they introduced multiple repeats for faster onset of ALS . Also, they have selected for the most stable clone using different conditions, and concluded that the 40 and 500 repeats in the low temperature condition was the most efficient in retaining expansion mutations . Using different BAC C9orf72 transgenic mouse model, they were able to study the symptoms of ALS, such as gait abnormalities, anxiety-like behavior, reduced grip strength, and even death rates . Also, the denervation of motor neurons and dysfunction of neurons can be visualized using fluorescent markers to study the neurodegenerative disorder progression in ALS . Another study also used the SOD1 mutation transgenic mice where they have showed similar signs of ALS that included the axonal and mitochondrial dysfunction and denervation of motor neurons and the reduction of the overall number of neurons in the limbs of the mouse . The TDP-43 transgenic mouse model was also used for ALS studies and it shows similar results to the SOD1 expression, which includes the axon denervation phenotype . For this model which depends on the promoters, they have made many other transgenic mouse models that uses different promoter to compare their phenotype and progression of TDP-43 ALS . Rat models, on the other hand is not very widely used, but their large size can be beneficial in intrathecal injection or mini pump insertion is needed in pharmacological trials. In fact, studied showed that using SOD1 transgenic rat models showed similar development of the genetic and phenotypic traits of the ALS disease .",

Together with other ER stress markers, P4HB is greatly elevated in ALS spinal cord. P4HB can also be nitrosylated, and elevation of nitrosylated P4HB has been shown in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease brain tissue, as well as in transgenic mutant superoxide dismutase 1 mouse and human sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal cord tissues. In addition to neurodegenerative diseases, P4HB level is upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (brain tumor).
