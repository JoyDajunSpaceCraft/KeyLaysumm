These proteins exist and function in a relatively 'disordered' state lacking a stable tertiary structure. As a result, they are difficult to describe in a standard protein structure model that was designed for proteins with a fixed tertiary structure. Conformational ensembles have been devised as a way to provide a more accurate and 'dynamic' representation of the conformational state of intrinsically disordered proteins.

In general, IDPs are characterized by a low content of bulky hydrophobic amino acids and a high proportion of polar and charged amino acids, usually referred to as low hydrophobicity. This property leads to good interactions with water. Furthermore, high net charges promote disorder because of electrostatic repulsion resulting from equally charged residues. Thus disordered sequences cannot sufficiently bury a hydrophobic core to fold into stable globular proteins. In some cases, hydrophobic clusters in disordered sequences provide the clues for identifying the regions that undergo coupled folding and binding (refer to biological roles). Many disordered proteins reveal regions without any regular secondary structure These regions can be termed as flexible, compared to structured loops. While the latter are rigid and contain only one set of Ramachandran angles, IDPs involve multiple sets of angles. The term flexibility is also used for well-structured proteins, but describes a different phenomenon in the context of disordered proteins. Flexibility in structured proteins is bound to an equilibrium state, while it is not so in IDPs.

Changes in the equilibrium constant (K) are used to determine what type of lipid interactions are occurring within the modeled membrane as well as observe liquid-ordered versus liquid-disorder regions. The value of the equilibrium constant determine the following: 1) if monomers are mixed ideally (K = 4.0) 2) when the monomers are mixed homogenously also referred to as an homo-association (K < 4.0) and 3) if the monomers have interchanged heterogeneously which is referred to as an hetero-association ( K > 4.0) A plot of (K) is then created versus the cholesterol mol%. Each plot has similar trends in which the value of the equilibrium constant increased as the mol% increased with and without the presence of ethanol indicating a linear regression. Initially all the model membranes were organized in a liquid order phase but as the addition of cholesterol increase a liquid-disorder phase was observed. The following was determined regarding the liquid-order and liquid-disordered transitions during the addition of cholesterol in the presence of ethanol in each model membrane: 1) 0\u201315\u00a0mol% cholesterol a liquid-disordered phase was present 2) from 15 to 30\u00a0mol% there was a co-existence of both phases and 3) above 27 mole% of cholesterol the model membrane completed converted back to the original liquid-order phase within a two-hour time frame. The linear regression maxed out at 30\u00a0mol% of cholesterol. It's important to mention that ESR studies were also performed that show a coexistence of the liquid-order/liquid-disorder phase from 0 to 8 mole% and as well as 8\u201327\u00a0mol%. The model membrane containing DPPC, cholesterol, and exchanging lipids 1 and 2 show a drastic increase in the linear relationship between (K) versus the mol% of cholesterol. At approximately 8\u00a0mol% of cholesterol the start of the liquid-disordered phase begins. This same relationship is observed in the DSPC, cholesterol, and exchanging lipids 2 and 3 but the start of the liquid-disorder phase occurs at approximately 5.2 mole% with and without the presence of ethanol. Also, there is a higher equilibrium constant value in which the studies relate it to the stronger acyl chain interactions due to this region having longer carbon chains which results in a higher melting point as well. This study not only proves that in the presence of ethanol a reorganization or induced phase change takes place between the cholesterol-phospholipid interaction but that by using higher concentrations of sterol compounds like cholesterol it can hinder the effects of ethanol. The research also suggests that ethanol enhances the association between cholesterol-phospholipids within the liquid-ordered bilayers. The mechanism on how ethanol induces the liquid-disorder phase as well as enhances the cholesterol-phospholipid association is still not understood. The researchers have mentioned that part of the liquid-disorder formation occurs possibly be interrupting the hydrophobic region of the phospholipids, by binding closely towards the hydrophilic region of the phospholipid, and acting as \"filler\" since ethanol cannot closely align with the neighboring phospholipids. All of these possible mechanisms can be contributed to ethanol's amphiphilic nature.",

In opposition to the Dodo bird verdict, there are a growing number of studies demonstrating that some treatments produce better outcomes for particular disorders when compared to other treatments. Here, in contrast to the common factor theory, specific components of the therapy have shown predictive power. The most compelling evidence against the Dodo bird verdict is illustrated by the research done on anxiety disorders. Many studies have found specific treatment modalities to be beneficial when treating anxiety disorders, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT uses techniques from both cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy to modify maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. Numerous meta-analyses have shown that CBT yields significantly superior results in the treatment of psychological disorders, most notably, anxiety disorders. However, CBT also plays a positive role in treating depression, eating disorders, substance abuse disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In meta-analytic reviews, there is generally a larger effect size when CBT is used to treat anxiety disorders. Recent studies show that when treating generalized anxiety disorder, CBT generated an effect size of 0.51, which indicates a medium effect. That is a much larger effect compared to supportive therapy and other treatments. Similarly, when treating social anxiety disorder, CBT produced an effect size of 0.62, which again supports the evidence that CBT does in fact yield significantly better results than other therapies. Those supporting the Dodo bird verdict often use meta-analyses to compare multiple evidence supported treatments (ESTs) in order to illustrate that these treatments have no really significant differences. Because these treatments are already proven to work, comparing them to each other does show little variation. However psychology is made up of more therapies than just ESTs. When comparing a therapy like CBT to a treatment that does not meet EST criteria, the difference in effect size is obvious. Research showing differences among different treatments for specific disorders is now reflected in the latest EST guidelines. ESTs are developed from multiple control trial tests to evaluate which therapies yield the best results for specific disorders. These disorders include, but are not limited to, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and OCD. According to the Ethics Code of the American Psychological Association (APA), psychologists and therapists have an obligation to avoid harming their clients in any way. ESTs are a major component in this movement. By using specific therapies clinically proven to improve certain disorders, therapists are avoiding further damage to their patients. However, supporting the idea of ESTs inevitably implies that some therapies are in fact more efficacious than others for particular disorders.",

Often, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation tune the affinity (not rarely by several orders of magnitude) of individual linear motifs for specific interactions.

In part, this growing interest is a result of their general importance in protein science, but also because allosteric residues may be exploited in biomedical contexts.

In his PhD thesis, Changeux suggested that the recognition and transmission of signals by membrane, and in particular by synapses, could use the same mechanisms as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. More than forty years of research would follow, mainly focussed on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). In 1967, Changeux extended the MWC model to bi-dimensional lattice of receptors (an idea that would also be developed three decades afterward by Dennis Bray). He then applied this idea to the post-synaptic membrane of electric organs (analog to striated muscle). His team demonstrated the existence of several interconvertible states for the nicotinic receptor, resting, open and desensitized, displaying different affinities for the ligands, such as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine. The transitions between the states followed different kinetics, and those kinetics plus the differential affinities sufficed to explain the shape of the post-synaptic potential. A full mechanistic model of the nicotinic receptor from striated muscle (or electric organ) was to be provided much later, when Changeux collaborated with Stuart Edelstein, another specialist of allostery, who worked decades on hemoglobin. In addition to the allosteric modulation of the channel gating by the agonists, many other regulations of the ligand-gated ion channels activity have since been discovered. The modulators bind to a variety of allosteric sites, whether on the agonist binding sites, other binding sites at the subunit interfaces, on the cytoplasmic part of the protein or in the transmembrane domain.",

The Gaussian network model (GNM) is a representation of a biological macromolecule as an elastic mass-and-spring network to study, understand, and characterize the mechanical aspects of its long-time large-scale dynamics. The model has a wide range of applications from small proteins such as enzymes composed of a single domain, to large macromolecular assemblies such as a ribosome or a viral capsid. Protein domain dynamics plays key roles in a multitude of molecular recognition and cell signalling processes. Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered flexible linker domains, induce long-range allostery via . The resultant dynamic modes cannot be generally predicted from static structures of either the entire protein or individual domains.",

            "document": "Catch bond . Though catch bonds are now widely recognized, their mechanism of action is still under dispute. Two leading hypotheses dominate the discussion. The first hypothesis, the allosteric model, stems from evidence that x-ray crystallography of selectin proteins shows two conformational states: a bent conformation in the absence of ligand, and an extended conformation in the presence of the ligand. The main domains involved in these states are a lectin domain which contains the ligand binding site and an EGF domain which can shift between bent and extended conformations. The allosteric model claims that tension on the EGF domain favors the extended conformation, and extension of this domain causes a conformational shift in the lectin domain, resulting in greater binding affinity for the ligand. As a result of this conformational change, the ligand is effectively locked in place despite tension exerted on the bond.",
