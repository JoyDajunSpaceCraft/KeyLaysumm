            "document": "Lyme disease . Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the \"Borrelia\" type which is spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that begins at the site of a tick bite about a week after it has occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25\u201350% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months. Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks of the genus \"Ixodes\". Usually, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours before the bacteria can spread. In North America, \"Borrelia burgdorferi\" and \"Borrelia mayonii\" are the cause. In Europe and Asia, the bacteria \"Borrelia afzelii\" and \"Borrelia garinii\" are also causes of the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals, or through food. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. Prevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites such as by wearing long pants and using DEET. Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. Ticks can be removed using tweezers. If the removed tick was full of blood, a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent development of infection, but is not generally recommended since development of infection is rare. If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment which may last for one or two days. In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. Lyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. It is estimated to affect 300,000 people a year in the United States and 65,000 people a year in Europe. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Old Lyme, Connecticut. It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer. Chronic symptoms following treatment are well described and are known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). PTLDS is different to chronic Lyme disease; a no longer supported term used in different ways by different groups. Some healthcare providers claim that it is due to ongoing infection; however, this is not believed to be true, due to the inability to detect infectious organisms after standard treatment. A Lyme vaccine was marketed in the US between 1998 and 2002; it was withdrawn from the market due to poor sales, originally due to lack of reimbursement by insurance companies and then due to rumors about adverse effects. Research is ongoing to develop new vaccines.",

            "document": "Proteases in angiogenesis . Numerous proteolytic fragments or domains of ECM proteins have been reported to exert positive or negative activity on angiogenesis. Native proteins which contain such domains with regulatory activity are normally inactive, most likely because they are cryptic segments hidden in the native protein structure. Angiostatin is a 38\u00a0kDa plasminogen fragment with angiogenesis inhibitor activity. Angiostatin fragments contain kringle domains which exert their inhibitory activity at several different levels; they inhibit endothelial cell migration and proliferation, increase apoptosis, and modulate the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Endostatin is a 20\u00a0kDa fragment of collagen XVIII. The major role of endostatin is in its ability to potently inhibit endothelial cell migration and induce apoptosis. These effects are mediated by interacting and interfering with various angiogenic related proteins such as integrins and serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. Numerous studies have demonstrated that tropoelastin, the soluble precursor of elastin, or proteolytic elastin fragments have diverse biological properties. Nackman et al. demonstrated that elastase generated elastin fragments mediate several characteristic features of aneurismal disease which correlated to angiogenesis. Osteonectin is a metal binding glycoprotein produced by many cell types including ECs. Lastly, endorepellin is a recently described inhibitor of angiogenesis derived from the carboxy terminus of perlecan. Nanomolar concentrations of endorepellin inhibits EC migration and angiogenesis in different \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" models by blocking EC adhesion to various substrate such as fibronectin and type I collagen.",
