KaiC encodes for the KaiC protein which interacts with the KaiA and KaiB proteins in a post-translational oscillator (PTO). The PTO is cyanobacteria master clock that is controlled by sequences of phosphorylation of KaiC protein. Regulation of KaiABC expression and KaiABC phosphorylation is essential for cyanobacteria circadian rhythmicity, and is particularly important for regulating cyanobacteria processes such as nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, and cell division. Studies have shown similarities to Drosophila, Neurospora, and mammalian clock models in that the kaiABC regulation of the cyanobacteria slave circadian clock is also based on a transcription translation feedback loop (TTFL). KaiC protein has both auto-kinase and auto-phosphatase activity and acts as the circadian regulator in both the PTO and the TTFL. KaiC has been found to not only suppress kaiBC when overexpressed, but also suppress circadian expression of all genes in the cyanobacterial genome.",

The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in regulation of flowering time genes. When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop. Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early morning, whereas TOC1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop.

Two models have been proposed to describe the relationship between the biochemical and TTFL regulation of circadian rhythms: a master/slave oscillator system with the TTFL oscillator synchronizing to the biochemical oscillator and an equally weighted coupled oscillator system in which both oscillators synchronize and influence the other oscillator. Both are coupled oscillator models that account for the high stability of the timing mechanism within \"Synechococcus\". The biochemical oscillator relies on redundant molecular interactions based on the law of mass action, whereas the TTFL relies on cellular machinery that mediates translation, transcription, and degradation of mRNA and proteins.

This CYC-CLK protein complex binds to E-box elements in promoter regions of the genes period and timeless, functioning as a transcription factor in the translation of the proteins PER and TIM. After the PER and TIM proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm and bind together, the PER-TIM complex translocates to the nucleus. The TIM protein in these complexes mediate the accumulation of the dimeric PER-TIM protein complex and their subsequent importation into the nucleus, where the PER protein in these complexes then mediates the release of CYC-CLK from the chromatin, repressing CYC-CLK dependent transcription. Thus, CLK and CYC act as positive factors and PER and TIM as negative factors. CYC also plays a role in the post-translational regulation of CLK in the cytoplasm. These four proteins of the feedback loop are later degraded by a casein kinase-mediated phosphorylation cycle, allowing fluctuations in gene expression according to environmental cues. This cycle is called the transcription-translation feedback loop as demonstrated in this video by the Howard Hughes Medical Institution.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.

After translation, the CCA1 protein needs to be phosphorylated by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2). This phosphorylation is necessary for the protein to form a homodimer and to bind to its target promoters. Hyperphosphorylation, due to the overexpression of CK2, will lead to altered circadian rhythms in the mutants where CCA1 showed shorter mRNA circadian oscillation than in wild-type plants. CK2 overexpression is significant in demonstrating CCA1 is part of the clock. The protein motif CCA1 uses to bind to its target DNA sequences is its Myb-like domain. CCA1 only has one Myb domain, whereas other plant and mammalian proteins could have multiple Myb domains. The presence of only one Myb domain in CCA1 shows its importance influence in the circadian clock. LUX is also an important Myb transcription factor that is necessary for CCA/LHY transcription.

KaiA mutant periods ranged up to 50h in which some mutants demonstrated arrythmicity. KaiA mutations seem to selectively alter period length demonstrating that kaiA can regulate period.  Further, kaiA proteins can regulate the length of a period of the circadian oscillation regardless of whether kaiBC was activated or not . Long periods were caused by mutation within kaiA as well as the lowering of kaiBC expression.",

At first, the cyanobacterial clockwork appeared to be a transcription and translation feedback loop in which clock proteins autoregulate the activity of their own promoters by a process that was similar in concept to the circadian clock loops of eukaryotes. Subsequently, however, several lines of evidence indicated that transcription and translation was not necessary for circadian rhythms of Kai proteins, the most spectacular being that the three purified Kai proteins can reconstitute a temperature-compensated circadian oscillation in a test tube. The rhythm that is measurable in vitro is the phosphorylation status of the clock protein KaiC. This is the first (and so far, only) example of the reconstitution of a circadian clock in vitro.",

Takao Kondo and Susan Golden used bacterial luciferase, a reporter for gene expression, on the gene \"psbAI\" to monitor the activity of this clock gene found in \"Synechococcus\" cyanobacteria. The transformation of a 44 hour long-period clock mutant, \"C44a\", with wild-type (WT) genomic DNA library in a plasmid vector allowed testing for \u201crescue clones\u201d with a normal period of 25 hours. When the DNA library from this rescued clone was placed into a plasmid at the original site, \"C44a\" was found to be completely rescued. One single gene cluster, \"kaiABC\", was found to be rhythmic in nature when the fragment of the plasmid responsible for rescue was sequenced. \"kaiABC\" is composed of three individual genes: \"kaiA\", \"kaiB\", and \"kaiC\". Examination of rescue patterns in over 50 clock mutants showing either short periods, long periods or arrhythmia revealed restoration to WT phenotype in all mutants.  Further sequencing revealed 19 total \"kaiABC\" specific mutants, 14 of which had mutations in \"kaiC\", 3 in \"kaiA\", and 2 in \"kaiB\". The mutant phenotypes being all caused by a single amino acid substitution on one of the aforementioned genes determined that Kai proteins play a significant role in the \"Synechococcus\" circadian clock.",

Protein KaiA enhances the phosphorylation of protein KaiC by binding to the A loop of the CII domain to promote auto-kinase activity during subjective day. Phosphorylation at subunits occurs in an ordered manner, beginning with phosphorylation of Threonine 432 (T432) followed by Serine 431 (S431) on the CII domain. This leads to tight stacking of the CII domain to the CI domain. KaiB then binds to the exposed B loop on the CII domain of KaiC and sequesters KaiA from the C-terminals during subjective night, which inhibits phosphorylation and stimulates auto-phosphatase activity. Dephosphorylation of T432 occurs followed by S431, returning KaiC to its original state.",

The recreation of a circadian oscillator \"in vitro\" in the presence of only KaiA, KaiB, KaiC, and ATP has sparked interest in the relationship between cellular biochemical oscillators and their associated transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs). TTFLs have long been assumed to be the core of circadian rhythmicity, but that claim is now being tested again due to the possibility that the biochemical oscillators could constitute the central mechanism of the clock system, regulating and operating within TTFLs that control output and restore proteins essential to the oscillators in organisms, such as the KaiABC system in \"Synechococcus\". Two models have been proposed to describe the relationship between the biochemical and TTFL regulation of circadian rhythms: a master/slave oscillator system with the TTFL oscillator synchronizing to the biochemical oscillator and an equally weighted coupled oscillator system in which both oscillators synchronize and influence the other oscillator. Both are coupled oscillator models that account for the high stability of the timing mechanism within \"Synechococcus\". The biochemical oscillator relies on redundant molecular interactions based on the law of mass action, whereas the TTFL relies on cellular machinery that mediates translation, transcription, and degradation of mRNA and proteins. The different types of interactions driving the two oscillators allows the circadian clock to be resilient to changes within the cell, such as metabolic fluctuation, temperature changes, and cell division.",

KaiC acts as a non-specific transcription regulator that represses transcription of the \"kaiBC\" promoter. Its crystal structure has been solved at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution; it is a homohexameric complex (approximately 360 kDa) with a double-doughnut structure and a central pore which is open at the N-terminal ends and partially sealed at the C-terminal ends due to the presence of six arginine residues. The hexamer has twelve ATP molecules between the N- (CI) and C-terminal (CII) domains, which demonstrate ATPase activity. The CI and CII domains are linked by the N-terminal region of the CII domain. The last 20 residues from the C-terminal of the CII domain protrude from the doughnut to form what is called the A-loop. Interfaces on KaiC's CII domain are sites for both auto-kinase and auto-phosphatase activity, both \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\".
