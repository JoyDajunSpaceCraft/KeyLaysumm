PcG proteins repress genes by forming polycomb repressive complexes, such as PRC1 and PRC2.

Furthermore, Ring1B, a member of the PRC1 complex, also represses Hox genes with Me118, Mph2, and RYBP by compacting the chromatin into higher-order structures. TrxG genes, meanwhile, are responsible for activating genes by trimethylating lysine 4 of the histone H3 tail.

Analysis of the spread of X chromosome inactivation into autosomal material in one study showed that genes that were subject to (or escaped from) X chromosome inactivation clustered within topologically associating domains, and these genes were more likely to be found in regions that have PRC2 and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation marks normally on non-rearranged chromosomes. MACROH2A is a replacement for histone H2A that also supports heterochromatin formation. In particular, one subtype of MACROH2A, macroH2A1.2, is concentrated in the inactive X chromosome in adult females.

The ARID domain of Jarid2 binds directly to DNA enriched in GC and GA dinucleotides, whereas the Tudor domain of Pcl proteins recognizes methylated H3K36, a histone mark that is associated with transcriptional elongation. This suggests that the Pcl family of proteins facilitates PcG-mediated silencing of previously active genes.

In Drosophila, long ncRNAs induce the expression of the homeotic gene, Ubx, by recruiting and directing the chromatin modifying functions of the trithorax protein Ash1 to Hox regulatory elements. Similar models have been proposed in mammals, where strong epigenetic mechanisms are thought to underlie the embryonic expression profiles of the Hox genes that persist throughout human development. Indeed, the human Hox genes are associated with hundreds of ncRNAs that are sequentially expressed along both the spatial and temporal axes of human development and define chromatin domains of differential histone methylation and RNA polymerase accessibility. One ncRNA, termed HOTAIR, that originates from the HOXC locus represses transcription across 40 kb of the HOXD locus by altering chromatin trimethylation state. HOTAIR is thought to achieve this by directing the action of Polycomb chromatin remodeling complexes in trans to govern the cells' epigenetic state and subsequent gene expression. Components of the Polycomb complex, including Suz12, EZH2 and EED, contain RNA binding domains that may potentially bind HOTAIR and probably other similar ncRNAs. This example nicely illustrates a broader theme whereby ncRNAs recruit the function of a generic suite of chromatin modifying proteins to specific genomic loci, underscoring the complexity of recently published genomic maps. Indeed, the prevalence of long ncRNAs associated with protein coding genes may contribute to localised patterns of chromatin modifications that regulate gene expression during development. For example, the majority of protein-coding genes have antisense partners, including many tumour suppressor genes that are frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in cancer. A recent study observed an inverse expression profile of the p15 gene and an antisense ncRNA in leukaemia. A detailed analysis showed the p15 antisense ncRNA (CDKN2BAS) was able to induce changes to heterochromatin and DNA methylation status of p15 by an unknown mechanism, thereby regulating p15 expression. Therefore, misexpression of the associated antisense ncRNAs may subsequently silence the tumour suppressor gene contributing towards cancer.",

Whether Xist directly recruits Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the chromatin or this recruitment is the consequence of Xist-mediated changes on the chromatin has been object of intense debate. Some studies showed that PRC2 components are not associated with Xist RNA or do not interact functionally. However another study has shown by means of mass spectrometry analysis, that two subunits of PRC2 may interact with Xist, although these proteins are also found in other complexes and are not unique components of the PRC2 complex.",

The roles of these respective modifications are not as well characterised as tri-methylation. PCR2 is however believed to be implicated in all the different methylations associated with H3K27me.  H3K27me1 is linked to promotion of transcription and is seen to accumulate in transcribed genes. Histone-histone interactions play a role in this process. Regulation occurs via Setd2-dependent H3K36me3 deposition. H3K27me2 is broadly distributed within the core histone H3 and is believed to play a protective role by inhibiting non-cell-type specific enhancers. Ultimately, this leads to the inactivation of transcription. Acetylation is usually linked to the upregulation of genes. This is the case in H3K27ac which is an active enhancer mark. It is found in distal and proximal regions of genes. It is enriched in Transcriptional start sites (TSS). H3K27ac shares a location with H3K27me3 and they interact in an antagonistic manner.  H3K27me3 is often seen to interact with H3K4me3 in bivalent domains . These domains are usually found in embryonic stem cells and are pivotal for proper cell differentiation. H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 determine whether a cell will remain unspecified or will eventually differentiate. The Grb10 gene in mice makes use of these bivalent domains. Grb10 displays imprinted gene expression. Genes are expressed from one parental allele while simultaneously being silenced in the other parental allele.  Other well characterised modifications are H3K9me3 as well as H4K20me3 which\u2014just like H3K27me3\u2014are linked to transcriptional repression via formation of heterochromatic regions.

The most comprehensive study which was published in 2003, identified mice orthologue of human JADE1, Jade1, and investigated Jade1 expression during mice embryogenesis. Searching for developmentally regulated genes the authors used gene trap screen analysis and identified mouse Jade1 as gene strongly regulated during embryogenesis. Insertion of the vector into the third intron of the Jade1 gene lead to the production of a 47-amino-acid truncated protein. The gene trap insertional mutation resulted in Jade1-beta-galactosidase reporter fusion product and Jade1 null allele. While the homozygotes for the gene trap integration did not produce strong developmental phenotype, the fusion product revealed Jade1 gene spatial-temporal expression in mouse embryonic cells and tissues of developing embryo up to 15.5-d.p.c. In addition the study reports experimental and in silico comparative analysis of Jade1 mRNA transcripts, Jade1 gene structure and analysis of Jade1 protein orthologues from mouse human and zebra fish. Jade1 expression was detected in extraembryonic ectoderm and trophoblast, which are placental components important for vasculogenesis, as well as in sites enriched with multipotent or tissue-specific progenitors, including neural progenitors(2). The dynamics of Jade1 reporter expression in these areas indicates the involvement in the determination and elongation of anterior posterior axis, an important point of the study). The potential role for human JADE1 in the renewal of embryonic stem cell and embryonal carcinoma cell cultures was suggested in another screening study which showed that, in cultured stem cells activation of stem cell transcription factor OCT4 pathway upregulated JADE1 gene expression along with stem cell factors NANOG, PHC1, USP44 and SOX2. Role of JADE1 in epithelial cell proliferation was addressed in a murine model of acute kidney injury and regeneration. Expression patterns and dynamics of HBO1-JADE1S/L were examined in regenerating tubular epithelial cells. Ischemia and reperfusion injury resulted in an initial decrease in JADE1S, JADE1L, and HBO1 protein levels, which returned to the baseline during renal recovery. Expression levels of HBO1 and JADE1S recovered as cell proliferation rate reached maximum, whereas JADE1L recovered after bulk proliferation had diminished. The temporal expression of JADE1 correlated with the acetylation of histone H4 (H4K5 and H4K12) but not that of histone H3 (H4K14), suggesting that the JADE1-HBO1 complex specifically marks H4 during epithelial cell proliferation. The results of the study implicate JADE1-HBO1 complex in acute kidney injury and suggest distinct roles for JADE1 isoforms during epithelial cell recovery.",

The ARID domain of Jarid2 binds directly to DNA enriched in GC and GA dinucleotides, whereas the Tudor domain of Pcl proteins recognizes methylated H3K36, a histone mark that is associated with transcriptional elongation.

Whether Xist directly recruits Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the chromatin or this recruitment is the consequence of Xist-mediated changes on the chromatin has been object of intense debate. Some studies showed that PRC2 components are not associated with Xist RNA or do not interact functionally. However another study has shown by means of mass spectrometry analysis, that two subunits of PRC2 may interact with Xist, although these proteins are also found in other complexes and are not unique components of the PRC2 complex.",

H3K4me3 is commonly associated with the activation of transcription of nearby genes. H3K4 trimethylation regulates gene expression through chromatin remodeling by the NURF complex. In bivalent chromatin, H3K4me3 is co-localized with the repressive modification H3K27me3 to control gene regulation. H3K4me3 also plays an important role in the genetic regulation of stem cell potency and lineage.",

Though PRC1 isn't as well-studied as PRC2, Bmi-1 has had a great deal of focus for its involvement in numerous cancers. It has been found to regulate cell senescence and proliferation through repressing cell cycle regulating genes such as p16 and p19 (sometimes referred to as Ink4A/Arf locus). Normally, this function allows it to assist stem cells in maintaining their self-renewing capacity. However, modulation of these cell cycle inhibitor genes also allows Bmi-1 to malignantly transform cells (both mature and stem cells) into cancer stem cells. Bmi-1 is thus considered an oncogene. Expression of Bmi-1 has been found to be elevated or otherwise deregulated in numerous cancer types including squamous cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, bladder tumors and leukemia. Since it is known to be associated with metastasis and malignant transformation, Bmi-1 makes for a good marker of cancer and may hold prognostic or diagnostic value. Silencing Bmi-1 has shown to enhance activity of chemotherapeutic agents, and it is known for its association with chemoresistance to common chemotherapeutics. For example, one study has demonstrated that reduction of Bmi-1 is capable of restoring sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug Gemcitabine. Researchers found that Bmi-1 ubiquitinates ribonucleotide reductase M1 RRM1 for degradation. Gemcitabine binds to RRM1 and irreversibly inactivates ribonucleotide reductase, ultimately preventing the synthesis of DNA. Thus, the chemotherapeutic Gemcitabine needs to bind to RRM1 to prevent cancer cells from replicating and/or repairing their DNA.",

PRC1 is involved in the maintenance of gene repression; it carries out this function by binding to a trimethylated lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) and subsequently marking lysine 119 of histone H2A with a single ubiquitin group (H2AK119ub). The Drosophila PRC1 core complex is formed by the Polycomb (Pc), Polyhomeotic (Ph), Posterior sex combs (Psc), and Sex combs extra (Sce, also known as Ring) subunits. In mammals, the composition of PRC1 is much more diverse and varies depending on the cellular context. All PRC1 complexes contain homologs of the Drosophila Ring protein. Ring1A and Ring1B (which are also known as Rnf1 and Rnf2, respectively) are E3 ubiquitin ligases that mark lysine 119 of histone H2A with a single ubiquitin group (H2AK119ub). Mammalian homologs of the Drosophila Psc protein, such as Mel18 (Pcgf2) or Bmi-1 (Pcgf4), regulate PRC1 enzymatic activity. PRC1 complexes can be divided into at least two classes according to the presence or absence of Cbx proteins, which are homologs of Drosophila Pc. Canonical PRC1 complexes contain Cbx proteins that recognize and bind H3K27me3, the mark deposited by PRC2. Therefore, canonical PRC1 complexes and PRC2 can act together to repress gene transcription and maintain this repression through cell division (i.e. the repressed state is also present in daughter cells). Non-canonical PRC1 complexes, which contain Rybp (together with additional proteins, such as L3mbtl2 or Kdm2b) rather than the Cbx proteins have recently been described in mammals.",

In Drosophila, long ncRNAs induce the expression of the homeotic gene, Ubx, by recruiting and directing the chromatin modifying functions of the trithorax protein Ash1 to Hox regulatory elements. Similar models have been proposed in mammals, where strong epigenetic mechanisms are thought to underlie the embryonic expression profiles of the Hox genes that persist throughout human development. Indeed, the human Hox genes are associated with hundreds of ncRNAs that are sequentially expressed along both the spatial and temporal axes of human development and define chromatin domains of differential histone methylation and RNA polymerase accessibility. One ncRNA, termed HOTAIR, that originates from the HOXC locus represses transcription across 40 kb of the HOXD locus by altering chromatin trimethylation state. HOTAIR is thought to achieve this by directing the action of Polycomb chromatin remodeling complexes in trans to govern the cells' epigenetic state and subsequent gene expression. Components of the Polycomb complex, including Suz12, EZH2 and EED, contain RNA binding domains that may potentially bind HOTAIR and probably other similar ncRNAs. This example nicely illustrates a broader theme whereby ncRNAs recruit the function of a generic suite of chromatin modifying proteins to specific genomic loci, underscoring the complexity of recently published genomic maps. Indeed, the prevalence of long ncRNAs associated with protein coding genes may contribute to localised patterns of chromatin modifications that regulate gene expression during development. For example, the majority of protein-coding genes have antisense partners, including many tumour suppressor genes that are frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in cancer. A recent study observed an inverse expression profile of the p15 gene and an antisense ncRNA in leukaemia. A detailed analysis showed the p15 antisense ncRNA (CDKN2BAS) was able to induce changes to heterochromatin and DNA methylation status of p15 by an unknown mechanism, thereby regulating p15 expression. Therefore, misexpression of the associated antisense ncRNAs may subsequently silence the tumour suppressor gene contributing towards cancer.",
