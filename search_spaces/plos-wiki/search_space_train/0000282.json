In higher eukaryotes with dimorphic sex chromosomes, such as humans and fruit flies, males have one X chromosome, whereas females have two. These organisms have evolved a mechanism that compensates not only for the different number of sex chromosomes between the two sexes, but also for the differing X/autosome ratios. In this genome-wide survey, the scientists found that autosomal genes are more likely to undergo nonsense-mediated decay than X-linked genes. This is because NMD fine tunes X chromosomes and it was demonstrated by inhibiting the pathway. The results were that balanced gene expression between X and autosomes gene expression was decreased by 10\u201315% no matter the method of inhibition. The NMD pathway is skewed towards depressing expression of larger population or autosomal genes than x-linked ones. In conclusion, the data supports the view that the coupling of alternative splicing and NMD is a pervasive means of gene expression regulation.",

Human females are typically XX; males are typically XY. The remaining pairs of chromosome are found in both sexes and are called autosomes; genetic traits due to loci on these chromosomes are described as autosomal, and may be dominant or recessive. Genetic traits on the X and Y chromosomes are called sex-linked, because they are linked to sex chromosomes, not because they are characteristic of one sex or the other. In practice, the term almost always refers to X-linked traits and a great many such traits (such as red-green colour vision deficiency) are not affected by sex. Females have two copies of every gene locus found on the X chromosome, just as for the autosomes, and the same dominance relationships apply. Males however have only one copy of each X chromosome gene locus, and are described as hemizygous for these genes. The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X, and contains a much smaller set of genes, including, but not limited to, those that influence 'maleness', such as the SRY gene for testis determining factor. Dominance rules for sex-linked gene loci are determined by their behavior in the female: because the male has only one allele (except in the case of certain types of Y chromosome aneuploidy), that allele is always expressed regardless of whether it is dominant or recessive.",

X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies.\u00a0 Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called \"sex-lethal\". The gene was named \"sex-lethal\" due to its mutant phenotype which has little to no effect on male flies but results in the death of females due to X hyperactivation of the two X chromosomes. In female \"Drosophila\", the sex-lethal protein causes the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\"gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. This produces a positive feedback loop as the sex-lethal protein splices the \"sex-lethal\" gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. In male \"Drosophila\", there isn\u2019t enough sex-lethal to activate the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\" gene, and it goes through the \"default\" splicing. This means that section of the gene that is spliced out in females remains in males. This portion contains an early stop codon resulting in no protein being made from it. In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the \"male-specific lethal\" (\"msl\") gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The \"msl\" gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the \"msl\" gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the expression of the X chromosome to be \"doubled,\" or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes.",

Because the entire genome of the platypus has yet to be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.",

More recently, Meyer\u2019s lab has shown that proteins known as X-linked signal elements (XSEs) operate in concert with SDC-2 to differentially repress and activate other genes in the dosage compensation pathway. By selectively mutating a panel of genes hypothesized to contribute to dosage compensation in worms, Meyer\u2019s group demonstrated which XSEs specifically play a role in determining normal dosage compensation. They found that during embryonic development, several X-linked genes\u2014including sex-1, sex-2, fox-1, and ceh-39\u2014act in a combinatorial fashion to selectively repress transcriptional activity of the xol-1 gene in hermaphrodites.

In fact, xol-1 is often referred to in the literature as the master sex regulatory gene of C. elegans. XX C. elegans embryos have much lower xol-1 expression than their XO counterparts, resulting from overall increases in the amount of SEX-1, SEX-2, CEH-39, and FOX-1 transcription produced in the female embryos. This consequent decrease in xol-1 expression then allows higher SDC-2 expression levels, which aids in the formation and function of the DCC complex in the XX hermaphroditic worms, and in turn results in equalized expression of X-linked genes in the hermaphrodite.",

X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies.\u00a0 Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called \"sex-lethal\". The gene was named \"sex-lethal\" due to its mutant phenotype which has little to no effect on male flies but results in the death of females due to X hyperactivation of the two X chromosomes. In female \"Drosophila\", the sex-lethal protein causes the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\"gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. This produces a positive feedback loop as the sex-lethal protein splices the \"sex-lethal\" gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. In male \"Drosophila\", there isn\u2019t enough sex-lethal to activate the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\" gene, and it goes through the \"default\" splicing. This means that section of the gene that is spliced out in females remains in males. This portion contains an early stop codon resulting in no protein being made from it. In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the \"male-specific lethal\" (\"msl\") gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The \"msl\" gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the \"msl\" gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the expression of the X chromosome to be \"doubled,\" or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes.",

Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans.

In organisms that use this method of dosage compensation, the presence of one or more X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate dosage compensation mechanisms is lethal. Male specific lethal proteins (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name \u201cMSL\u201d is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male \"Drosophila\". The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family\u2014maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3\u2014are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread along the length of the chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. The implications of this spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.",

This selection of one X chromosome can vary between tissue types, as it depends on the specific gene and its activity in the tissue, with rapidly dividing cells giving selection processes more time to work. Blood cells, for example, tend to have the highest rates of skewing due to the extremely high dividing and replacement rate within the human body. The strength of selection can also vary depending on the gene under selection, and so skewing can occur at different rates and to different extents. Secondary selection tends to cause an increase in skewing with age. This is primarily due to a longer span over which selective pressure has room in which to act.

People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Females typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY). 48,XXYY syndrome results from the presence of an extra copy of both sex chromosomes in each of a male's cells (48,XXYY). Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome interfere with male sexual development, preventing the testes from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Many genes are found only on the X or Y chromosome, but genes in areas known as the pseudoautosomal regions are present on both sex chromosomes. Extra copies of genes from the pseudoautosomal regions of the extra X and Y chromosome contribute to the signs and symptoms of 48,XXYY syndrome; however, the specific genes have not been identified.  The condition 48,XXYY is not inherited; it usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. In 48,XXYY syndrome, the extra sex chromosomes almost always come from a sperm cell. Nondisjunction may cause a sperm cell to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a sperm cell with three sex chromosomes (one X and two Y chromosomes). If that sperm cell fertilizes a normal egg cell with one X chromosome, the resulting child will have two X chromosomes and two Y chromosomes in each of his body's cells.",

In 1965, Stanley Gartler and David Linder were able to demonstrate clonality of tumors in human females using an event (X chromosome inactivation) that occurs early in development in mammalian females. X chromosome inactivation randomly silences most of the genes on one of the two X chromosomes in every cell of the embryo. The female thus becomes a mosaic for any X-linked gene for which she is heterozygous, and normal tissues are therefore composed of a nearly equal mixture of cells expressing the two different phenotypes. However, if a tumor begins from a single cell, then all the cells of the tumor should express the same X-linked allele. By examining expression of different isoenzymes of the sex-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) locus in heterozygous women, Gartler and Linder demonstrated that leiomyoma tumor cells, even from cancers consisting of billions of cells, expressed only one form of the marker, whereas even small patches of normal tissue contained cells expressing both forms of the marker. This finding was consistent with the growth of a single founder cell into a tumor. The clonal origin of tumors has been confirmed many times since, initially through the work of a junior colleague Philip J. Fialkow.",
