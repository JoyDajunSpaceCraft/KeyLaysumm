The finished genomic sequence is analyzed using a modified Ensembl pipeline, and BLAST results of cDNAs/ESTs and proteins, along with various ab initio predictions, can be analyzed manually in the annotation browser tool Otterlace. Thus, more alternative spliced variants can be predicted compared with cDNA annotation. Moreover, genomic annotation produces a more comprehensive analysis of pseudogenes. There are several analysis groups in the GENCODE consortium that run pipelines that aid the manual annotators in producing models in unannotated regions, and to identify potential missed or incorrect manual annotation, including completely missing loci, missing alternative isoforms, incorrect splice sites and incorrect biotypes. These are fed back to the manual annotators using the AnnoTrack tracking system. Some of these pipelines use data from other ENCODE subgroups including RNASeq data, histone modification and CAGE and Ditag data. RNAseq data is an important new source of evidence, but generating complete gene models from it is a difficult problem. As part of GENCODE, a competition was run to assess the quality of predictions produced by various RNAseq prediction pipelines (Refer to RGASP below). To confirm uncertain models, GENCODE also has an experimental validation pipeline using RNA sequencing and RACE",

Another limitation of alignment-based approaches is their computational complexity and are time-consuming and thus, are limited when dealing with large-scale sequence data.

Many other inferences based on past biological knowledge can be inferred if that particular region of CpGs have been studied and associated with changes in transcription. This can be used as an additional filter for identifying regions to pursue for functional validation. Several bioinformatic tools that have been developed for functional enrichment analysis can be applied to differentially methylated regions by first mapping these regions to genes. This is done by mapping the distance between the CpGs and a gene promoter that is potentially regulated by this region. Enrichment analysis based on the genomic region has thus been suggested as a complementary approach and confers substantial interpretive potential. Differentially methylated regions can then be compared to a catalog of genomic regions including, for example, sites enriched for specific chromatin modifications or transcription factor binding sites.",

Alternatively, \"tag based\" technologies like Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and RNA-Seq, which can provide a relative measure of the cellular concentration of different mRNAs, can be used. An advantage of tag-based methods is the \"open architecture\", allowing for the exact measurement of any transcript, with a known or unknown sequence. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as RNA-Seq is another approach, producing vast quantities of sequence data that can be matched to a reference genome.

Identifying genes in long sequences remains a problem, especially when the number of genes is unknown. Hidden markov models can be part of the solution. Machine learning has played a significant role in predicting the sequence of transcription factors. Traditional sequencing analysis focused on the statistical parameters of the nucleotide sequence itself (The most common programs used are listed in Table 4.1). Another method is to identify homologous sequences based on other known gene sequences (Tools see Table 4.3). The two methods described here are focused on the sequence.

Each SNP represents a nucleotide change between two individuals at a defined location. SNPs are the most common genetic variant found in all individual with one SNP every 100\u2013300 bp in some species.

These tools examine whether a SNP resides in functional genomic regions such as exons, splice sites, or transcription regulatory sites, and predict the potential corresponding functional effects that the SNP may have using a variety of machine-learning approaches.

After a library is created, the genome of an organism can be sequenced to elucidate how genes affect an organism or to compare similar organisms at the genome-level. The aforementioned genome-wide association studies can identify candidate genes stemming from many functional traits. Genes can be isolated through genomic libraries and used on human cell lines or animal models to further research. Furthermore, creating high-fidelity clones with accurate genome representation- and no stability issues- would contribute well as intermediates for shotgun sequencing or the study of complete genes in functional analysis.",

The research findings from both areas are transferred to practices supporting sustainable use and the protection of plant diversity. Here, the spectrum ranges from the development of genetic resources (Applied Plant Sciences) to the management of varied eco-systems. Public relations and communication tools are also used to present the findings in a more accessible form to a broader audience. Function and Diversity research aims to produce new insights into the evolutionary development of the morphological and functional diversity of plants. The evolution of new traits and the mechanisms of genome evolutions are studied by combining comparative genomics with phylogenetic, biochemical and molecular techniques. The topics addressed include the evolution and function of signal transfer processes in plant cells, the role of the numerous plant secondary metabolites, the uptake and utilization of nutrients as well as the development of morphological features. This work is based on the rapidly growing information available from genome sequencing. In the meantime this goes far beyond the model plant Arabidopsis, previously the focus of much research, and opens up numerous approaches capable of contributing to a better understanding of gene functions and the evolution of biological diversity. The close links to the newly established Berlin Consortium for Genomics in Biodiversity Research play a significant role in research into genome sequence and structure. In the Plant and Environment field of research, the focus is on plant functions and adaptive reactions in the context of constantly changing environmental conditions. This complex topic requires a transdisciplinary approach to understand the context (phylogeny, plant geography, ecology) as well as the mechanisms (physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology). Together with its regional partners, the \"Dahlem Centre of Plant Sciences\" covers the broad spectrum of expertise required here. The research concentrates on plant reactions to such abiotic stress factors as light intensity, extremes of temperature, lack of water and nutrients, as well as plant biotic interactions with other organisms, for example, insects or fungi. The research groups are working on such diverse themes as, for instance, the responses of plants to pathogens, plants\u2019 cellular memory for environmental stress, the role of root architecture in fungi colonisation and its significance for crop yields and the mechanisms of neighbouring plants to communicate with each other.",

Strain specific genes are those found only in one strain of a pathogen species. The differences in pan-genomes are reflections of the life style of the organism. For example, Streptococcus agalactiae, which exists in diverse biological niches, has a broader pan-genome when compared with the more environmentally isolated Bacillus anthracis.
