The XRD results were observed that crystal structure of catalyst remained unchanged after the sixth run while catalytic activity slightly decreases at 97% conversion in the final run. In this reaction, the mechanistic study showed the catalytic cycle started from Cu to Cu and then oxidized to Cu by aryl iodine. The role of copper has been further emphasized in the coupling reaction of ortho-arylated phenols and dialkylformamides. It was observed that there was a single-electron oxidative addition of copper to copper through a radical step, then transformed back to copperI by reductive elimination in the presence of either oxygen or peroxide. Catalyst can be reused 9 times without significant loss in catalytic activities. Notably, synergistic effect was demonstrated for the case of CuFeO in Sonogashira reaction. Both Fe and Cu center contribute to catalytic activity of the transformation between aryl halide and substituted alkynes.

The crystal structure of covellite has been reported several times, and whilst these studies are in general agreement on assigning the space group P6/mmc there are small discrepancies in bond lengths and angles between them. The structure was described as \"extraordinary\" by Wells and is quite different from copper(II) oxide, but similar to CuSe (klockmannite). The covellite unit cell contains 6 formula units (12 atoms) in which: The formulation of copper sulfide as CuS (i.e. containing no sulfur-sulfur bond) is clearly incompatible with the crystal structure, and also at variance with the observed diamagnetism as a Cu(II) compound would have a d configuration and be expected to be paramagnetic.  Studies using XPS indicate that all of the copper atoms have an oxidation state of +1. This contradicts a formulation based on the crystal structure and obeying the octet rule that is found in many textbooks (e.g.) describing CuS as containing both Cu and Cu i.e. (Cu)Cu(S)S. An alternative formulation as (Cu)(S)(S) was proposed and supported by calculations. The formulation should not be interpreted as containing radical anion, but rather that there is a delocalized valence \"hole\". Electron paramagnetic resonance studies on the precipitation of Cu(II) salts indicates that the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) occurs in solution.",

Furthermore, both the oxidized Cu(II)-Cu(II) state and the reduced Cu(I)-Cu(I) state were the two states identified by the crystal structure of \"Ipomoea batatas\". The monodentate binding of catechol to the copper center was supported by the crystal structure of catechol oxidase bound with the bound-substrate analogue inhibitor phenylthiourea, which also binds to the copper center in a monodentate fashion. However, one issue with this catalytic cycle is that the charge of the active site changes during the catalytic cycle from +1 to +3. This necessitates the presence of nearby bases that can store the protons; however, the X-ray crystal structure does not indicate the presence of any such bases as the histidine residues are coordinated with the copper centers. Other catalytic cycles elucidated with DFT calculations and crystal structures have been proposed which maintain the same charge in the active site throughout the cycle and thus do not require nearby bases.

Inclusion of a Phe analogue in the crystal structure changes both iron from a six- to a five-coordinated state involving a single water molecule and bidentate coordination to Glu330 and opening a site for oxygen to bind. BH4 is concommitantly shifted toward the iron atom, although the pterin cofactor remains in the second coordination sphere.

One mechanism proposed by Eicken et al. is based on the crystal structure of catechol oxidase purified from \"Ipomoea batatas\". The catalytic cycle begins with the catechol oxidase in its native oxidized Cu(II)-Cu(II) state with a coordinated hydroxide ion bridging the two copper centers. As catechol enters the active site, a proton is abstracted from one of the alcohols. The catechol coordinates with a Cu(II) center in a monodentate fashion, displacing one of the coordinating histidine residues. The coordinated hydroxide ion abstracts another proton from catechol to form water, and the catechol is oxidized to o-quinone. The two resulting electrons reduce both copper centers to their Cu(I)-Cu(I) state. Dioxygen then binds one copper center, displacing the coordinated water molecule, and another molecule of catechol binds to the other copper center, displacing another histidine residue. This forms a complex in which one copper center has a tetragonal planar coordination with His240, His244 and the dioxygen molecule. The other copper center retains its initial tetragonal pyramidal geometry with dioxygen, His88 and His118 in the equatorial positions, and His109 in an axial position. In this state, the enzyme active site is in a ternary catechol oxidase\u2013O\u2013catechol complex. Two electrons are transferred from the substrate to the dioxygen, followed by cleavage of the O\u2013O bond. Water is released, and the second o-quinone product is formed together with the restoration of the initial Cu(II)-Cu(II) state to complete the catalytic cycle.",

In the presence of a base, the terminal hydrogen, being the most acidic is deprotonated first to give a Cu acetylide intermediate. Studies have shown that the reaction is second order with respect to Cu. It has been suggested that the transition state involves two copper atoms. One copper atom is bonded to the acetylide while the other Cu atom serves to activate the azide. The metal center coordinates with the electrons on the nitrogen atom. The azide and the acetylide are not coordinated to the same Cu atom in this case. The ligands employed are labile and are weakly coordinating. The azide displaces one ligand to generate a copper-azide-acetylide complex. At this point cyclization takes place.

Tao et al performed MD simulations of nanoindentation on Cu/Ni nanotwinned multilayers films using a spherical indenter and investigated the effects of hetero-twin interface and twin thickness on hardness. Recently, a review paper by Carlos et al is published upon the atomistic studies of nanoindentation. This review covers different nanoindentation mechanisms and effects of surface orientation, crystallography (fcc, bcc, hcp, etc), surface and bulk damage on plasticity. All of the MD-obtained results are very difficult to be achieved in experiment due to the resolution limitation of structural characterization techniques. Among various MD simulation software, such as GROMACS, Xenoview, Amber, etc., LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), which is developed by Sandia National Laboratories, is the most widely used for simulation. An interaction potential and an input file including information of atom ID, coordinates, charges, ensemble, time step, etc are fed to the simulator, and then running could be executed. After specified running timesteps, information such as energy, atomic trajectories, and structural information (such as coordination number) could be output for further analysis, which makes it possible to investigate the nanoindentation mechanism at atomic-scale.

Many can be bought commercially or synthesized in only a few steps from inexpensive starting materials. One pot protocols have been developed for the synthesis of these ligands and have been employed on >10\u00a0kg scales. Their enhanced catalytic activity over other ligands in palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions have been attributed to their electron-richness, steric bulk, and some special structural features. In particular, cyclohexyl, \"t\"-butyl, and adamantyl groups on the phosphorus are used for this purpose as bulky, electron-donating substituents. The lower ring of the biphenyl system, \"ortho\" to the phosphino group, is also a key structural feature. Numerous crystallographic studies have indicated that it behaves as a hemilabile ligand and is believed to play a role in stabilizing the highly reactive, formally 12-electron LPd intermediate during the catalytic cycle. More recently developed ligands generally utilize 2,6-substitution on the lower ring to prevent catalyst decomposition via Pd-mediated C-H activation of these positions. Extensive experimentation by the Buchwald group has shown that further minor changes to the structure of these ligands can dramatically alter their catalytic activity in cross coupling reactions with different substrates. This has led to the evolution of multiple ligands that are tailored for specific transformations. By providing a means of generating the postulated catalytically active LPd species under mild conditions (room temperature or lower in many cases), the development of several generations of base-activated, cyclopalladated precatalysts have further broadened the applicability of the ligands and simplified their use.",

First, DMAP and acetic anhydride react in a pre-equilibrium reaction to form an ion pair of acetate and the acetylpyridinium ion. In the second step the alcohol adds to the acetylpyridinium, and elimination of pyridine forms an ester. Here the acetate acts as a base to remove the proton from the alcohol as it nucleophilically adds to the activated acylpyridinium. The bond from the acetyl group to the catalyst gets cleaved to generate the catalyst and the ester. The described bond formation and breaking process runs synchronous concerted without the appearance of a tetrahedral intermediate. The acetic acid formed will then protonate the DMAP.

The reaction runs through the described nucleophilic reaction pathway irrespective of the anhydride used, but the mechanism changes with the pKa value of the alcohol used. For example, the reaction runs through a base-catalyzed reaction pathway in the case of a phenol.

Klimasaukas and colleagues used this technique to observe the first base flipping phenomenon, in which their experimental procedure involved several steps:  During purification, Haemophilus haemolyticus methyltransferase was overexpressed and purified using a high salt back-extraction step to selectively solubilize M.HhaI, followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) as done previously by Kumar and colleagues.

An example of a reaction where aromatic AOX content has been reduced is demonstrated in figure 2 above. While little is known about the dehalogenation mechanisms of polyhalogenated phenols (PHPs) and polyhalogenated benzenes (PHBs), regioselectivity for halide location on the aromatic ring was observed. This regioselectivity is however dominated by both redox potentials for the reaction and the microbe's familiarity to the reaction. Moreover, due to the specificity of most microbes along with complex aromatic structures, in order to achieve a complete dehalogenation, a mixture of more than one species of bacteria and/or fungi (often known as a consortium) is utilized. The reaction in figure 2 shows the reductive debromination of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) by \"Ochrabactrum\". Based on the relative degradation of the molecule along with analytical results, it has been postulated that degradation of 2,4,6-TBP proceeds through debromination of \"ortho\"-bromine in the first step by a dehalogenase to yield 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP). Since there are two \"ortho\" bromines, debromination of either \"ortho\" carbons would yield the same product . Other species such as \"Pseudomonas galthei\" or \"Azotobacter sp.\" showed preference for \"para\"-halide over the \"meta\"- \"or ortho\" -halides. For example, the \"Azotobacter sp.\" degrades 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) into 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone due to TCP-4-monooxygenase selectivity differences between \"ortho-\" and \"para\"-halide. These differences in regioselectivity between the species can be attributed to the specificity of the 3-dimensional enzyme structure and its hindrance from steric interactions. It has been postulated that a proton lost by the phenol group of 2,4,6-TBP resulting in the formation of a negatively charged halo-phenolate ion. Subsequent attack of the \"para-\"carbon with a hydride anion from NAD(P)H in a nucleophilic attack manner and resonance rearrangement results in substitution of bromine with hydride and formation of 2,4-DBP. Subsequent steps in a similar pattern yield 2-bromophenol, and phenol in the final step. Phenol can be metabolized by microorganisms to make methane and carbon dioxide or can be extracted easier than AOXs.",

The Suzuki reaction is an organic reaction, classified as a coupling reaction, where the coupling partners are a boronic acid and an organohalide catalyzed by a palladium(0) complex. It was first published in 1979 by Akira Suzuki and he shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Richard F. Heck and Ei-ichi Negishi for their effort for discovery and development of palladium-catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis. In many publications this reaction also goes by the name Suzuki\u2013Miyaura reaction and is also referred to as the Suzuki coupling. It is widely used to synthesize poly-olefins, styrenes, and substituted biphenyls. Several reviews have been published describing advancements and the development of the Suzuki Reaction. The general scheme for the Suzuki reaction is shown below where a carbon-carbon single bond is formed by coupling an organoboron species (R-BY) with a halide (R-X) using a palladium catalyst and a base. ][\\text{Base}] R1-R2 The mechanism of the Suzuki reaction is best viewed from the perspective of the palladium catalyst 1. The first step is the oxidative addition of palladium to the halide 2 to form the organopalladium species 3. Reaction with base gives intermediate 4, which via transmetalation with the boron-ate complex 6 (produced by reaction of the boronic acid 5 with base) forms the organopalladium species 8. Reductive elimination of the desired product 9 restores the original palladium catalyst 1 which completes the catalytic cycle. The Suzuki coupling takes place in the presence of a base and for a long time the role of the base was not fully understood. The base was first believed to form a trialkyl borate (RB-OR), in the case of a reaction of an trialkylborane (BR) and alkoxide (OR); this species could be considered as being more nucleophilic and then more reactive towards the palladium complex present in the transmetalation step. Duc and coworkers investigated the role of the base in the reaction mechanism for the Suzuki coupling and they found that the base has three roles: Formation of the palladium complex [ArPd(OR)L], formation of the trialkyl borate and the acceleration of the reductive elimination step by reaction of the alkoxide with the palladium complex.",

Dnr S, daunosamine glycosyltransferase catalyzes the addition of the TDP activated glycoside, L-daunosamine-TDP to \u03b5-rhodomycinone to give rhodomycin D (Figure 2). The release of TDP drives the reaction forward. The enzyme has sequence similarity to glycosyltransferases of the other \"unusual sugars\" added to Type II PKS aromatic products. Dnr P, rhodomycin D methylesterase, removes the methyl group added previously by DnrC. It initially served to activate the adjacent methylene bridge, and after that it prevented its carboxyl group from leaving the C-10 carbon (see Fig 2). Had the carboxyl group not been esterified prior to the fourth ring cyclization, its departure as [ CO2 would have been favored by the formation of a bicyclic aromatic system. After C-7 reduction and glycosylation, the C-8 methylene bridge is no longer activated for deprotonation, thereby making aromatization less likely. Note that the non-isolable intermediate, with numbering, is the 3rd molecule in Figure 2. The numbering system is very odd and a vestige of early nomenclature. The decarboxylation of the intermediate occurs spontaneously, or by the influence of Dnr P, giving 13-deoxycarminomycin. A crystal structure, with bound products, of aclacinomycin methylesterase, an [enzyme] with 53% sequence homology to Dnr P, from \"streptomyces purpurascens\", has been solved. It is able to catalyze the same reaction and uses a classic Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad with serine acting as the nucleophile and gly-met providing stabilization of the transition state by forming an \"oxyanion hole\". The active site amino acids are almost entirely the same as Dnr P, and the mechanism is almost certainly identical. Although Dox A is shown next in the biosynthetic scheme (Figure 2), Dnr K, carminomycin 4-O-methyltransferase is able to O-methylate the 4-hydroxyl group of any of the glycosides in Figure 2. A 2.35 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the enzyme with bound products has recently been solved. The orientation of the products is consistent with a SN2 mechanism of methyl transfer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the potential acid/base residues in the active site did not affect catalysis leading to the conclusion that Dnr K most likely acts as an entropic enzyme in that rate enhancement is mainly due to orientational and proximity effects. This is in contrast to most other O-methyltransferases where acid/base catalysis has been demonstrated to be an essential contribution to rate enhancement. Dox A catalyzes three successive oxidations in \"streptomyces peucetius\". Deficient DXR production is not primarily due to low levels of or malfunctioning Dox A, but because there are many products diverted away from the pathway shown in Figure 2. Each of the glycosides is a potential target of shunt enzymes, not shown, some of which are products of the dnr gene cluster. Mutations of these enzymes does significantly boost DXR production. In addition, Dox A has a very low kcat/Km value for C-14 oxidation (130/M) compared to C-13 oxidation (up to 22,000/M for some substrates). Genetic manipulation to overexpress Dox A has also increased yields, particularly if the genes for the shunt enzymes are inactivated simultaneously. Dox A is a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase that has broad substrate specificity, catalyzing anthracycline hydroxylation at C-13 and C-14 ( Figure 2). The enzyme has an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen and NADPH. Initially, two successive oxidations are done at C-13, followed by a single oxidation of C-14 that converts daunorubicin to doxorubicin.",

One mechanism proposed by Eicken et al. is based on the crystal structure of catechol oxidase purified from \"Ipomoea batatas\". The catalytic cycle begins with the catechol oxidase in its native oxidized Cu(II)-Cu(II) state with a coordinated hydroxide ion bridging the two copper centers. As catechol enters the active site, a proton is abstracted from one of the alcohols. The catechol coordinates with a Cu(II) center in a monodentate fashion, displacing one of the coordinating histidine residues. The coordinated hydroxide ion abstracts another proton from catechol to form water, and the catechol is oxidized to o-quinone. The two resulting electrons reduce both copper centers to their Cu(I)-Cu(I) state. Dioxygen then binds one copper center, displacing the coordinated water molecule, and another molecule of catechol binds to the other copper center, displacing another histidine residue. This forms a complex in which one copper center has a tetragonal planar coordination with His240, His244 and the dioxygen molecule. The other copper center retains its initial tetragonal pyramidal geometry with dioxygen, His88 and His118 in the equatorial positions, and His109 in an axial position. In this state, the enzyme active site is in a ternary catechol oxidase\u2013O\u2013catechol complex. Two electrons are transferred from the substrate to the dioxygen, followed by cleavage of the O\u2013O bond. Water is released, and the second o-quinone product is formed together with the restoration of the initial Cu(II)-Cu(II) state to complete the catalytic cycle.",

A dozen enzymes (cuproenzymes) use changes in copper oxidation state to catalyze important biochemical reactions including cellular respiration (cytochrome c oxidase), antioxidant defense (ceruloplasmin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), detoxification (metallothioneins), blood clotting (blood clotting factors V and VIII), melanin production (tyrosinase) and the connective tissue formation (lysyl peroxidase). Copper is required for iron metabolism, oxygenation, neurotransmission, embryonic development and many other essential biological processes. Another function of copper is signaling \u2013 for example, stem cells require a certain level of copper in the media to start their differentiation into cells needed for repair. Thus, GHK-Cu\u2019s ability to bind copper and to modulate its tissue level is a key factor determining its biological activity.",

            "document": "Glutathione . Glutathione plays an important role in preventing oxidative damage to the skin. In addition to its many recognized biological functions, glutathione has also been associated with skin lightening ability. The role of glutathione as a skin whitener was discovered as a side effect of large doses of glutathione. Glutathione utilizes different mechanisms to exert its action as a skin whitening agent at various levels of melanogenesis. It inhibits melanin synthesis by means of stopping the neurotransmitter precursor L-DOPA's ability to interact with tyrosinase in the process of melanin production. Glutathione inhibits the actual production as well as agglutination of melanin by interrupting the function of L-DOPA. Another study found that glutathione inhibits melanin formation by direct inactivation of the enzyme tyrosinase by binding and chelating copper within the enzyme's active site. Glutathione's antioxidant property allows it to inhibit melanin synthesis by quenching of free radicals and peroxides that contribute to tyrosinase activation and melanin formation. Its antioxidant property also protects the skin from UV radiation and other environmental as well as internal stressors that generate free radicals that cause skin damage and hyperpigmentation. In most mammals, melanin formation consists of eumelanin (brown-black pigment) and pheomelanin ( yellow-red pigment) as either mixtures or co-polymers. Increase in glutathione level may induce the pigment cell to produce pheomelanin instead of eumelanin pigments. A research by Te-Sheng Chang found lowest levels of reduced glutathione to be associated with eumelanin type pigmentation, whereas the highest ones were associated with the pheomelanin. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that depletion of glutathione would result in eumelanin formation. Prota observed that decreased glutathione concentration led to the conversion of L-Dopaquinone to Dopachrome, increasing the formation of brown-black pigment (eumelanin).",

One of the proposed mechanism outlines the hydrolysis of 5-membered ring lactone substrates by serum Paraoxonase-1. PON1, as with PON2 and PON3, utilizes a catalytic calcium ion, which functions as an oxy-anion to stabilize substrate and reaction states. Additionally, this enzyme active site employs two Histadine residues (His115 and 134) involved in proton transfers, a glutamic acid (Glu53) to stabilize reactive hydrogens, and an Asparagine (Asn168) to stabilize transition states and intermediates in the active site.

The overall, generalized overview of the proposed mechanism of thiosulfate dehydrogenase can be summarized by the following two reversible redox reactions: </chem> Step 1 indicates an initial binding of thiosulfate to an unusual and reactive cysteine \"S\"-sulphane adduct, forming a \"S\"-thiosulfonate adduct. Step 2 follows with an additional thiosulfate to subsequently form tetrathionate while reducing both hemes and leaving a typical cysteine residue. In the active site, the cysteine residue binded to the catalytic iron heme is essential for enzymatic activity, as the abolishment of this residue completely eliminated the enzyme's ability to both oxidize thiosulfate and reduce tetrathionate. In \"A. vinosum\", although the process is reversible, the reaction to form two thiosulfate ions is much slower than the formation of tetrathionate despite the reduction of tetrathionate to thiosulfate having a potential of +198 mV.",
