It was during this period in the late 1970s that she began studying onchocerciasis (river blindness) after encountering the disease during her travels around the area. She joined a rural women's support group in order to better study the social effects that the disease had on rural communities. She then applied for and received a research grant from the United Nations\u2019 Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) in order to continue her research into river blindness. She then worked for the TDR for several years, where she developed a program for training community workers to treat themselves and others, and keep record books of the treatments. She brought her findings to the WHO, where her studies were replicated. The results from this replication resulted in the founding of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) in 1995. Amazigo joined the APOC as a scientist in 1996. Her work with the APOC built upon her work with the TDR, and resulted in the development of Community-Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI), with ivermectin being the drug that treats onchocerciasis. It is estimated that her CDTI strategy has resulted in the treatment of over 112.4 million people for onchocerciasis, 11 million people for malaria control, and 37 million people for the control of other diseases. Amazigo spent four years as the Chief of the WHO's sustainable drug distribution unit from 2001-2005. She served as the director of the APOC from 2005 until 2011. During this period, she engaged 16 African governments, 14 international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 20 bilateral and multi-lateral donors, and pharmaceutical companies. After retiring from the APOC, she founded the Pan-African Community Initiative on Education and Health (PACIEH) in 2013.",

The study incorporated aspects related to quality of healthcare including interactive quality of physicians, base-level expectation about primary health care facilities in the area, and non-medical physical facilities (including drinking water and restroom facilities). In terms of adherence to treatment, two sub-factors were investigated, persistence of treatment and treatment-supporting adherence (changes in health behaviors that supplement the overall treatment plan). The findings indicated that the different quality of healthcare factors surveyed all had a direct influence on both sub-factors of adherence to treatment. Furthermore, the base-level expectation component in quality of healthcare perception, presented the most significant influence on overall adherence to treatment, with the interactive quality of physicians having the least influence on adherence to treatment, of three aspects investigated in this study.",

A major conclusion was that the mean infection intensity of hookworm was significantly lower in the villages employing the community-directed treatment approach than the school-based approach. The community-directed treatment model used in this specific study allowed villagers to take control of the child's treatment by having villagers select their own community drug distributors to administer the antihelminthic drugs. Additionally, villagers organized and implemented their own methods for distributing the drugs to all children. The positive results associated with this new model highlight the need for large-scale community involvement in deworming campaigns.",

The relevance of networks in individuals' electoral choices was first identified by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues in The People\u2019s Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign and in Voting: A Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign. Their findings were mainly based on a survey gathered in 1940 in Erie County, Ohio and on a survey collected in 1948 in Elmira, New York. The model proposed by them is usually referred to as the model of Columbia Studies. Individuals' perception of the political world is conceptualized in network terms according to this model. The main argument of these books is that the interpersonal influence of their families, friends and co-workers form voters\u2019 political views. Voters\u2019 choices are shaped through interpersonal communication networks. These horizontal networks have a stronger effect on individuals\u2019 political decisions than the opinions and viewpoints presented and framed in the media. Social categories \u2013 such as religion and class \u2013 may also explain individuals\u2019 choices. A businessman with friends and co-workers from that class is more likely to vote for a Republican candidate than a blue-collar worker. The findings may be concluded in the following way: \"they (voting decisions) are relatively invulnerable to direct argumentation and vulnerable to indirect social influences\u201d. Major criticisms of this model were developed on their data collection methods. Respondents were asked about the possible opinions of their three best friends and three closest co-workers. However, not the actual opinions of these individuals, rather respondents' perceptions of their opinions were collected. This is why some authors think that the Columbia Studies can not be regarded as a predecessor of social network analysis.",

According to Gourdine and Lemmons' study, Perceptions of Misogyny in Hip Hop and Rap: What Do the Youths Think?, the youth population is highly affected and involved in the hip hop and rap music industry. Individuals from ages 18\u201324 spend a majority of their time listening to this type of music, so researchers Gourdine and Lemmons conducted this study and found that it was easier to understand youth's perceptions on misogyny by focusing on their listening habits and age. When first conducting this research, it was difficult for youth to express their opinions due to the fact that they already had a preconceived notion that adults did not support rap music, \"the youths expressed concern that there were different genres of hip hop and rap music and that one needed to understand the history of those artists who fell into what they termed \"conscious\" and \"unconscious\" categorizations\" (Gourdine, 2008). The youth admitted that, \"Even those youths who embrace the lifestyle agree that the media sensationalizes a way of living that can do harm to their communities\" (Brown & Gourdine, 1998, 2001, 2007). After conducting a study amongst 262 individuals in an undergraduate college, the researchers revealed that the youth, \"who listened to rap and hip hop music less frequently were more likely to have negative perceptions of and attitudes toward the music, and those who listened more frequently were more likely to have positive perceptions and attitudes\u2026That is, the younger group (18- to 20-year-olds) reported significantly greater scores on the violent-misogyny subscale indicating more positive perceptions and attitudes toward rap and hip hop music than the older group (21- to 23-year-olds)\" (Gourdine, 2008). This study came to the conclusion that the younger the individuals listening to this rap and hip hop music, the more likely they did not identify the misogyny that came with this type of music. According to Gourdine and Lemmons, the older the individuals are, the more likely they are mature and disidentify with the harsh words and misogyny against women in rap music. Gourdine and Lemmons suggest that in order to improve the youth's understanding on rap music we must, \"[monitor] the amount of time spent listening to music, which gives youths other alternatives. This study indicates that the younger the youths, the more likely they will listen to rap. This population is college-age, and the maturity factor may have affected the findings in this study. A study looking at younger youths is needed. The opportunity to analyze the music can be useful as well\" (Gourdine, 2008).",

According to the Office of Minority Health, black people comprise 12.9% of the U.S. population, yet they are 30% more likely than European Americans to report serious psychological distress. Moreover black people are more likely to have Major Depressive Disorder, and communicate higher instances of intense symptoms/disability. For this reason, researchers have attempted to examine the sociological causes and systemic inequalities which contribute to these disparities in order to highlight issues for further investigation. Nonetheless, much of the research on the mental well-being of black people are unable to separate race, culture, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or behavioural and biological factors. According to Hunter and Schmidt (2010), there are three distinct beliefs embraced by black people which speak to their socio-cultural experience in the United States: a perception of racism, stigma associated with mental illness, and the importance of physical health. According to Raymond Depaulo, M.D., African Americans are less likely to report depression due to heavy social stigma within their community and culture. All of these social aspects of mental health can create a lot of distress. Therefore, discrimination within the healthcare community and larger society, attitudes related to mental health, and general physical health contribute largely to the mental well-being of black people . Mental health in the black community is a major issue that is often overlooked due to lack of information, stigmas and socio-economic factors. These factors have been the cause of suicide rates between teens ages 10-14 rising 233% within the last 15 years. Community based issues have also caused black people to be 20% more likely to experience serious mental health conditions than the general population. Among the stigmas within the black people community, there is also a major discord between mental health providers and their black patients in regards to proper diagnosis and treatment. It is an issue that is increasingly getting worse, and one that demands that more be done to fight the problems that these mental health issues cause within the black community.",

The emergence of online avatars have implications for domains of scholarly research such as technoself studies, which is concerned with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and also the social avatar and its effects upon the psyche.  Across the literature, scholars have focused on three overlapping aspects that influence users\u2019 perceptions of the social potential of avatars (Novak and Fox, 2018): agency, anthropomorphism, and realism. Following Novak and Fox (2018), researchers must differentiate \"perceived agency\" (whether or not an entity is perceived to be human), \"anthropomorphism\" (having human form or behavior), and \"realism\" (the perception that something could realistically or possibly exist in a non-mediated context). Perceived agency influences people\u2019s responses in the interaction regardless of who or what is actually controlling the representation. A meta-analysis of studies comparing agents and avatars (Fox et al., 2015) found that both agency and perceived agency mattered: representations controlled by humans were more persuasive than those controlled by bots, and representations believed to be controlled by humans were more persuasive than those believed to be controlled by bots. Researchers have investigated how anthropomorphic representations influence communicative outcomes and found that more human-like representations are judged more favorably; people consider them more attractive, credible, and competent (Westerman, Tamborini, & Bowman, 2015). Higher levels of anthropomorphism also lead to higher involvement, social presence, and communication satisfaction (Kang & Watt, 2013). Moreover, people communicate more naturally with more anthropomorphic avatars (Heyselaar, Hagoort, & Segaert, 2017). Anthropomorphism is also tied to social influence, as more human-like representations can be more persuasive (Gong, 2008).",

The extent to which an individual perceives the protection of the recommended action against the health risk determines whether they are persuaded to perform the recommended course of action. A positive perception of treatment efficacy is internalized by the emphasis of the positive aspects of the recommended action.

Inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400\u00a0copies/mL. Based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95% of people during the first year. Benefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death. In the developing world treatment also improves physical and mental health. With treatment there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis. Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother-to-child transmission. The effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance. Reasons for non-adherence include poor access to medical care, inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse. The complexity of treatment regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may reduce adherence. Even though cost is an important issue with some medications, 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low and middle income countries as of 2010 and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries. Specific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken. Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children. Treatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than 5 years of age; children above 5 are treated like adults. The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000\u00a0copies/mL between one year and five years of age.",

This gap between the perceptions of effectiveness among whites and minority groups was found to be the same ten years after CAPS implementation as it was before the strategy was implemented in 1993, illustrating that the CAPS did not effectively bridge the gap between the police and the community as a whole.

In daily life, individuals are more likely to encounter white people as the default race within the United States as opposed to Black individuals.

Lay people are more racially biased, on average, than trained individuals such as police officers. Prototypicality is shown to moderate racial bias which has been shown to be linked to a perceived threat as black people specifically are predisposed to being viewed as more threatening. Police officers show a reduced racial bias in comparison to members of the community; however, police officers were no better than community members in their sensitivity to prototypic targets providing evidence that prototypicality is directly linked to stereotypes and threat perception which ultimately perpetuates stereotype threat. Members of the same category (race) become harder to distinguish from other members of the same category the more they look like a prototypical representation of their category.

She joined a rural women's support group in order to better study the social effects that the disease had on rural communities. She then applied for and received a research grant from the United Nations\u2019 Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) in order to continue her research into river blindness. She then worked for the TDR for several years, where she developed a program for training community workers to treat themselves and others, and keep record books of the treatments. She brought her findings to the WHO, where her studies were replicated. The results from this replication resulted in the founding of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) in 1995. Amazigo joined the APOC as a scientist in 1996. Her work with the APOC built upon her work with the TDR, and resulted in the development of Community-Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI), with ivermectin being the drug that treats onchocerciasis. It is estimated that her CDTI strategy has resulted in the treatment of over 112.4 million people for onchocerciasis, 11 million people for malaria control, and 37 million people for the control of other diseases.

Studies have demonstrated that transmission of the infection can be broken when a single dose of combined oral medicines is consistently maintained annually for approximately seven years. The strategy for eliminating transmission of lymphatic filariasis is mass distribution of medicines that kill the microfilariae and stop transmission of the parasite by mosquitoes in endemic communities. In sub-Saharan Africa, albendazole is being used with ivermectin to treat the disease, whereas elsewhere in the world albendazole is used with diethylcarbamazine. Using a combination of treatments better reduces the number of microfilariae in blood. Avoiding mosquito bites, such as by using insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets, also reduces the transmission of lymphatic filariasis. In the Americas, >90% of the burden of lymphatic filariasis is on the island of Hispaniola (comprising Haiti and the Dominican Republic). An elimination effort to address this is currently under way alongside the malaria effort described above; the Dominican Republic expects to eliminate its seven remaining foci by 2010, but lymphatic filariasis is still endemic to 110 of 140 communes in Haiti.",
