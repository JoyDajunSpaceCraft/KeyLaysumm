RtxA is a virulence factor involved in cholera which facilitates colonization of \"V. cholerae\" the small intestine. RtxA causes destruction of the actin cytoskeleton in host cells through G-actin modification and destruction of Rho GTPases. The toxin contains four functional domains: an actin cross-linking domain (ACD), a Rho-inactivating domain (RID), a cysteine protease domain (CPD), and an \u03b1\u03b2-hydrolase. In \"V. cholerae\" infection, the CPD binds to inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP, Phytic acid) inside eukaryotic host cells.

This allows each effector to act independently within the host cell, this increases the effects of RtxA because the ACD and RID function in different locations within the cell.

STEC-HUS is usually preceded by a prodrome of diarrhea, which is often bloody, and is caused by Shiga-like toxin-producing bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic \"Escherichia coli\" (EHEC), of which \"E. coli\" O157:H7 is the most common serotype. Other serotypes also cause disease and can emerge as new causes of STEC-HUS, as occurred with \"E. coli\" O104:H4, which triggered a 2011 epidemic of STEC-HUS in Germany.",

Food poisoning caused by \"E. coli\" can result from eating unwashed vegetables or poorly butchered and undercooked meat. O157:H7 is also notorious for causing serious and even life-threatening complications such as hemolytic-uremic syndrome. This particular strain is linked to the 2006 United States \"E. coli\" outbreak due to fresh spinach. The strain is equally virulent. Antibiotic and supportive treatment protocols for it are not as well-developed (it has the ability to be very enterohemorrhagic like O157:H7, causing bloody diarrhea, but also is more enteroaggregative, meaning it adheres well and clumps to intestinal membranes). It is the strain behind the deadly June 2011 E. coli outbreak in Europe. Severity of the illness varies considerably; it can be fatal, particularly to young children, the elderly or the immunocompromised, but is more often mild. Earlier, poor hygienic methods of preparing meat in Scotland killed seven people in 1996 due to \"E. coli\" poisoning, and left hundreds more infected. \"E. coli\" can harbour both heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxins. The latter, termed LT, contain one A subunit and five B subunits arranged into one holotoxin, and are highly similar in structure and function to cholera toxins. The B subunits assist in adherence and entry of the toxin into host intestinal cells, while the A subunit is cleaved and prevents cells from absorbing water, causing diarrhea. LT is secreted by the Type 2 secretion pathway.",

Horses are considered the natural host for \"B. mallei\" infection and are highly susceptible to it. \"B. mallei\" infects and gains access to the cell of its host through lysis of the entry vacuole. \"B. mallei\" has bacterial protein-dependent, actin-based motility once inside the cell. It is also able to initiate host cell fusion that results in multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs). The consequence of MNGCs has yet to be determined, but it may allow the bacteria to spread to different cells, evade responses by the infected host\u2019s immune system, or allow the bacteria to remain in the host longer. \"B. mallei\" is able to survive inside host cells through its capabilities in disrupting the bacteria-killing functions of the cell. It leaves the vacuoles early, which allows for efficient replication of the bacteria inside the cell. Leaving the cell early also keeps the bacteria from being destroyed by lysosomal defensins and other pathogen-killing agents. MNGCs may help protect the bacteria from immune responses. \"B. mallei\"\u2019s ability to live within the host cell makes developing a vaccine against it difficult and complex. The vaccine would need to create a cell-mediated immune response, as well as a humoral response to the bacteria in to be effective in protecting against \"B. mallei\".

However, at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, flagella cease to develop and the bacterium instead usurps the host cell's cytoskeleton to move. \"Listeria\", inventively, polymerizes an actin tail or \"comet\", from actin monomers in the host's cytoplasm with the promotion of virulence factor ActA. The comet forms in a polar manner and aids the bacterial migration to the host cell's outer membrane. Gelsolin, an actin filament severing protein, localizes at the tail of \"Listeria\" and accelerates the bacterium's motility. Once at the cell surface, the actin-propelled \"Listeria\" pushes against the cell's membrane to form protrusions called filopods or \"rockets\". The protrusions are guided by the cell's leading edge to contact adjacent cells, which then engulf the \"Listeria\" rocket and the process is repeated, perpetuating the infection.
