Naturally existing strains of \"Wolbachia\" have been shown to be a route for vector control strategies because of their presence in arthropod populations, such as mosquitoes. Due to the unique traits of \"Wolbachia\" that cause cytoplasmic incompatibility, this strain is useful as a promoter of genetic drive within a population. \"Wolbachia\"-infected females are able to produce offspring with uninfected and infected males, however, uninfected females are only able to produce viable offspring with uninfected males. This gives infected females a frequency-dependent reproductive advantage; that is, the advantage is greater the higher the frequency of \"Wolbachia\" in the population. Computational models predict that introducing \"Wolbachia\" strains into natural populations will reduce pathogen transmission and reduce overall disease burden. An example includes \"Wolbachia\" that can be used to control dengue and malaria by eliminating the older insects that contain more parasites. Promoting the survival and reproduction of younger insects lessens selection pressure for evolution of resistance. \"Wolbachia\" strains that are able to reduce dengue transmission include wAllbB and wMelPop with \"Aedes aegypti\", wMel with \"Aedes albopictus\". and \"Aedes aegypti\".",

In the natural environment, \"Wolbachia\" and the Asian tiger mosquito are in a symbiotic relationship, so both species benefit from each other and can evolve together. The relationship between \"Wolbachia\" and its host might not have always been mutualistic, as \"Drosophila\" populations once experienced decreased fecundity in infected females, suggesting that \"Wolbachia\" evolved over time so that infected individuals would actually reproduce much more. The mechanism by which \"Wolbachia\" is inherited through maternal heredity is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. This changes the gamete cells of males and females, making some individuals unable to mate with each other. Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists, \"Wolbachia\" infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a population exposed to \"Wolbachia\" transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations. This is called population replacement, where the population\u2019s overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype. This shows how populations of Asian tiger mosquitoes can vary in number of \"Wolbachia\"-infected individuals, based on how often the infection is transmitted. Due to \"Wolbachia's\" ability to transmit from one host to the next, it can change the average genotype of a population, potentially reducing the population's gene flow with other nearby populations.",

This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs. Dengue is spread by several species of mosquito of the \"Aedes\" type, principally \"A. aegypti\". The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA. A vaccine for dengue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is recommended instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for fever reduction and pain relief in dengue due to an increased risk of bleeding from NSAID use.

The genus \"Wolbachia\" is of considerable interest today due to its ubiquitous distribution, its many different evolutionary interactions, and its potential use as a biocontrol agent.",

The effect arises from changes in the gamete cells caused by intracellular parasites like \"Wolbachia\", which infect a wide range of insect species. As the reproductive incompatibility is caused by bacteria that reside in the cytoplasm of the host cells, it is referred to as cytoplasmic incompatibility. In 1971, Janice Yen and A.

They typically bite during the early morning and in the evening, but they may bite and thus spread infection at any time of day.

Humans are the primary host of the virus, but it also circulates in nonhuman primates. An infection can be acquired via a single bite. A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever, during the initial 2- to 10-day febrile period, becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut. About 8\u201310 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's salivary glands and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life. \"Aedes aegypti\" is particularly involved, as it prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers, to live in close proximity to humans, and to feed on people rather than other vertebrates.",

Malaysia is still undecided on the issue, with doctors there letting the mother make the decision whether or not to abort. Rentokil, a Malaysian pest company, has designed an Integrated Mosquito Management (IMM) program to curb the spread of Aedes mosquito. On October 17, Zika was declared as endemic in Vietnam by the country Health Ministry due to the number of local cases. Vietnam confirmed that one baby has born with microcephaly on October 31. Following the rise of local Zika infection cases in the Philippines, the virus have also been declared as endemic by the country Health Department. The government of the republic hosting the \u201cOne Philippines against Zika\u201d national summit on October 28 with church in the country has joint fight to curb the spread of the virus by issuing a pastoral guidance to help raise awareness about the mosquito-borne disease among local communities.

In addition to the genetic causes of reproductive isolation between species there is another factor that can cause post zygotic isolation: the presence of microorganisms in the cytoplasm of certain species. The presence of these organisms in a species and their absence in another causes the non-viability of the corresponding hybrid. For example, in the semi-species of the group \"D. paulistorum\" the hybrid females are fertile but the males are sterile, this is due to the presence of a \"Wolbachia\" in the cytoplasm which alters spermatogenesis leading to sterility. It is interesting that incompatibility or isolation can also arise at an intraspecific level. Populations of \"D. simulans\" have been studied that show hybrid sterility according to the direction of the cross. The factor determining sterility has been found to be the presence or absence of a microorganism \"Wolbachia\" and the populations tolerance or susceptibility to these organisms. This inter population incompatibility can be eliminated in the laboratory through the administration of a specific antibiotic to kill the microorganism. Similar situations are known in a number of insects, as around 15% of species show infections caused by this symbiont. It has been suggested that, in some cases, the speciation process has taken place because of the incompatibility caused by this bacteria. Two wasp species \"Nasonia giraulti\" and \"N. longicornis\" carry two different strains of \"Wolbachia\". Crosses between an infected population and one free from infection produces a nearly total reproductive isolation between the semi-species. However, if both species are free from the bacteria or both are treated with antibiotics there is no reproductive barrier. \"Wolbachia\" also induces incompatibility due to the weakness of the hybrids in populations of spider mites (\"Tetranychus urticae\"), between \"Drosophila recens\" and \"D. subquinaria\" and between species of \"Diabrotica\" (beetle) and \"Gryllus\" (cricket).",
