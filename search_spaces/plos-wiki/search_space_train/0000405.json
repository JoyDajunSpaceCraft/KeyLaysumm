Histidine kinases are typically homodimeric transmembrane proteins containing a histidine phosphotransfer domain and an ATP binding domain, though there are reported examples of histidine kinases in the atypical HWE and HisKA2 families that are not homodimers. Response regulators may consist only of a receiver domain, but usually are multi-domain proteins with a receiver domain and at least one effector or output domain, often involved in DNA binding. Upon detecting a particular change in the extracellular environment, the HK performs an autophosphorylation reaction, transferring a phosphoryl group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a specific histidine residue. The cognate response regulator (RR) then catalyzes the transfer of the phosphoryl group to an aspartate residue on the response regulator's receiver domain. This typically triggers a conformational change that activates the RR's effector domain, which in turn produces the cellular response to the signal, usually by stimulating (or repressing) expression of target genes.",

Recently it has been shown that a Michaelian signaling pathway can be converted to an ultrasensitive signaling pathway by the introduction of two positive feedback loops. In this synthetic biology approach, Palani and Sarkar began with a linear, graded response pathway, a pathway that showed a proportional increase in signal output relative to the amount of signal input, over a certain range of inputs. This simple pathway was composed of a membrane receptor, a kinase and a transcription factor. Upon activation the membrane receptor phosphorylates the kinase, which moves into the nucleus and phosphorylates the transcription factor, which turns on gene expression. To transform this graded response system into an ultrasensitive, or switch-like signaling pathway, the investigators created two positive feedback loops. In the engineered system, activation of the membrane receptor resulted in increased expression of both the receptor itself and the transcription factor. This was accomplished by placing a promoter specific for this transcription factor upstream of both genes. The authors were able to demonstrate that the synthetic pathway displayed high ultrasensitivity and bistability.",

Recent computational analysis of the effects of a signaling protein's concentration on the presence of an ultrasensitive response has come to complementary conclusions about the influence of a signaling protein's concentration on the conversion of a graded response to an ultrasensitive one. Rather than focus on the generation of signaling proteins through positive feedback, however, the study instead focused on how the dynamics of a signaling protein's exit from the system influences the response. Soyer, Kuwahara, and Csika\u00b4sz-Nagy devised a signaling pathway composed of a protein (P) that possesses two possible states (unmodified P or modified P*) and can be modified by an incoming stimulus E. Furthermore, while the unmodified form, P, is permitted to enter or leave the system, P* is only allowed to leave (i.e. it is not generated elsewhere). After varying the parameters of this system, the researchers discovered that the modification of P to P* can shift between a graded response and an ultrasensitive response via the modification of the exit rates of P and P* relative to each other. The transition from an ultrasensitive response to E and a graded response to E was generated when the two rates went from highly similar to highly dissimilar, irrespective of the kinetics of the conversion from P to P* itself. This finding suggests at least two things: 1) the simplifying assumption that the levels of signaling molecules stay constant in a system can severely limit the understanding of ultrasensitivity's complexity; and 2) it may be possible to induce or inhibit ultrasensitivity artificially by regulating the rates of the entry and exit of signaling molecules occupying a system of interest.",

HKs can act as cellular receptors for signaling molecules in a way analogous to tyrosine kinase receptors (RTK). Multifunctional receptor molecules such as HKs and RTKs typically have portions on the outside of the cell (extracellular domain) that bind to hormone- or growth factor-like molecules, portions that span the cell membrane (transmembrane domain), and portions within the cell (intracellular domain) that contain the enzymatic activity. In addition to kinase activity, the intracellular domains typically have regions that bind to a secondary effector molecule or complex of molecules that further propagate signal transduction within the cell. Distinct from other classes of protein kinases, HKs are usually parts of a two-component signal transduction mechanisms in which HK transfers a phosphate group from ATP to a histidine residue within the kinase, and then to an aspartate residue on the receiver domain of a response regulator protein (or sometimes on the kinase itself).

The SOS response is known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes. The most common cellular signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase to separate the two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA\u2013ssDNA filaments. RecA\u2013ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation.

So for these two levels to cross we simultaneously require Now if the perturbation formula_49 has formula_50 parameters formula_51 we may in general vary these numbers to satisfy these two equations. If we choose the values of formula_54 to formula_55 then both of the equations above have one single free parameter. In general it is not possible to find one formula_56 such that both of the equations are satisfied. However, if we allow another parameter to be free, both of these two equations will now be controlled by the same two parameters  And generally there will be two such values of them for which the equations will be simultaneously satisfied. So with formula_50 distinct parameters formula_60 parameters can always be chosen arbitrarily and still we can find two such formula_56s such that there would be crossing of energy eigenvalues. In other words, the values of formula_62 and formula_63 would be the same for formula_60 freely varying co-ordinates (while the rest of the two co-ordinates are fixed from the condition equations). Geometrically the eigenvalue equations describe a surface in formula_50 dimensional space.  Since their intersection is parametrized by formula_60 coordinates, we may formally state that for formula_50 continuous real parameters controlling the perturbed Hamiltonian, the levels (or surfaces) can only cross at a manifold of dimension formula_60. However the symmetry of the Hamiltonian has a role to play in the dimensionality. If the original Hamiltonian has asymmetric states, formula_70, the off-diagonal terms vanish automatically to ensure hermiticity. This allows us to get rid of the equation formula_71. Now from similar arguments as posed above, it is straightforward that for an asymmetrical Hamiltonian, the intersection of energy surfaces takes place in a manifold of dimension formula_72.",

Recent computational analysis of the effects of a signaling protein's concentration on the presence of an ultrasensitive response has come to complementary conclusions about the influence of a signaling protein's concentration on the conversion of a graded response to an ultrasensitive one. Rather than focus on the generation of signaling proteins through positive feedback, however, the study instead focused on how the dynamics of a signaling protein's exit from the system influences the response. Soyer, Kuwahara, and Csika\u00b4sz-Nagy devised a signaling pathway composed of a protein (P) that possesses two possible states (unmodified P or modified P*) and can be modified by an incoming stimulus E. Furthermore, while the unmodified form, P, is permitted to enter or leave the system, P* is only allowed to leave (i.e. it is not generated elsewhere). After varying the parameters of this system, the researchers discovered that the modification of P to P* can shift between a graded response and an ultrasensitive response via the modification of the exit rates of P and P* relative to each other. The transition from an ultrasensitive response to E and a graded response to E was generated when the two rates went from highly similar to highly dissimilar, irrespective of the kinetics of the conversion from P to P* itself. This finding suggests at least two things: 1) the simplifying assumption that the levels of signaling molecules stay constant in a system can severely limit the understanding of ultrasensitivity's complexity; and 2) it may be possible to induce or inhibit ultrasensitivity artificially by regulating the rates of the entry and exit of signaling molecules occupying a system of interest.",

            "document": "CALPHAD . There are two crucial factors for the success of the CALPHAD method. The first factor is to find realistic as well as convenient mathematical models for the Gibbs energy for each phase. The Gibbs energy is used because most experimental data have been determined at known temperature and pressure and any other thermodynamic quantities can be calculated from it. It is not possible to obtain an exact description of the behavior of the Gibbs energy of a multi-component system with analytical expressions. It is thus necessary to identify the main features and base the mathematical models on them. The discrepancy between model and reality is finally represented by a power series expansion in temperature, pressure and constitution of the phase. The adjustable parameters of these model descriptions are refined to reproduce the experimental data. The strength of the CALPHAD method is that the descriptions of the constituent sub-systems can be combined to describe a multi-component system.",

Ultrasensitivity gives a small response to first input signal, but an increase in the input signal produces higher and higher levels of output. This acts to filter out noise, as small stimuli and threshold concentrations of the stimulus (input signal) is necessary for the trigger which allows the system to get activated quickly. Ultrasensitive responses are represented by sigmoidal graphs, which resemble cooperativity. The quantification of ultrasensitivity is often performed approximately by the Hill equation (biochemistry):",

If we naively set formula_11, we would get the solution labelled \"outer\" below which does not model the boundary layer, for which \"x\" is close to zero. For more details that show how to obtain the uniformly valid approximation, see method of matched asymptotic expansions. An electrically driven robot manipulator can have slower mechanical dynamics and faster electrical dynamics, thus exhibiting two time scales. In such cases, we can divide the system into two subsystems, one corresponding to faster dynamics and other corresponding to slower dynamics, and then design controllers for each one of them separately. Through a singular perturbation technique, we can make these two subsystems independent of each other, thereby simplifying the control problem.",

The mutual distances between the atoms are one set of parameters. If both of the atoms of a diatomic molecule is same, the symmetry suggests that different configurations keeping their mutual distance fixed will result into same electronic states. So it is the relative distance formula_73 which acts as a parameter for the two equations promising level crossing. Hence due to the avoided crossing theorem in general we can not have level crossings between two electronic states of same symmetry. But in polyatomic molecules the number of independent mutual distances of nuclei are more. For a N-atomic molecule the number of independent mutual separation is formula_74 (for formula_75). Each of them acts as a parameter for the total Hamiltonian. Since we always have minimum of three independent parameters, level crossing is not totally avoided in these molecules.",

            "document": "Histidine kinase . Histidine kinases (HK) are multifunctional, and in non-animal kingdoms, typically transmembrane, proteins of the transferase class of enzymes that play a role in signal transduction across the cellular membrane. The vast majority of HKs are homodimers that exhibit autokinase, phosphotransfer, and phosphatase activity. HKs can act as cellular receptors for signaling molecules in a way analogous to tyrosine kinase receptors (RTK). Multifunctional receptor molecules such as HKs and RTKs typically have portions on the outside of the cell (extracellular domain) that bind to hormone- or growth factor-like molecules, portions that span the cell membrane (transmembrane domain), and portions within the cell (intracellular domain) that contain the enzymatic activity. In addition to kinase activity, the intracellular domains typically have regions that bind to a secondary effector molecule or complex of molecules that further propagate signal transduction within the cell. Distinct from other classes of protein kinases, HKs are usually parts of a two-component signal transduction mechanisms in which HK transfers a phosphate group from ATP to a histidine residue within the kinase, and then to an aspartate residue on the receiver domain of a response regulator protein (or sometimes on the kinase itself). More recently, the widespread existence of protein histidine phosphorylation distinct from that of two-component histidine kinases has been recognised in human cells. In marked contrast to Ser, Thr and Tyr phosphorylation, the analysis of phosphorylated Histidine using standard biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches is much more challenging, and special procedures and separation techniques are required for their preservation alongside classical Ser, Thr and Tyr phosphorylation on proteins isolated from human cells.",

Clevers and his team thus showed that \u201cthere is that this TCF transcription factor, there is a small family of them, they occur in every animal on the planet, they are the end point of the signal transcription cascade, and they control virtually every decision in a developing animal. When we realized this we started changing our model systems, we used to work on lymphocytes, and we changed it, first to frogs and flies, drosophila, where the Wnt pathway had been studied by many other people that way we could use assays of those people. We then realized that in mammals Wnt signaling...was not only important in embryos but also crucial in adults, which is novel. And we switched to the gut, we found that one of our knockouts, the TCF4 knockout, one of the four members of that family had no stem cells in the gut. And this is the first link in the literature, this was also a \u201997 paper in Nature Genetics, between Wnt signaling and stem cells in adults. And in that same year we found in a collaboration with Bert Vogelstein that colon cancer comes about by the disregulation of TCF4, and those two phenomena are really linked. So stem cells need TCF4, cancers disregulate TCF4 by mutating a gene upstream in that pathway called APC.\u201d",

Some models use qubits and in this case the first statement is logically extended. Quantum mechanically a qubit is defined as 2 level system with some energy gap. This can sometimes be difficult to implement physically and so we can focus on a particular transition of atomic levels, etc. Whatever the system we choose, we require that the system remain (almost) always in the subspace of these two levels and in doing so we can say it is a well characterised qubit. An example of a system that is not well characterised would be 2 one-electron quantum dots (potential wells where we only allow for single electron occupations). The electron being in one well or the other is properly characterised as a single qubit, however if we consider a state such as formula_1 then this would correspond to a two qubit state. Such a state is not physically allowed (we only permit single electron occupation) and so we cannot say that we have 2 well characterised qubits.",
