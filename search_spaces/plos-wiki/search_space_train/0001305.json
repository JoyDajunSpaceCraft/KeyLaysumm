Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of public health agencies, either on the (inter)national or a local level. Public health staff rely on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of reportable diseases to them. The analysis of aggregate data can show the spread of a disease and is at the core of the specialty of epidemiology. To understand the spread of the vast majority of non-notifiable diseases, data either need to be collected in a particular study, or existing data collections can be mined, such as insurance company data or antimicrobial drug sales for example.",

Brinkman's current research interests center around improving understanding of how microbes evolve and improving computational methods that aid the analysis of microbes and the development of new vaccines, drugs and diagnostics for infectious diseases. Increasingly her methods have been applied for more environmental applications. She is noted for developing PSORTb, the most precise method available for computational protein subcellular localization prediction and the first computational method that exceeded the accuracy of some common high-throughput laboratory methods for such subcellular localization analysis. This method aids the prediction of cell surface and secreted proteins in a bacterial cell that may be suitable drug targets, vaccine components or diagnostics. She has also developed bioinformatics methods that aid the more accurate identification of genomic islands (i.e. IslandViewer) and orthologs (i.e. OrtholugeDB) . Her research has provided new insights into the evolution of pathogens and the role that horizontal gene transfer and genomic islands play. She confirmed the anecdotal assumption that virulence factors (disease-causing genes in pathogens) are disproportionately associated with genomic islands. She was among the first researchers to use whole genome sequencing to aid infectious disease outbreak investigations (\"genomic epidemiology\"), integrating genome sequence data with social network analysis. She was involved in the Pseudomonas Genome Project and is the coordinator of the Pseudomonas Genome Database, a database of Pseudomonas species genomic data and associated annotations that is continually updated. She has also developed databases (i.e. InnateDB and the Allergy and Asthma Portal) to aid more systems-based analysis of immune disorders and the immune response to infections in humans and other animals - databases that have aided the identification of new immune-modulating therapeutics. She has a long-standing interest in bioinformatics training, improving the curation of biological/bioinformatics data, and developing effective bioinformatics data standards and databases. She is a Thomson Reuter's Highly Cited Researcher, a member of national committees and Boards such as the Genome Canada Board of Directors, and has been Research Director for several Genomics projects. She has a growing interest in applying her methods to environmental applications as part of a broader interest in developing approaches for more holistic, sustainable infectious disease control and microbiome conservation - developing approaches that may select less for antimicrobial resistance, improve the tracking of pathogens and their origins, and better factor in the important role of societal changes and the environment in shaping microbiomes",

The data included measures of blood sugar control (glycosolated hemoglobin A1C), cholesterol, and kidney function (serum creatinine and urine protein), and were used to monitor the quality of care at the patient, practice, and population levels. Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention.

The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. Clinical and economic evaluations of the system, including a large randomized clinical trial, demonstrated improvements in adherence to practice guidelines and reductions in the need for emergency department and hospital services as well as total costs per patient.

Contaminated food or water by fecal matter can cause devastating effects and spread with extreme rapidity. They are, of course, not the only types of infection that threaten large gatherings of people. Respiratory infections, sexually transmitted infections, and measles have all been measured as potential infections resulting from mass gatherings. Social gatherings that have been linked to outbreaks include the 1918 Great Pandemic, the Asian Flu Pandemic of 1957, a 1987 outbreak of multi-drug resistant shigellosis in North Carolina that infected over 50% of event attendees, a 1992 outbreak of Campylobacter in the UK, a 1993 Hepatitis A outbreak at a youth camp in Australia, two separate outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis at the 2000 and 2001 Hajj, a 2008 influenza outbreak in Sydney, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (which followed a large Easter gathering in Mexico). Rainey et al. (2016) identified a total of 72 mass-gathering related respiratory outbreaks between 2005 and 2014. Many of these outbreaks led to further outbreaks within the cities that infected individuals returned home to after the events. Particularly the epidemiological consequences of the Hajj are notable because of the range of dissemination that attendees have when they return from the pilgrimage. Infected individuals may return to their homes far from the source of the outbreak, and into communities that are especially vulnerable to a disease not characteristic of that community. Health response teams may be less equipped to manage the spread of the foreign pathogen, and the people may be less knowledgeable about risks and symptoms. Diseases such a tuberculosis have long incubation periods, which creates another obstacle since it separates the point of infection from the start of illness and therefore obscures the connection. Intervention and mitigation are possible for such large events, but involve very expensive and complex measures. Vaccinations are highly effective, but it is extremely costly to attempt to vaccinate large hordes of individuals. In a study of livestock populations, Hu et al., 2013 observed important patterns for vaccination efforts. When deaths from infection occur, or a method of culling is used, social networks will alter and individuals will spread out. Because of this, carefully designed vaccination efforts are significantly more effective and cheaper and must be implemented as fast as possible in order to contain the pathogen. Relatively new methods, such as tracking mobile phone data, have been used to glean information on effective strategies for containment in the situation of mass gatherings. Finger et al. (2016) state \"human mobility is undisputedly one of the main spreading mechanisms of infectious disease\". In their study, cell phone data was used to track the migration of people for the Grand Magal de Touba, a religious pilgrimage event that occurs in Senegal.

The models need to account for how the genetic variability of a pathogen influences a disease in a species, not just general differences in genomic structure. Two, the strength of the analysis will depend on the amount of mutation accumulated since the pathogen was introduced in the system. This is due to many models using amount of mutations as an indicator of CST frequency. Therefore, efforts are focused on estimating either time since introduction or the substitution rate of the marker (from laboratory experiments or genomic comparative analysis).

Schaller and Park (2011) used the term \"the Behavioral Immune System\" to account for observable activities that humans utilize in the face of pathogen threat. Whereas non-human social animals appear to largely rely upon distinctly organized social structures to combat the threat of diseases, it is evident such systems would be strained to apply in most modern human societies. Schaller and Park (2011) describe \"perceptual cues\" that humans use that will trigger aversive behavior toward other individuals. For example, people who appear to be ill may stimulate avoidance behavior in those around them, particularly if the others around them have temporarily suppressed immune systems, Wilson et al., 2003, speculated that gregarious species may invest less overall in their immune functions because so many of the body's resources must go to support somatic growth and competition among mates. One potential explanation, therefore, for human hypersensitivity to the perception of disease threat is that we are left relatively vulnerable by our under-provisioned immune systems. Schaller and Park (2011) also make a connection between the experience of disgust and things that do pose actual threat of pathogen risk, however this \"disgust\" experience has a tendency to be over-applied rather than under-applied in the favor of the individual's health and is therefore triggered by things that resemble disgust-inducing objects or actions. Such research has enormous implications for the explanation of aspects ranging from cultural diet variance to conformity and xenophobia. Schaller and Murray (2008) ran a comparison against research by Grunier et al. (2004) that displayed the variability of the prevalence of pathogens on a geographic scale. Schaller and Murray (2008) found overlap in cultural differences that included food preparation, mate selection and family structure, and sociosexual practices. In regions where infectious disease threat was lower, people trended toward more liberal sexual practices, more extroverted personalities, and less \"self-conscious\" behavior. In the 2011 article \"the Behavioral Immune System\", the authors discuss how avoidance behaviors can also be triggered when an individual witnesses another individual violating social norms, hence a general trend toward ethnocentrism and wariness of foreigners. Especially during times of known pathogenic outbreak, this can be so extreme as to manifest itself in the form of xenophobia. Wu and Chang's 2011 study elucidated trends toward conformity that they believe may have evolved as a protective dynamic against the introduction of contagions.",

While the increasing trend of exhausted land use has been shown to cause various environmental problems, physical human health issues can result as well. Research has shown that many parts of the world affected by land degradation and human interference are experiencing much higher rates of infectious disease. As land degradation increases across the globe, the status of human health is affected by the changing ecological systems that play host to various pathogens. Furthermore, human susceptibility toward infections often increases alongside changes to the environment. By incorporating sustainable living practices into daily life, many forerunners of biological disease can be avoided, thus preventing instances of epidemics or premature death. Current research has not been able to outline definitive cause and effect relationships between land degradation and the microbiology of pathogens, but well known examples of associations between the two are widely known. These include the contraction of tetanus from spores found in soil and water-related diseases caused by agricultural runoff contaminants. Further experimentation and observations must be conducted in Tanzania to establish concrete evidence for this theory.

Data sources can be examined to eliminate duplicate records, to identify under-reporting and missing cases (e.g., census population counts), to create person-oriented health statistics, and to generate disease registries and health surveillance systems. Some cancer registries link various data sources (e.g., hospital admissions, pathology and clinical reports, and death registrations) to generate their registries. Record linkage is also used to create health indicators. For example, fetal and infant mortality is a general indicator of a country's socioeconomic development, public health, and maternal and child services. If infant death records are matched to birth records, it is possible to use birth variables, such as birth weight and gestational age, along with mortality data, such as cause of death, in analyzing the data. Linkages can help in follow-up studies of cohorts or other groups to determine factors such as vital status, residential status, or health outcomes. Tracing is often needed for follow-up of industrial cohorts, clinical trials, and longitudinal surveys to obtain the cause of death and/or cancer.

Currently, there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully automated tracking surveillance system. Automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the amount of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensor, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.",

There are many systems that can be considered as partially observable due to their unknown or partially known structures or the nature of their unknown products and/or partially known results. The impacts of the consumption of genetically modified food (GM) are an example of a system that is only partially observable. The safety of genetically modified foods (GM) products has caused much controversy. Absence of sufficient and reliable information prevents neither certain confidence about the harmlessness of product consumption, nor any certain conclusion to merit a ban for fear of harm. The lack of any reliable or conclusive post-market observation and consumption effects information, make it difficult to establish a global protocol for such products. This paper introduces a model for the analysis of partially observable information from the surveillance of post-market consumption of systems such as genetically modified foods (GM) products. This model uses Markov Chains, paired with a Bayesian updating function to estimate the statistical impacts of surveillance observations and modified surveillance policies. A case study on population health status is used as an illustrative example, which is modeled to demonstrate the impact of policy interventions on simulated data. A cost decision analysis model is also applied to illustrate the impact of policy intervention costs. The model uses a first order Markov chain to estimate the period-over-period change in health status and a Bayesian updating procedure to estimate the population health status based on observations from post-market surveillance. The results show how observation samples can be used to provide information on system changes and improvements.",

Essence is the United States Department of Defense's Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics. Essence's goal is to monitor health data as it becomes available and discover epidemics and similar health concerns before they move out of control. It was created and developed in 1999 by Dr. Michael Lewis, MD, MPH, when he was a resident in the Preventive Medicine residency training program at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland. Originally designed for early detection of bioterrorism attacks in the Washington, DC, area, following the attacks of 9/11/2001, the U.S. Army Surgeon General, LTG James Peake, MD, ordered Jay Mansfield, the information technology specialist responsible for the IT development of ESSENCE, to expand ESSENCE to look globally at the entire DoD military Healthcare System as it was originally designed. Subsequently, ESSENCE has been adopted and adapted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Johns Hopkins University, and numerous health departments around the United States and other countries. The International Society of Disease Surveillance was formed following a May 2000 meeting to present Dr. Lewis' work to surveillance leaders from around the world. ISDS will hold its 12th annual meeting in December 2013.",

The information in the HSEES system was used to plan for emergency events involving hazardous substances (including terrorist attacks). States also used the information to develop policies and programs to strengthen public health and reduce illnesses and deaths that can result from exposure to hazardous substances. For example, states used HSEES data to support legislation addressing the problem of hazardous chemicals at illegal methamphetamine labs. Other states used HSEES data to implement programs designed to minimize exposure to hazardous chemicals and mercury at schools. More than 50 published studies were conducted using HSEES data.",
