The telomeric region of DNA does not code for any protein; it is simply a repeated code on the end region of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. After many divisions, the telomeres reach a critical length and the cell becomes senescent. It is at this point that a cell has reached its Hayflick limit.",

Telomeres are specialized protein\u2013DNA constructs present at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, which prevent them from degradation and end-to-end chromosomal fusion. Introductory biology courses often describe telomeres as a type of chromosomal aglet. Most vertebrate telomeric DNA consists of long (TTAGGG)n repeats of variable length, often around 3-20kb. \"Subtelomeres\" are segments of DNA between telomeric caps and chromatin. Each chromosome has two subtelomeres immediately adjacent to the long (TTAGGG)n repeats. Subtelomeres are considered to be the most distal (farthest from the centromere) region of unique DNA on a chromosome and they are unusually dynamic and variable mosaics of multichromosomal blocks of sequence. The subtelomeres of such diverse species as Humans, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are structurally similar in that they are composed of various repeated elements, but the extent of the subtelomeres and the sequence of the elements vary greatly among organisms. In yeast (\"S. cerevisiae\"), subtelomeres are composed of two domains : the proximal and distal (telomeric) domains. The two domains differ in sequence content and extent of homology to other chromosome ends and they are often separated by a stretch of degenerate telomere repeats (TTAGGG) and an element called 'core X', which is found at all chromosome ends and contains an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) and an ABF1 binding site. The proximal domain is composed of variable interchromosomal duplications (<1-30 kb), this region can contain genes such \"Pho\", \"Mel\", \"Mal\" and open reading frames (ORFs). The distal domain is composed of 0-4 tandem copies of the highly conserved Y' element which contains other ORFs, the number and chromosomal distribution of Y\u2032 elements varies among yeast strains. Between the core X and the Y' element or the core X and TTAGGG sequence there is often a set of 4 'subtelomeric repeats elements' (STR) : STR-A, STR-B, STR-C and STR-D which consists of multiple copies of the vertebrate telomeric motif TTAGGG. This two-domain structure is remarkably similar to the subtelomere structure in human chromosomes 20p, 4q and 18p in which proximal and distal subtelomeric domains are separated by a stretch of degenerate TTAGGG repeats, but, the picture that emerges from studies of the subtelomeres of other human chromosomes indicates that the two-domain model does not apply universally.",

Specifically, telomeric stability is known to be a common occurrence in cancer cells. Along with the telomerase, the shelterin complex, and TERF2 and TERF1 specifically, also have been noted to control the lengths of telomeres formed by these telomerases. Shelterin works to protect telomeres against unsuitable activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as noted in the function section above. TERF2 as part of the shelterin complex, has been known to block the ATM signaling pathways and prevent chromosome end fusion. In cancer cells, TERF2 phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) is a controlling factor in the major pro-oncogenic signaling pathways (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK) that affect telomeric stability. Additionally, when TERF2 was non-phosphorylated in melanoma cells, there was a cell induced DNA damage response, arresting growth and causing tumor reversion. Studies have found that in tumor cells, TERF2 levels are observed to be high, and this raised level of TERF2 contributes to oncogenesis in a variety of ways. This high level of TERF2 decreases the ability to recruit and activate natural killer cells in human tumor cells. One study used a dominant negative form of TERF2, to inhibit TERF2, and found that it could induce a reversion malignant phenotype in human melanoma cells. Therefore, over-expression of TERF2, and therefore blocking of TERF2, induced apoptosis and reduced tumourigenicity in certain cell lines. Additionally, upregulation of TERF2 may be the cause of the establishment and maintenance of short telomeres. These short telomeres increase chromosomal instability, and increase the chances of certain cancers progressing in the body, such as with leukemia. In gastric mucosa tissues, the expression of TERF2 proteins was significantly higher than normal, and this over-expression of TERF2, along with over-expression of TERF1, TIN2, TERT, and BRCA1 protein transposition, may cause a reduction in telomere length, further contributing to multistage carcinogenesis of gastric cancer.",

At Rockefeller University her research focused on identifying proteins associated with telomeres and their role in protecting telomeres from processes of DNA repair. In her first several years she dedicated a long amount of time and resources to identifying the major protein components of human telomeres. In 1995, she identified and purified the Telomeric-repeat binding factor protein 1 (TRF1). With the assistance of Bas van Steensel, de Lange conducted various studies on proteins associated with telomeres. She found that TRF1 is crucial in the regulation of the length of telomeres. In her research, she proposed that TRF1 inhibits the action of telomerase. Telomerase is an RNA dependent DNA polymerase that can elongate telomeres and is essential in the maintenance of telomeric DNA. Telomerase can counteract the shortening of telomeres, which occurs during the DNA replication process. They also discovered the protein TRF2 and found that it prevents the end-to-end fusing of telomeres, in addition to other functions. One of Titia's major discoveries was the discovery of the t-loop structure of telomeres in her collaboration with Jack Griffith. This was shown through electron microscopy demonstrating that linear telomeric DNA can be remodeled by TRF2 into duplex loops (t loops). This architectural change allows for TRF2 to sequester the ends of telomeres, which function to safeguard telomeres by covering overhanging single strands of DNA. This mechanism protects against the improper activation of DNA damage checkpoints by natural chromosome ends. Previous research had observed that in addition to protecting the ends of chromosomes, telomeric complexes also allow cells to distinguish random DNA breaks and natural chromosome ends.",

Patients with Werner syndrome lose the RecQ helicase activity in the WRN protein because of the loss of its C-terminus region, but the mechanism by which this happens is unclear. The loss of the helicase activity can have far-reaching consequences in terms of cell stability and mutation. One instance of these consequences involves telomeres. It is thought that the WRN helicase activity is important not only for DNA repair and recombination, but also for maintaining telomere length and stability. Thus, WRN helicase is important for preventing catastrophic telomere loss during DNA replication. In a normal cell, the telomeres (the ends of chromosomes) undergo repeated shortening during the cell cycle, which can prevent the cell from dividing and multiplying. This event can be counteracted by telomerase, an enzyme that extends the ends of the chromosomes by copying the telomeres and synthesizing an identical, but new end that can be added to the existing chromosome. However, patients with Werner syndrome often exhibit accelerated telomere shortening, indicating that there may be a connection between the loss of the WRN helicase activity and telomere and cell instability.

Sabatier et al. found that rearrangements involving telomere regions are associated with chromosomal instability in human fibroblasts that occur many generations after exposure to accelerated heavy ions. Telomere dysfunction plays a crucial role in initiating or sustaining genomic instability, which is a major step in cancer progression. Heavy-ion-induced effects on telomere stability have also been studied using siRNA (small interfering ribonucleic acid) knockdown for components of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in human lymphoblasts. Differential results were found for gamma rays and HZE nuclei, with iron nuclei being much more effective in producing DSB-telomere fusions after knockdown of DNA-PK. Cells containing telomere-deficient chromosomes will either senesce or undergo breakage-fusion-bridge (B/F/B) cycles, thereby promoting genetic instability.

Telomeres are specialized protein\u2013DNA constructs present at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, which prevent them from degradation and end-to-end chromosomal fusion. Introductory biology courses often describe telomeres as a type of chromosomal aglet. Most vertebrate telomeric DNA consists of long (TTAGGG)n repeats of variable length, often around 3-20kb. \"Subtelomeres\" are segments of DNA between telomeric caps and chromatin. Each chromosome has two subtelomeres immediately adjacent to the long (TTAGGG)n repeats. Subtelomeres are considered to be the most distal (farthest from the centromere) region of unique DNA on a chromosome and they are unusually dynamic and variable mosaics of multichromosomal blocks of sequence. The subtelomeres of such diverse species as Humans, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are structurally similar in that they are composed of various repeated elements, but the extent of the subtelomeres and the sequence of the elements vary greatly among organisms. In yeast (\"S. cerevisiae\"), subtelomeres are composed of two domains : the proximal and distal (telomeric) domains. The two domains differ in sequence content and extent of homology to other chromosome ends and they are often separated by a stretch of degenerate telomere repeats (TTAGGG) and an element called 'core X', which is found at all chromosome ends and contains an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) and an ABF1 binding site. The proximal domain is composed of variable interchromosomal duplications (<1-30 kb), this region can contain genes such \"Pho\", \"Mel\", \"Mal\" and open reading frames (ORFs). The distal domain is composed of 0-4 tandem copies of the highly conserved Y' element which contains other ORFs, the number and chromosomal distribution of Y\u2032 elements varies among yeast strains. Between the core X and the Y' element or the core X and TTAGGG sequence there is often a set of 4 'subtelomeric repeats elements' (STR) : STR-A, STR-B, STR-C and STR-D which consists of multiple copies of the vertebrate telomeric motif TTAGGG. This two-domain structure is remarkably similar to the subtelomere structure in human chromosomes 20p, 4q and 18p in which proximal and distal subtelomeric domains are separated by a stretch of degenerate TTAGGG repeats, but, the picture that emerges from studies of the subtelomeres of other human chromosomes indicates that the two-domain model does not apply universally.",

At Rockefeller University her research focused on identifying proteins associated with telomeres and their role in protecting telomeres from processes of DNA repair. In her first several years she dedicated a long amount of time and resources to identifying the major protein components of human telomeres. In 1995, she identified and purified the Telomeric-repeat binding factor protein 1 (TRF1). With the assistance of Bas van Steensel, de Lange conducted various studies on proteins associated with telomeres. She found that TRF1 is crucial in the regulation of the length of telomeres. In her research, she proposed that TRF1 inhibits the action of telomerase. Telomerase is an RNA dependent DNA polymerase that can elongate telomeres and is essential in the maintenance of telomeric DNA. Telomerase can counteract the shortening of telomeres, which occurs during the DNA replication process. They also discovered the protein TRF2 and found that it prevents the end-to-end fusing of telomeres, in addition to other functions. One of Titia's major discoveries was the discovery of the t-loop structure of telomeres in her collaboration with Jack Griffith. This was shown through electron microscopy demonstrating that linear telomeric DNA can be remodeled by TRF2 into duplex loops (t loops). This architectural change allows for TRF2 to sequester the ends of telomeres, which function to safeguard telomeres by covering overhanging single strands of DNA. This mechanism protects against the improper activation of DNA damage checkpoints by natural chromosome ends. Previous research had observed that in addition to protecting the ends of chromosomes, telomeric complexes also allow cells to distinguish random DNA breaks and natural chromosome ends.",

Telomerase is a two component enzyme (RNA and protein components) that maintains telomere length, which protects the ends of all chromosomes from damage or dysfunction. Since telomere length tends to shorten with age in humans leading to cellular senescence, telomerase was a potential key factor in promoting human aging from human cancer cells that led to the successful cloning of the first human telomerase gene in early 1994. Following the RNA component of telomerase cloning, Villeponteau worked on Telomerase Therapeutics at Geron. He helped with the cloning effort that eventually identified the protein component of human telomerase in mid-1997. For the successful human RNA telomerase cloning effort, Villeponteau was the senior scientist in the team of four Geron scientists that won the 1997 Distinguished Inventor Award in Washington DC. His subsequent work at Geron provided more evidence that telomeres and telomerase are significant factors in human aging. Geron\u2019s academic collaborators Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider later shared the 2009 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine with Jack Szostak for their early discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase. In 1997 Villeponteau proposed the Heterochromatin Loss Model Of Aging, which proposed that the epigenetics of heterochromatin structure plays an important role in aging. Heterchromatin is a repressor of gene expression and its loss leads to inappropriate gene expression with senescence. The model suggests that heterochromatin provides a fundamental epigenetic mechanism that underlies most of the changes in gene expression in senescence. Recent research in Drosophila has supported this heterochromatin loss model and suggest that heterochromatin loss with age may be a unifying theory of aging",

This protein is present at telomeres throughout the cell cycle and functions as an inhibitor of telomerase, acting in cis to limit the elongation of individual chromosome ends. It is known to protect telomeres in mammals from DNA mechanisms that are used for repair purposes and at the same time regulate the activity carried out by telomerase. The telomeric repeat binding factor 1 protein is present at telomeres, where the cells aging aspect is monitored, throughout the typical cell cycle process. The progressive loss of the telomeric ends of chromosomes is an important mechanism in the timing of human cellular aging. Telomeric Repeat Factor 1 (TRF1) is a protein that binds at telomere ends.",

Although TPP1 was originally described as a bridging factor between TRF1 and TRF2, which participate in a pathway with POT1 as a negative regulator of telomerase-dependent telomere length control, more recent studies suggest that TPP1 could directly promotes telomerase activity at the telomere. A part of the TPP1 oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold named TEL patch that interacts with the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT, has been proven essential for telomerase activation.

The MRN complex's biological role in telomere maintenance has prompted research linking MRN to cancer cell immortality. In human HNSCC cell lines, disruption of the Nbs1 gene (which downregulates expression of the entire MRN complex), has resulted in reduced telomere length and persistent lethal DNA damage in these cells. When combined with treatment of PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitor (known as PARPi), these cells showed an even greater reduction in telomere length, arresting tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo via mouse models grafted with various HNSCC cell lines. While treatment with PARPi alone has been known to induce apoptosis in BRCA mutated cancer cell lines, this study shows that MRN downregulation can sensitize BRCA-proficient cells (those not possessing BRCA mutations) to treatment with PARPi, offering an alternative way to control tumor aggression.",

MRN participates in telomere maintenance primarily via association with the TERF2 protein of the shelterin complex. Additional studies have suggested that Nbs1 is a necessary component protein for telomere elongation by telomerase. Additionally, knockdown of MRN has been shown to significantly reduce the length of the G-overhang at human telomere ends, which could inhibit the proper formation of the so-called T-loop, destabilizing the telomere as a whole. Interestingly, telomere lengthening in cancer cells by the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism has also been shown to be dependent on MRN, especially on the Nbs1 subunit.

Telomere length varies greatly between species, from approximately 300 base pairs in yeast to many kilobases in humans, and usually is composed of arrays of guanine-rich, six- to eight-base-pair-long repeats.

Multiple proteins binding single- and double-stranded telomere DNA have been identified. These function in both telomere maintenance and capping. Telomeres form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle, stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA, and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.",

There have, on the other hand, also been reports that cloning could alter the shortening of telomeres. Some cells do not age and are, therefore, described as being \"biologically immortal\".

One documented autosomal recessive mutation in a family that carries DKC has been found in Nop10. Specifically, the mutation is a change of base from cytosine to thymine in a highly conserved region of the Nop10 sequence. This mutation, on chromosome 15, results in an amino acid change from arginine to tryptophan. Homozygous recessive individuals show the symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita in full. As compared to age-matched normal individuals, those suffering from DKC have telomeres of a much shorter length. Furthermore, heterozygotes, those who have one normal allele and one coding for the disease, also show relatively shortened telomeres. The cause of this was determined to be a reduction in TERC levels in those with the Nop10 mutation. With TERC levels down, telomere maintenance, especially in development, would be presumed to suffer accordingly. This would lead to the telomere shortening described.",
