In addition to humans and flies, some plants also make use of the XX/XY dosage compensation systems. \"Silene latifolia\" plants are also either male (XY) or female (XX), with the Y chromosome being smaller, with fewer genes expressed, than the X chromosome. Two separate studies have shown male \"S. latifolia\" expression of X-linked genes to be about 70% of the expression in females. If the \"S. latifolia\" did not practice dosage compensation, the expected level of X-linked gene expression in males would be 50% that of females, thus the plant practices some degree of dosage compensation but, because male expression is not 100% that of females, it has been suggested that \"S. latiforia\" and its dosage compensation system is still evolving. Additionally, in plant species that lack dimorphic sex chromosomes, dosage compensation can occur when aberrant meiotic events or mutations result in either aneuploidy or polyploidy. Genes on the affected chromosome may be upregulated or down-regulated to compensate for the change in the normal number of chromosomes present.",

For example, in humans, females (XX) silence the transcription of one X chromosome of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome.

As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of \"Drosophila\". However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as \u201cless effective\u201d at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans. Thus, the function of the selective silencing may be to spare dosage compensation of genes crucial for sex determination of homologous pairing.",

Because the entire genome of the platypus has yet to be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds.

X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies.\u00a0 Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called \"sex-lethal\". The gene was named \"sex-lethal\" due to its mutant phenotype which has little to no effect on male flies but results in the death of females due to X hyperactivation of the two X chromosomes. In female \"Drosophila\", the sex-lethal protein causes the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\"gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. This produces a positive feedback loop as the sex-lethal protein splices the \"sex-lethal\" gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. In male \"Drosophila\", there isn\u2019t enough sex-lethal to activate the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\" gene, and it goes through the \"default\" splicing. This means that section of the gene that is spliced out in females remains in males. This portion contains an early stop codon resulting in no protein being made from it. In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the \"male-specific lethal\" (\"msl\") gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The \"msl\" gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the \"msl\" gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the expression of the X chromosome to be \"doubled,\" or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes.",

The ZW sex-determination system is reversed compared to the XY system: females have two different kinds of chromosomes (ZW), and males have two of the same kind of chromosomes (ZZ). In the chicken, this was found to be dependent on the expression of DMRT1. In birds, the genes FET1 and ASW are found on the W chromosome for females, similar to how the Y chromosome contains SRY. However, not all species depend upon the W for their sex. For example, there are moths and butterflies that are ZW, but some have been found female with ZO, as well as female with ZZW. Also, while mammals deactivate one of their extra X chromosomes when female, it appears that in the case of Lepidoptera, the males produce double the normal amount of enzymes, due to having two Z's. Because the use of ZW sex determination is varied, it is still unknown how exactly most species determine their sex. However, reportedly, the silkworm \"Bombyx mori\" uses a single female-specific piRNA as the primary determiner of sex. Despite the similarities between the ZW and XY systems, these sex chromosomes evolved separately. In the case of the chicken, their Z chromosome is more similar to humans' autosome 9. The chicken's Z chromosome also seems to be related to the X chromosome of the platypus. When a ZW species, such as the Komodo dragon, reproduces parthenogenetically, usually only males are produced.

A recent theoretical model raises the possibility of both transitions between the XY/XX and ZZ/ZW system and environmental sex determination The platypus' genes also back up the possible evolutionary link between XY and ZW, because they have the DMRT1 gene possessed by birds on their X chromosomes. Regardless, XY and ZW follow a similar route. All sex chromosomes started out as an original autosome of an original amniote that relied upon temperature to determine the sex of offspring. After the mammals separated, the branch further split into Lepidosauria and Archosauromorpha. These two groups both evolved the ZW system separately, as evidenced by the existence of different sex chromosomal locations. In mammals, one of the autosome pair, now Y, mutated its SOX3 gene into the SRY gene, causing that chromosome to designate sex. After this mutation, the SRY-containing chromosome inverted and was no longer completely homologous with its partner. The regions of the X and Y chromosomes that are still homologous to one another are known as the pseudoautosomal region. Once it inverted, the Y chromosome became unable to remedy deleterious mutations, and thus degenerated.

However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family\u2014maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3\u2014are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread along the length of the chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. The implications of this spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.",

The female cat, therefore, can have the orange mutant gene on one X chromosome and the gene for a black coat on the other. The piebald gene is on a different chromosome. If expressed, this gene codes for white, or no color, and is dominant over the alleles that code for a certain color (\"i.e.\" orange or black), making the white spots on calico cats. If that is the case, those several genes will be expressed in a blotchy coat of the tortoiseshell or calico kind.

X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies.\u00a0 Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called \"sex-lethal\". The gene was named \"sex-lethal\" due to its mutant phenotype which has little to no effect on male flies but results in the death of females due to X hyperactivation of the two X chromosomes. In female \"Drosophila\", the sex-lethal protein causes the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\"gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. This produces a positive feedback loop as the sex-lethal protein splices the \"sex-lethal\" gene to produce more of the sex-lethal protein. In male \"Drosophila\", there isn\u2019t enough sex-lethal to activate the female-specific splicing of the \"sex-lethal\" gene, and it goes through the \"default\" splicing. This means that section of the gene that is spliced out in females remains in males. This portion contains an early stop codon resulting in no protein being made from it. In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the \"male-specific lethal\" (\"msl\") gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The \"msl\" gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the \"msl\" gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the expression of the X chromosome to be \"doubled,\" or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes.",

As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of \"Drosophila\". However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as \u201cless effective\u201d at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans.

The results were that balanced gene expression between X and autosomes gene expression was decreased by 10\u201315% no matter the method of inhibition.

However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family\u2014maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3\u2014are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males.

Females have two X-chromosomes, while males only have a single X chromosome, and a genetic abnormality located on the X chromosome is much more likely to cause clinical disease in a male (who lacks the possibility of having the normal gene present on any other chromosome) than in a female (who is able to compensate for the one abnormal X chromosome).",

The ZW sex-determination system is reversed compared to the XY system: females have two different kinds of chromosomes (ZW), and males have two of the same kind of chromosomes (ZZ). In the chicken, this was found to be dependent on the expression of DMRT1. In birds, the genes FET1 and ASW are found on the W chromosome for females, similar to how the Y chromosome contains SRY. However, not all species depend upon the W for their sex. For example, there are moths and butterflies that are ZW, but some have been found female with ZO, as well as female with ZZW. Also, while mammals deactivate one of their extra X chromosomes when female, it appears that in the case of Lepidoptera, the males produce double the normal amount of enzymes, due to having two Z's. Because the use of ZW sex determination is varied, it is still unknown how exactly most species determine their sex. However, reportedly, the silkworm \"Bombyx mori\" uses a single female-specific piRNA as the primary determiner of sex. Despite the similarities between the ZW and XY systems, these sex chromosomes evolved separately. In the case of the chicken, their Z chromosome is more similar to humans' autosome 9. The chicken's Z chromosome also seems to be related to the X chromosome of the platypus. When a ZW species, such as the Komodo dragon, reproduces parthenogenetically, usually only males are produced. This is due to the fact that the haploid eggs double their chromosomes, resulting in ZZ or WW. The ZZ become males, but the WW are not viable and are not brought to term.",

Skewed X chromosome inactivation occurs when the inactivation of one X chromosome is favored over the other, leading to an uneven number of cells with each chromosome inactivated. It is usually defined as one allele being found on the active X chromosome in over 75% of cells, and extreme skewing is when over 90% of cells have inactivated the same X chromosome. It can be caused by primary nonrandom inactivation, either by chance due to a small cell pool or directed by genes, or caused by secondary nonrandom inactivation, which occurs by selection. Most females will have some levels of skewing. It is relatively common in adult females; around 35% of women have a skewed ratio over 70:30, and 7% of women have an extreme skewed ratio of over 90:10. This is of medical significance due to the potential for the expression of disease genes present on the X chromosome that are normally not expressed due to random X inactivation. X chromosome inactivation occurs in females to provide dosage compensation between the sexes. If females kept both X chromosomes active they would have twice the number of active X genes than males, who only have one copy of the X chromosome. At approximately the time of implantation (see Implantation (human embryo)), one of the two X chromosomes in each cell of the female embryo is randomly selected for inactivation. Cells then undergo transcriptional and epigenetic changes to ensure this inactivation is permanent. All progeny from these initial cells will maintain the inactivation of the same chromosome, resulting in a mosaic pattern of cells in females.",

Although X chromosomes have been considered as hot spots for accumulating sexually antagonistic alleles, other autosomal locations have also been reported to harbor sexually antagonistic alleles.

In case of partial or completely dominant sex linked traits which are detrimental to male, the probability of selecting for the allele would be 2/3 as compared to selecting against probability of 1/3. Considering the above scenario its likely that X and W chromosomes would harbor many sexually antagonistic alleles. However, recently Innocenti \"et al.\" identified sexually antagonistic candidate genes in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" that contributed about 8% of the total genes. These were distributed on X, second and third chromosomes. Accessory gland proteins which are male biased and shows positive selection reside entirely on autosomes. They are partially sexually antagonistic as they are not expressed in females and dominant in nature and hence under represented on X.",

As Sue Hubble stated in her book \"Shrinking the Cat: Genetic Engineering before We Knew about Genes\",  The mutation that gives male cats a ginger-colored coat and females ginger, tortoiseshell, or calico coats produced a particularly telling map. The orange mutant gene is found only on the X, or female, chromosome. As with humans, female cats have paired sex chromosomes, XX, and male cats have XY sex chromosomes. The female cat, therefore, can have the orange mutant gene on one X chromosome and the gene for a black coat on the other. The piebald gene is on a different chromosome. If expressed, this gene codes for white, or no color, and is dominant over the alleles that code for a certain color (\"i.e.\" orange or black), making the white spots on calico cats. If that is the case, those several genes will be expressed in a blotchy coat of the tortoiseshell or calico kind. But the male, with his single X chromosome, has only one of that particular coat-color gene: he can be not-ginger or he can be ginger (although some modifier genes can add a bit of white here and there), but unless he has a chromosomal abnormality he cannot be a calico cat. It is currently impossible to reproduce the fur patterns of calico cats by cloning. Penelope Tsernoglou wrote \"This is due to an effect called x-linked inactivation which involves the random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes. Since all female mammals have two X chromosomes, one might wonder if this phenomenon could have a more widespread impact on cloning in the future.\"",

A recent theoretical model raises the possibility of both transitions between the XY/XX and ZZ/ZW system and environmental sex determination The platypus' genes also back up the possible evolutionary link between XY and ZW, because they have the DMRT1 gene possessed by birds on their X chromosomes. Regardless, XY and ZW follow a similar route. All sex chromosomes started out as an original autosome of an original amniote that relied upon temperature to determine the sex of offspring. After the mammals separated, the branch further split into Lepidosauria and Archosauromorpha. These two groups both evolved the ZW system separately, as evidenced by the existence of different sex chromosomal locations. In mammals, one of the autosome pair, now Y, mutated its SOX3 gene into the SRY gene, causing that chromosome to designate sex. After this mutation, the SRY-containing chromosome inverted and was no longer completely homologous with its partner. The regions of the X and Y chromosomes that are still homologous to one another are known as the pseudoautosomal region. Once it inverted, the Y chromosome became unable to remedy deleterious mutations, and thus degenerated. There is some concern that the Y chromosome will shrink further and stop functioning in ten million years: but the Y chromosome has been strictly conserved after its initial rapid gene loss.",
