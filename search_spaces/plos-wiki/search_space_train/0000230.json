Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin, a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, known medically as hemochromatosis. Many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload, and are not aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor.

Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE is only part of the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.",

As the environments of most organisms are constantly changing, the reactions of metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the \"regulation\" of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the \"control\" exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (\"i.e.\" it is highly regulated) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway. There are multiple levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates to respond to changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.",

These iron-siderophore complexes, however, are not specific. The bacterium that produced the siderophores does not necessarily receive the direct benefit of iron intake. Rather, all members of the cellular population are equally likely to access the iron-siderophore complexes. Members of the cellular population that can efficiently produce these siderophores are commonly referred to as cooperators; members that produce little to no siderophores are often referred to as cheaters. Research has shown when cooperators and cheaters are grown together, cooperators have a decrease in fitness, while cheaters have an increase in fitness. The magnitude of change in fitness increases with increasing iron limitation. With an increase in fitness, the cheaters can outcompete the cooperators; this leads to an overall decrease in fitness of the group, due to lack of sufficient siderophore production. These observations suggest that having a mix of cooperators and cheaters can reduce the virulent nature of \"P. aeruginosa\".",

            "document": "Iron overload . Two factors are thought to have had large influence on the mutation of genes related to Iron overload during the Stone Age: diet and the environment. Starting during the Mesolithic Era, communities of people lived in an environment that was fairly sunny, warm and had the dry climates of the Middle East. Most of the humans who lived at the time were foragers and their diets consisted mostly of hunting game, gathering and even fishing when and if the opportunity arose. With the archaeologists studying dental plaque and the assumptions of what would have been available to the people due to their environment, leads to the theories of Mesolithic foragers eating substances such as tubers, nuts, plantains, grass and much of the food would have been was very rich in iron. Over hundreds of years the body was very well adapted to the high level of iron content in the consumption. Moving forward in time and studying the Neolithic Era, which was during the end of the Stone Age, we see serious advancements in both the environment and diet of the travelling people. During the European Neolithic era, some communities of foragers started to migrate north. The lifestyle and environment started to change to a decrease in temperatures and a change in the landscaping in which the foragers now needed to adapt to. As the people began to develop and advance their use of tools and learn new ways of producing food, hunting and gathering was no longer the main source, but farming also slowly started to develop. The change that the travellers encountered would have lead to serious stress on the body and a decrease in iron rich consumption. This transition is a key factor in which researchers can start to see the link between the travellers diets, environment & the mutations of genes, especially those that regulated the iron absorption within the body. The iron, that makes of 70% of our red blood cell composition, \u00a0is a critical micronutrient for effective thermoregulation in the body. When the body encounters a deficiency of its micronutrients, in this case iron, it will lead to a drop in the core temperature. When the travellers encountered the much more chilly & damp environments of Europe, the supplementary iron from there food was a necessity to help keep their temperatures regulated- however, without the iron supplements from the food the human body would have undergone serious stress to make up for the lost iron and would have started to store iron at higher rates than normal. This theory hypothesizes that the pressures cause by the migration would be the initiation to the gene mutation that allowed the body to absorb & store higher amounts of iron. There is no way to know the exact time at which the gene mutated or in which location these people were in when it happened. However, when the time frame at which the migrators would have started to move north and the increasing probability of the people\u2019s bodies adapting, lead to the assumption that the travellers would have moved and helped to develop the Celtic Empire during the Bronzing Age. This theory would also offer an explanation of why the name \u2018Celtic Curse\u2019 became a well known alternative/nickname for hemochromatosis.",

Iron chelation is a medical therapy that avoids the complications of iron overload.

Every unit of transfused blood contains 200\u2013250\u00a0mg of iron and the body has no natural mechanism to remove excess iron. Deferasirox is a vital part in the patients health after blood transfusions. During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to transferrin, but with an iron overload, the ability for transferrin to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received Deferasirox experienced no drug-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which was present with other iron chelators. Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation.

A working model describes the defect in the HFE gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE is only part of the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.",

            "document": "Hemojuvelin . Mutations in HJV are responsible for the vast majority of juvenile hemochromatosis patients. A small number of patients have mutations in the hepcidin (HAMP) gene. The gene was positionally cloned. Hemojuvelin is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, and to a lesser extent in the liver. One insight into the pathogenesis of juvenile hemochromatosis is that patients have low to undetectable urinary hepcidin levels, suggesting that hemojuvelin is a positive regulator of hepcidin, the central iron regulatory hormone. As a result, low hepcidin levels would result in increased intestinal iron absorption. Thus, HJV/RGMc appears to play a critical role in iron metabolism.",

            "document": "Hepcidin . \u03b2-thalassemia, one of the most common congenital anemias, arises from partial or complete lack of \u03b2-globin synthesis. Excessive iron absorption is one of the main features of \u03b2-thalassemia and can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. The serial analyses of \u03b2-thalassemic mice indicate hemoglobin levels decreases over time, while the concentration of iron in the liver, spleen, and kidneys markedly increases. The overload of iron is associated with low levels of hepcidin. Patients with \u03b2-thalassemia also have low hepcidin levels. The observations led researchers to hypothesize that more iron is absorbed in \u03b2-thalassemia than is required for erythropoiesis. Increasing expression of hepcidin in \u03b2-thalassemic mice limits iron overload, and also decreases formation of insoluble membrane-bound globins and reactive oxygen species, and improves anemia. Mice with increased hepcidin expression also demonstrated an increase in the lifespan of their red cells, reversal of ineffective erythropoiesis and splenomegaly, and an increase in total hemoglobin levels. From these data, researchers suggested that therapeutics to increase hepcidin levels or act as hepcidin agonists could help treat the abnormal iron absorption in individuals with \u03b2-thalassemia and related disorders. In later studies in mice, erythroferrone has been suggested to be the factor that is responsible for the hepcidin suppression. Correcting hepcidin and iron levels in these mice did not improve their anemia.",

            "document": "Iron overload . Blood tests are usually the first test if there is a clinical suspicion of iron overload. Serum ferritin testing is a low-cost, readily available, and minimally invasive method for assessing body iron stores. However, the major problem with using it as an indicator of iron overload is that it can be elevated in a range of other medical conditions unrelated to iron levels including infection, inflammation, fever, liver disease, kidney disease, and cancer. Also, total iron binding capacity may be low, but can also be normal. Serum ferritin: In males and postmenopausal females, a serum ferritin value of over 300\u00a0ng/mL (670 pmol/L) indicates iron overload. In premenopausal females, a serum ferritin value of over 150 or 200 ng/mL (330 or 440 pmol/L) indicates iron overload. If the person is capable of showing the symptoms, they may need to be tested more than once throughout their lives as a precautionary, most commonly in women after menopause. Transferrin saturation is a more specific test.",

In contrast to iron uptake and recycling, there is no physiologic regulatory mechanism for excreting iron. People lose a small but steady amount by gastrointestinal blood loss, sweating and by shedding cells of the skin and the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract. The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of a day for men, and 1.5\u20132\u00a0mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People with gastrointestinal parasitic infections, more commonly found in developing countries, often lose more. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of iron overload. In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.",

            "document": "Human iron metabolism . In response to a systemic bacterial infection, the immune system initiates a process known as iron withholding. If bacteria are to survive, then they must obtain iron from their environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called siderophores and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a metabolic price they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against most bacterial infections; there are some exceptions however. TB causing bacterium can reside within macrophages which are an iron rich environment and Borrelia burgdorferi utilises manganese in place of iron. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with hemochromatosis, are more susceptible to some bacterial infection.",
