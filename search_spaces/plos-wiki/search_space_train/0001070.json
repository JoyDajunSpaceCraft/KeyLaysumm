The interactomes based on PPIs should be associated to the proteome of the corresponding species in order to provide a global view (\"omic\") of all the possible molecular interactions that a protein can present. The word \"interactome\" was originally coined in 1999 by a group of French scientists headed by Bernard Jacq. Mathematically, interactomes are generally displayed as graphs. Though interactomes may be described as biological networks, they should not be confused with other networks such as neural networks or food webs.",

This connectivity allows Hsp90 to function as a network hub linking diverse protein interaction networks. Within these networks Hsp90 primarily specializes in maintaining and regulating proteins involved in signal transduction or information processing. These include transcription factors that initiate gene expression, kinases that transmit information by post-translationally modifying other proteins and E3-ligases that target proteins for degradation via the proteosome. Indeed, a recent study utilizing the LUMIER method has shown that human Hsp90B interacts with 7% of all transcription factors, 60% of all kinases and 30% of all E3-ligases. Other studies have shown that Hsp90 interacts with various structural proteins, ribosomal components and metabolic enzymes. Hsp90 has also been found to interact with a large number of viral proteins including those from HIV and EBOLA.

In addition, a large number of pathway analytic methods exploit pathway knowledge in public repositories such as Gene Ontology (GO) or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), rather than inferring pathways from molecular measurements. Furthermore, different research focuses have given the word \"pathway\" different meanings. For example, 'pathway' can denote a metabolic pathway involving a sequence of enzyme-catalyzed reactions of small molecules, or a signaling pathway involving a set of protein phosphorylation reactions and gene regulation events. Therefore, the term \"pathway analysis\" has a very broad application. For instance, it can refer to the analysis physical interaction networks (e.g., protein\u2013protein interactions), kinetic simulation of pathways, and steady-state pathway analysis (e.g., flux-balance analysis), as well as its usage in the inference of pathways from expression and sequence data. Several functional enrichment analysis tools and algorithms have been developed to enhance data interpretation. The existing knowledge base\u2013driven pathway analysis methods in each generation have been summarized in recent literature.",

Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP) is involved in a wide range of molecular interactions with biological and nonbiological partners of various chemical compositions such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or small molecules. TCTP is therefore an important and versatile binding platform. Many of these protein\u2013protein interactions have been validated, albeit only few received an in-depth structural characterization. In TCTP/tpt1 - Remodeling Signaling from Stem Cell to Disease, focus is on the structural analysis of TCTP and the review of the available literature regarding its interaction network from a structural perspective.",

The total complement of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome.

Conversely, the three-dimensional structure is compatible with a large, but limited set of amino acid sequences. Enumerating the allowed sequences for a given fold is known as the 'inverse protein folding problem'. We are working to solve this problem for a large number of known protein folds (a representative subset: about 1500 folds). The most expensive step is to build a database of energy functions that describe all these structures. For each structure, we consider all possible sequences of amino acids. Surprisingly, this is computationally tractable, because our energy functions are sums over pairs of interactions. Once this is done, we can explore the space of amino acid sequences in a fast and efficient way, and retain the most favorable sequences. This large-scale mapping of protein sequence space will have applications for predicting protein structure and function, for understanding protein evolution, and for designing new proteins. By joining the project, you will help to build the database of energy functions and advance an important area of science with potential biomedical applications.\"",

ProBiS software started as ProBiS algorithm that detects structurally similar sites on protein surfaces by local surface structure alignment using a fast maximum clique algorithm. The ProBiS algorithm was followed by ProBiS server which provides access to the program ProBiS that detects protein binding sites based on local structural alignments. There are two ProBiS servers available, ProBiS server and ProBiS CHARMMing server. The latter connects ProBiS and CHARMMing servers into one functional unit that enables prediction of protein\u2212ligand complexes and allows for their geometry optimization and interaction energy calculation. The ProBiS CHARMMing server with these additional functions can only be used at National Institutes of Health, USA. Otherwise it acts as a regular ProBiS server. Additionally a ProBiS PyMOL plugin and ProBiS UCSF Chimera plugin have been made. Both plugins are connected via the internet to a newly prepared database of pre-calculated binding site comparisons to allow fast prediction of binding sites in existing proteins from the Protein Data Bank. They enable viewing of predicted binding sites and ligands poses in three-dimensional graphics.",

The current version also includes a pipeline for the discovery and annotation of novel domain-motif interactions. For every interaction 3did identifies and groups different binding modes by clustering similar interfaces into \u201cinteraction topologies\u201d. By maintaining a constantly updated collection of domain-based structural interaction templates, 3did is a reference source of information for the structural characterization of protein interaction networks. 3did is updated every six months and is available for bulk download and for browsing at http://3did.irbbarcelona.org.",

Power graph analysis is a method for simplifying complex biological networks by finding cliques and related structures in these networks.",

On a molecular level, amino acid residues at different locations of a protein may evolve non-independently because they have a direct physicochemical interaction, or indirectly by their interactions with a common substrate or through long-range interactions in the protein structure. Conversely, the folded structure of a protein could potentially be inferred from the distribution of residue interactions. One of the earliest applications of ancestral reconstruction, to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein through residue contacts, was published by Shindyalov and colleagues. Phylogenies relating 67 different protein families were generated by a distance-based clustering method (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, UPGMA), and ancestral sequences were reconstructed by parsimony. The authors reported a weak but significant tendency for co-evolving pairs of residues to be co-located in the known three-dimensional structure of the proteins.",

Publicly available information from biomedical documents is readily accessible through the internet and is becoming a powerful resource for collecting known protein-protein interactions (PPIs), PPI prediction and protein docking. Text mining is much less costly and time-consuming compared to other high-throughput techniques. Currently, text mining methods generally detect binary relations between interacting proteins from individual sentences using rule/pattern-based information extraction and machine learning approaches. A wide variety of text mining applications for PPI extraction and/or prediction are available for public use, as well as repositories which often store manually validated and/or computationally predicted PPIs. Text mining can be implemented in two stages: \"information retrieval\", where texts containing names of either or both interacting proteins are retrieved and \"information extraction,\" where targeted information (interacting proteins, implicated residues, interaction types, etc.) is extracted.",
