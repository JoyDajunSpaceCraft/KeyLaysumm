            "document": "Pilsicainide . Pilsicainide is a drug used clinically in Japan to treat cardiac arrhythmias. It functions by blocking the fast inward movement of sodium ions through the Nav1.5 sodium channel that contributes to the rapid depolarization characteristic of phase 0 in the cardiac action potential. Pilsicainide is a pure sodium channel blocker, meaning it does not significantly affect any other cardiac channels including potassium and calcium channels. Pilsicainide binds to a common site on the sodium channel through either intracellular or extracellular application(3). The affinity of pilsicainide for the sodium channel receptor and its rate of binding are dependent on the state of the channel. It has been proven to have a greater affinity for the receptor in its inactivated state as opposed to resting or open(4), thereby following the modulated receptor hypothesis(5). Binding of pilsicainide selectively inhibits the channel(6), preventing the movement of sodium ions into the cardiac cell. This decreases the rate of depolarization of the cell membrane as well as the action potential amplitude, but has no effect on the overall duration of the action potential(6). Suppression of the depolarization rate is use-dependent(7), and therefore inhibition increases with increased stimulation. Pilsicainide also causes delayed impulse conduction through the myocardium in a dose-dependent manner(8). The effects of pilsicainide have a slow rate of onset and offset resulting in a prolonged recovery time(9). This contributes to its potent blocking activity and its classification as a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent(10). A cardiac arrhythmia includes any abnormal heartbeat and can be manifested as tachycardia, bradycardia, or other irregular rhythms. Pilsicainide has been proven successful in treating both ventricular(11) and supraventricular arrhythmias with few adverse effects(12). It is especially effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia(14). It may result from various heart abnormalities or may occur spontaneously in a seemingly healthy individual(15). Atrial fibrillation is characterized by rapid, disorganized electrical impulses in the atria resulting in depolarization of only a small group of myocardial cells. This prevents the atria from undergoing coordinated contraction, instead resulting in small fibrillations of the heart muscle. Re-entry occurs when an impulse does not die after activating the heart but instead returns to the atria and causes re-excitation(16). Simultaneous re-entry of multiple impulses with short wavelengths results in atrial fibrillation(17). Impulse wavelength is the product of the conduction velocity and the effective refractory period. Pilsicainide suppresses atrial conduction velocity but also increases the effective refractory period(18). Its effects on the refractory period are significantly more substantial, and therefore pilsicainide treatment results in an increased wavelength and termination of atrial fibrillation. A single oral dose of pilsicainide effectively restores normal sinus rhythm in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and a healthy left ventricle. Long-term therapy with pilsicainide is successful in treating chronic atrial fibrillation).",

This results in an increased intracellular concentration of sodium ions and thus a decreased concentration gradient across the cell membrane. This increase in intracellular sodium causes the Na/Ca exchanger to reverse potential, i.e., transition from pumping sodium into the cell in exchange for pumping calcium out of the cell, to pumping sodium out of the cell in exchange for pumping calcium into the cell. This leads to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, which improves cardiac contractility. Under normal physiological conditions, the cytoplasmic calcium used in cardiac contractions originates from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an intracellular organelle that specializes in the storage of calcium. Human newborns, some animals, and patients with chronic heart failure lack well developed and fully functioning sarcoplasmic reticula and must rely on the Na/Ca exchanger to provide all or a majority of the cytoplasmic calcium required for cardiac contraction. For this to occur, cytoplasmic sodium must exceed its typical concentration to favor a reversal in potential, which naturally occurs in human newborns and some animals primarily through an elevated heart rate; in patients with chronic heart failure it occurs through the administration of digitalis. As a result of increased contractility, stroke volume is increased. Ultimately, digitalis increases cardiac output (Cardiac Output=Stroke Volume x Heart Rate). This is the mechanism that makes this drug a popular treatment for congestive heart failure, which is characterized by low cardiac output. Digitalis also has a vagal effect on the parasympathetic nervous system, and as such is used in re-entrant cardiac arrhythmias and to slow the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. The dependence on the vagal effect means digitalis is not effective when a patient has a high sympathetic nervous system drive, which is the case with acutely ill persons, and also during exercise.",

Tertiapin binds specifically to different subunits of the inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir), namely GIRK1 (Kir 3.1), GIRK4 (Kir 3.4) and ROMK1 (Kir 1.1), inducing a dose-dependent block of the potassium current. It is thought that tertiapin binds to the Kir channel with its \u03b1-helix situated at the C-terminal of the peptide. This \u03b1-helix is plugged into the external end of the conduction pore, thereby blocking the channel. The N-terminal of the peptide sticks out of the extracellular side. Tertiapin has a high affinity for Kir channels with approximately Kd = 8 nM for GIRK1/4 channels and Kd = 2 nM for ROMK1 channels. In contrast to the voltage-gated K+ channels, Kir channels are more permeable to K during hyperpolarization than during depolarization. A voltage-dependent blockade by intracellular cations at voltages more positive than the K reversal potential is the mechanism underlying this feature. At more negative voltages the Kir channels are responsible for an inward K+ current. Therefore K channels contribute to the maintenance of the resting potential, the duration of the action potential and the neuronal excitability. GIRK1 and -4 are subunits of the muscarinic potassium channels (KACh) and have an important role in the slowing down of the heart rate in response to parasympathetic stimulation via acetylcholine. KAch channels activate during hyperpolarization, prolonging the cardiac action potential by inflow of potassium ions and reducing the frequency of action potential generation. An inhibition by tertiapin will result in a shorter cardiac action potential with loss of parasympathetic control, resulting in a faster heart rate ROMK is found in the kidneys where it contributes to K recycling. An inhibition will result in loss of potassium, as observed in Bartter syndrome, which can be caused by mutations in the ROMK channels.",

The funny current is highly expressed in spontaneously active cardiac regions, such as the sinoatrial node (SAN, the natural pacemaker region), the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the Purkinje fibres of conduction tissue. The funny current is a mixed sodium\u2013potassium current that activates upon hyperpolarization at voltages in the diastolic range (normally from \u221260/\u221270 mV to \u221240 mV). When, at the end of a sinoatrial action potential, the membrane repolarizes below the I threshold (about \u221240/\u221250 mV), the funny current is activated and supplies inward current, which is responsible for starting the diastolic depolarization phase (DD); by this mechanism, the funny current controls the rate of spontaneous activity of sinoatrial myocytes, and thus the cardiac rate.  Another unusual feature of I is its dual activation by voltage and by cyclic nucleotides. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) molecules bind directly to f-channels and increase their open probability. cAMP dependence is a particularly relevant physiological property, since it underlies the I-dependent autonomic regulation of heart rate. Sympathetic stimulation raises the level of cAMP-molecules which bind to f-channels and shift the I activation range to more positive voltages; this mechanism leads to an increase of the current at diastolic voltages and therefore to an increase of the steepness of DD and heart rate acceleration. Parasympathetic stimulation (which acts to increase probability of potassium channels opening but decreases the probability of calcium channel opening) decreases the heart rate by the opposite action, that is by shifting the I activation curve towards more negative voltages. When vagally-released acetylcholine (ACh) binds to muscarinic M2 receptors, which promotes dissociation of \u03b2\u03b3 subunit complexes, leading to direct opening of the G-protein\u2013gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Girk/Kir) \"IKACh.\"",

Both atrial and ventricular repolarization is lengthened by tedisamil by blocking multiple potassium channels including the transient outward (Ito), the adenosine triphosphate-dependent (IK-ATP), and the delayed rectifier potassium currents (IKr and IKs). Tedisamil action is dose dependent as currents are blocked longer and more effectively at higher concentrations. Tedisamil activity is greatest on Ito and acts by binding to the channel in its open configuration. This produces a blocked state and delays its inactivation. To restore normal function, tedisamil must unbind from the channel so that it can inactivate and eventually reopen. Similar mechanisms have been observed on the IKr and IKs currents. In both Ito and delayed rectifier channels, the tedisamil binding site appears to be internal as both binding and unbinding occur more effectively when tedisamil is applied inside the cell. Tedisamil also appears to provide specific, single channel blocking of IK-ATP at high concentrations. As the potassium channels are responsible for restoring the resting membrane potential during an action potential, lengthening their inactivation will stop the cycle of fibrillation by preventing muscle contraction until all ion channels are available to open.

Other inward currents that help generate intrinsic spiking and bursting in pacemaker neurons are the calcium current and calcium-activated nonspecific currents (I). When a neuron becomes depolarized, voltage gated calcium channels become activated and calcium is able to flow into the cell which usually leads to the release of neurotransmitters. Calcium-sensitive dyes have shown that internal concentrations of calcium increase during bursts. The activation of different calcium channels has distinct effects on the activity of neurons in the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex. L-type calcium channels are known to increase the frequency of action potentials in some neurons, which might be the reason calcium influx through these channels has been observed during the augmentation when tissues have low levels of oxygen. P/Q-type calcium channels are mainly responsible for the release of neurotransmitters that excite, or activate, postsynaptic neurons. Studies have shown that blockage of these channels leads to the inhibition of sighs, which indicates calcium flow through these channels is necessary for sighs. Other research has also suggested that calcium flow through N-type calcium channels is essential for normal breathing, and is responsible for the activation of calcium-dependent potassium channels. Calcium-activated nonselective cation currents are important for the intrinsic spiking and bursting activity in CS pacemaker neurons. Metabotropic glutamate 1/5 receptors appear to be important for the increase in intracellular calcium that activate I. The initial burst in a neuron usually leads to the activation of the transient sodium current and the several types of calcium currents.These currents depolarize the cell further enough to activate NMDA receptors and I, which helps cell regenerate its bursts. The ratio between inward and outward currents helps determine the activity of pacemaker neurons in the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex. The major outward currents involved in the regulation of neuron activity are potassium currents. Although the exact role of potassium currents is still being investigated, it appears that potassium and sodium leak currents are crucial for the rhythmicity of the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex. Transient A-type potassium currents are more common in neurons that are involved in the inspiration process. When A-type potassium currents were blocked with 4-AP in slices of the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex, synchronized bursts in inspiratory neurons was affected as well as communication with hypoglossal motor pools that help regulate breathing. This suggests that transient A-type potassium currents are needed for the synchronized bursts in inspiratory neurons and for effective respiratory control. Other potassium channels like large conductance calcium-dependent potassium channels and sodium chloride dependent potassium channels appear to end burst potentials in neurons. Moreover, ATP-dependent potassium channels help neurons detect changes in energy or oxygen levels to modify breathing patterns. These channels are activated by decreases in ATP, which suggests they provide the needed hyperpolarization during hypoxia.",

DATS is a promising treatment for cardiac arrhythmias through its ability to change the opening of the human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related (hERG) channel. hERG is the pore-forming subunit of potassium channels that create delayed rectifier potassium ion currents in many cells, including cardiac myocytes. The delayed rectifier potassium ion current is largely responsible for the repolarization of ventricular cardiac myocytes by permitting potassium efflux. DATS causes a decrease in the steady-state inactivation, alters deactivation, and impairs trafficking of the hERG channel from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane of the cell. This decreases the amount of functional potassium ion rectifier channels on the cell membrane and thus, slows depolarization. However, hERG trafficking impairment has also been shown to cause arrhythmias due to the development of long QT syndrome and should be considered in drug development.",

This study demonstrated that common pathogenic features of all \"ANK2\" mutations was the abnormal coordination of a panel of related ion channels and transporters.

For example, certain situations of excessive or reduced heart rate (tachycardia or bradycardia, respectively) can cause a BBB known as a rate-dependent bundle branch block (RDBBB). This manifests in a similar fashion to a regular bundle branch block, but occurs only under conditions that affect contractile rate.

Cardiac arrhythmia Cardiac arrhythmia, also known as \"cardiac dysrhythmia\" or \"irregular heartbeat\", is a group of conditions in which the heartbeat is irregular, too fast, or too slow. A heart rate that is too fast \u2013 above 100 beats per minute in adults \u2013 is called tachycardia and a heart rate that is too slow \u2013 below 60 beats per minute \u2013 is called bradycardia. Many types of arrhythmia have no symptoms. When symptoms are present these may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats. More seriously there may be lightheadedness, passing out, shortness of breath, or chest pain. While most types of arrhythmia are not serious, some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure. Others may result in cardiac arrest. There are four main types of arrhythmia: extra beats, supraventricular tachycardias, ventricular arrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias. Extra beats include premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions, and premature junctional contractions. Supraventricular tachycardias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Arrhythmias are due to problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart. Arrhythmias may occur in children; however, the normal range for the heart rate is different and depends on age. A number of tests can help with diagnosis including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter monitor. Most arrhythmias can be effectively treated. Treatments may include medications, medical procedures such as a pacemaker, and surgery. Medications for a fast heart rate may include beta blockers or agents that attempt to restore a normal heart rhythm such as procainamide. This later group may have more significant side effects especially if taken for a long period of time. Pacemakers are often used for slow heart rates.

It functions by blocking the fast inward movement of sodium ions through the Nav1.5 sodium channel that contributes to the rapid depolarization characteristic of phase 0 in the cardiac action potential. Pilsicainide is a pure sodium channel blocker, meaning it does not significantly affect any other cardiac channels including potassium and calcium channels. Pilsicainide binds to a common site on the sodium channel through either intracellular or extracellular application(3). The affinity of pilsicainide for the sodium channel receptor and its rate of binding are dependent on the state of the channel. It has been proven to have a greater affinity for the receptor in its inactivated state as opposed to resting or open(4), thereby following the modulated receptor hypothesis(5). Binding of pilsicainide selectively inhibits the channel(6), preventing the movement of sodium ions into the cardiac cell. This decreases the rate of depolarization of the cell membrane as well as the action potential amplitude, but has no effect on the overall duration of the action potential(6). Suppression of the depolarization rate is use-dependent(7), and therefore inhibition increases with increased stimulation. Pilsicainide also causes delayed impulse conduction through the myocardium in a dose-dependent manner(8). The effects of pilsicainide have a slow rate of onset and offset resulting in a prolonged recovery time(9). This contributes to its potent blocking activity and its classification as a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent(10). A cardiac arrhythmia includes any abnormal heartbeat and can be manifested as tachycardia, bradycardia, or other irregular rhythms. Pilsicainide has been proven successful in treating both ventricular(11) and supraventricular arrhythmias with few adverse effects(12). It is especially effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia(14). It may result from various heart abnormalities or may occur spontaneously in a seemingly healthy individual(15). Atrial fibrillation is characterized by rapid, disorganized electrical impulses in the atria resulting in depolarization of only a small group of myocardial cells. This prevents the atria from undergoing coordinated contraction, instead resulting in small fibrillations of the heart muscle. Re-entry occurs when an impulse does not die after activating the heart but instead returns to the atria and causes re-excitation(16). Simultaneous re-entry of multiple impulses with short wavelengths results in atrial fibrillation(17). Impulse wavelength is the product of the conduction velocity and the effective refractory period. Pilsicainide suppresses atrial conduction velocity but also increases the effective refractory period(18). Its effects on the refractory period are significantly more substantial, and therefore pilsicainide treatment results in an increased wavelength and termination of atrial fibrillation. A single oral dose of pilsicainide effectively restores normal sinus rhythm in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and a healthy left ventricle. Long-term therapy with pilsicainide is successful in treating chronic atrial fibrillation).",

Sornette's group has contributed significantly to the theoretical development and study of the properties of the now standard Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. In a nutshell, this model states that each event triggers its own direct aftershocks, which themselves trigger their own aftershocks, and so on... The consequence is that events cannot be labeled anymore as foreshocks, mainshocks or aftershocks, as they can be all of that at the same time (with different levels of probability). In this model, the probability for an event to trigger another one primarily depends on their separating space and time distances, as well as on the magnitude of the triggering event, so that seismicity is then governed by a set of seven parameters. Sornette's group is currently pushing the model to its limits by allowing space and time variations of its parameters. Despite the fact that this new model reaches better forecasting scores than any other competing model, it is not sufficient to achieve systematic reliable predictions. The main reason is that this model predicts future seismicity rates quite accurately, but fails to put constraints on the magnitudes (which are assumed to be distributed according to the Gutenberg-Richter law, and to be independent of each other). Some other seismic or non-seismic precursors are thus required in order to further improve those forecasts. According to the ETAS model, the rate of triggered activity around a given event behaves isotropically. This over-simplified assumption has recently relaxed by coupling the statistics of ETAS to genuine mechanical information. This is done by modelling the stress perturbation due to a given event on its surroundings, and correlating it with the space-time rate of subsequent activity as a function of transferred stress amplitude and sign. This suggests that triggering of aftershocks stems from a combination of dynamic (seismic waves) and elasto-static processes. Another unambiguous interesting result of this work is that the Earth crust in Southern California has quite a short memory of past stress fluctuations lasting only about 3 to 4 months. This may put more constraint on the time window within which one may look for both seismic and non-seismic precursors.",

            "document": "History of network traffic models . Measurements are useful and necessary for verifying the actual network performance. However, measurements do not have the level of abstraction that makes traffic models useful. Traffic models can be used for hypothetical problem solving whereas traffic measurements only reflect current reality. In probabilistic terms, a traffic trace is a realization of a random process, whereas a traffic model is a random process. Thus, traffic models have universality. A traffic trace gives insight about a particular traffic source, but a traffic model gives insight about all traffic sources of that type. Traffic models have three major uses. One important use of traffic models is to properly dimension network resources for a target level of QoS. It was mentioned earlier that Erlang developed models of voice calls to estimate telephone switch capacity to achieve a target call blocking probability. Similarly, models of packet traffic are needed to estimate the bandwidth and buffer resources to provide acceptable packet delays and packet loss probability. Knowledge of the average traffic rate is not sufficient. It is known from queuing theory that queue lengths increase with the variability of traffic. Hence, an understanding of traffic burstiness or variability is needed to determine sufficient buffer sizes at nodes and link capacities. A second important use of traffic models is to verify network performance under specific traffic controls. For example, given a packet scheduling algorithm, it would be possible to evaluate the network performance resulting from different traffic scenarios. For another example, a popular area of research is new improvements to the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. It is critical that any algorithm is stable and allows multiple hosts to share bandwidth fairly, while sustaining a high throughput. Effective evaluation of the stability, fairness, and throughput of new algorithms would not be possible without realistic source models. A third important use of traffic models is admission control. In particular, connection oriented networks such as ATM depends on admission control to block new connections to maintain QOS guarantees. A simple admission strategy could be based on the peak rate of a new connection; a new connection is admitted if the available bandwidth is greater than the peak rate. However, that strategy would be overly conservative because a variable bit-rate connection may need significantly less bandwidth than its peak rate. A more sophisticated admission strategy is based on effective bandwidths. The source traffic behavior is translated into an effective bandwidth between the peak rate and average rate, which is the specific amount of bandwidth required to meet a given QoS constraint. The effective bandwidth depends on the variability of the source.",

Mathematical modeling can provide useful context for the rational design, validation and prioritization of novel cancer drug targets and their combinations. Network-based modeling and multi-scale modeling have begun to show promise in facilitating the process of effective cancer drug discovery. Using a systems network modeling approach, Schoerberl et al. identified a previously unknown, complementary and potentially superior mechanism of inhibiting the ErbB receptor signaling network. ErbB3 was found to be the most sensitive node, leading to Akt activation; Akt regulates many biological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis and growth, which are all relevant to tumor progression. This target driven modelling has paved way for first of its kind clinical trials. Bekkal et al. presented a nonlinear model of the dynamics of a cell population divided into proliferative and quiescent compartments. The proliferative phase represents the complete cell cycle (G (1)-S-G (2)-M) of a population committed to divide at its end. The asymptotic behavior of solutions of the nonlinear model is analysed in two cases, exhibiting tissue homeostasis or tumor exponential growth. The model is simulated and its analytic predictions are confirmed numerically.  Furthermore, advances in hardware and software have enabled the realization of clinically feasible, quantitative multimodality imaging of tissue pathophysiology. Earlier efforts relating to multimodality imaging of cancer have focused on the integration of anatomical and functional characteristics, such as PET-CT and single-photon emission CT (SPECT-CT), whereas more-recent advances and applications have involved the integration of multiple quantitative, functional measurements (for example, multiple PET tracers, varied MRI contrast mechanisms, and PET-MRI), thereby providing a more-comprehensive characterization of the tumour phenotype. The enormous amount of complementary quantitative data generated by such studies is beginning to offer unique insights into opportunities to optimize care for individual patients. Although important technical optimization and improved biological interpretation of multimodality imaging findings are needed, this approach can already be applied informatively in clinical trials of cancer therapeutics using existing tools.",

Cancer In this area the network uses computer models of the cell cycle and of its coupling to the 24 h day-and-night rhythm to improve the treatment of patients with cancer. The use of chronotherapy implies that the administration of anti-cancer drugs is adjusted in accordance with the circadian rhythm of the patient. For certain forms of cancer this has been found to increase the efficiency of the drug by a factor of five. Efforts are also devoted to the development of new anti-cancer drugs.

            "document": "Cellular model . The eukaryotic cell cycle is very complex and is one of the most studied topics, since its misregulation leads to cancers. It is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results. Two research groups have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model which can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006). By means of a system of ordinary differential equations these models show the change in time (dynamical system) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a deterministic process (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a stochastic process). To obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as rate kinetics for stoichiometric reactions, Michaelis-Menten kinetics for enzyme substrate reactions and Goldbeter\u2013Koshland kinetics for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size. In order to fit the parameters the differential equations need to be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis.  In a simulation, given a starting vector (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments. In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending of the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a vector field, where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a stable point, called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an unstable point, either a source or a saddle point which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate). A better representation which can handle the large number of variables and parameters is called a bifurcation diagram (bifurcation theory): the presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event (cell cycle checkpoint), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a Hopf bifurcation and an infinite period bifurcation. Cell Collective is a modeling software that enables one to house dynamical biological data, build computational models, stimulate, break and recreate models. The development is led by Tomas Helikar, a researcher within the field of computational biology. It is designed for biologists, students learning about computational biology, teachers focused on teaching life sciences, and researchers within the field of life science.

Nevertheless, three essential differences can be observed. The hypothesis of partitioning the strains by decoupling the elastic and plastic parts is still applicable where the strains are small, i.e., where formula_2 is the elastic strain and formula_3 is the viscoplastic strain. To obtain the stress\u2013strain behavior shown in blue in the figure, the material is initially loaded at a strain rate of 0.1/s. The strain rate is then instantaneously raised to 100/s and held constant at that value for some time. At the end of that time period the strain rate is dropped instantaneously back to 0.1/s and the cycle is continued for increasing values of strain.

Blocking from the extracellular side is weaker than from the intracellular side because it occurs via the hydrophobic pathway. Procainamide is present in charged form and probably requires a direct hydrophobic access to the binding site for blocking of the channel. Furthermore, blocking of the channel shows a decreased voltage sensitivity, which may result from the loss of voltage dependence of the blocking rate. Due to its charged and hydrophilic form, procainamide has its effect from the internal side, where it causes blockage of voltage-dependent, open channels. With increasing concentration of procainamide, the frequency of long blockage becomes less without the duration of blockage being affected. The rate of fast blocking is determined by the membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization leads to increased blocking and decreased unblocking of the channels.

Given that insular microcosms are common to all ecosystems, principles from island biogeography can be applied generally. In Chapters 2 and 3, MacArthur and Wilson postulate that insular species richness depends on island size and isolation from source regions. The authors present an equilibrium model that is based on the following concept: when there is an addition of the number of species on an island, the island's immigration rate of new species will decrease while the extinction rate of resident species will increase. MacArthur and Wilson thus assume that there will be an equilibrial point where the immigration rate equals the extinction rate. They further hypothesize that an increase in island size will lower extinction curves while a decrease in distance between the island and the source region will raise immigration curves. Since the intersection of immigration and extinction rate curves determines the species number, the authors predict that larger islands will have more species than smaller islands (assuming these islands are comparably isolated) and isolated islands will have fewer species than islands more proximal to source regions (assuming these islands are equally large). There is additional discourse on how insular clusters and stepping stones affect this model.",

The height of rise depends on the wall thickness, the sorptivity of the wall structure and the rate of evaporation. Further work has confirmed experimentally the importance of mortar properties in determining the height to which damp will rise in walls. \"BRE Digest\" 245 lists several factors that can influence the height of the rise including rate of evaporation from the wall, pore sizes of the masonry, salt content of the materials and the soil, groundwater and degree of saturation, and use of heating within the property. The effect of seasonal variations in evaporation rate on the height of moisture rise have been comprehensively described.
