Reverse vaccinology uses genomic sequences of viral, bacterial, or parasitic pathogens to identify genes potentially encoding genes that promote pathogenesis. The first application of reverse vaccinology identified vaccine candidates against \"Neisseria meningitidis\" serogroup B. Computational tools identified 600 putative surface-exposed or secreted proteins from the complete genome sequence of a MenB pathogenic strain, on the basis of sequence features. These putative proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and used to immunize mice. Tests using mice immune sera estimated the ability of antibodies to protect against these proteins. The proteins able to solicit a robust immune response were checked for sequence conservation across a panel of meningitides strains and allowed for further selection of antigen able to elicit an immune response against most strains in the panel. On the basis of these antigen sequences, scientists have been able to develop a universal \u201ccocktail\u201d vaccine against \"Neisseria meninitidis\" that uses five antigens to promote immunity. Similar approaches have been used for a variety of other human pathogens, such as \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\", \"Chlamydia pneumoniae\", \"Bacillus anthracis\", \"Porphyromonas gingivalis\", \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\", \"Helicobacter pylori\", amongst others.

New technologies are also being developed to grow viruses in cell culture, which promises higher yields, less cost, better quality and surge capacity.

The potential for immune memory may mean that the treatment effect is long-lasting (by contrast antibodies have a short half-life \u2013 that of Herceptin is only 12 days \u2013 meaning that the patient has to have infusions every 1\u20133 weeks). The vaccine would be available intra-muscularly, where Herceptin and Perjeta have to be given by regular infusions.",

            "document": "Intrastructural help . One of the approaches for a protective HIV-1 vaccine is broadly neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies are found in 10-25 % of HIV-1 infected patients. Few of those (worldwide 0.8% of HIV-1 positive individuals) are able to suppress viremia up to a level that is below the detection levels and are so-called \"elite controllers\" or \"long term non-progressors\". Most of the conducted vaccine trials were unable to induce protective neutralizing antibodies; even though some protective effects of poly-functional antibodies were observed. These Fc-dependent effects seem to play an important role in disease control as shown by the non-human primate (NHP) experiment. In contrast, the results of the adenoviral-based STEP trial suggested a higher susceptibility due to high levels of non-neutralizing poly-functional antibodies and helper T cell proliferation induced by vaccination. In mouse models antibodies from the IgG1 subclass, which were mostly induced by vaccination, were seen to possess a relatively low functionality. Therefore, one objective is to increase the quality of the immune response by the induction of poly-functional antibody sub classes, e.g. IgG2A. However, according to results from animal studies, cytotoxic T cells seem to be mandatory for a protective vaccine. Although this was not detectable in the human trials conducted to-date, it is assumed that reduction of viral loads early after infection can be achieved. Thus the current goal is to avoid uncontrolled T cell proliferation and modulate the humoral immune response towards highly efficient poly-functional monoclonal antibodies.",

            "document": "Cancer immunoprevention . Two main protective mechanisms elicited by cancer immunoprevention in various mouse models were cytokines released by T cells, in particular gamma-interferon, and cytotoxic antibodies against the target antigen. This is at variance with cancer immunotherapy administered to cure existing tumors, which is mainly based on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The lack of a relevant CTL response in long-term immunoprevention is thought to be an advantage, because chronic CTL activation is severely toxic for the host. In contrast circulating antibodies provide long-term protection without toxic side effects. A similar situation happens in viral immunity, acute infections are resolved by CTL, whereas long term immunity from reinfection is provided by antibodies. Both gamma-interferon and antibodies prevent tumor growth in multiple ways. Gamma-interferon activates T, natural killer and B cells, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor invasiveness, stimulates major histocompatibility complex expression in tumor cells and inhibits cell proliferation. Antibodies binding to antigens on the surface of cells trigger lytic mechanisms mediated by the complement system (complement-mediated cytotoxicity) or by leukocytes carrying Fc receptors (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). Moreover, antibody binding interferes with the cellular functions of the target antigen, causing its internalization or hampering molecular interactions, eventually blocking downstream signaling. If the target antigen controls cell growth (e.g. if it is the product of an oncogene), then a block of signaling can disrupt the carcinogenic process. Surface antigens causally involved in carcinogenesis are called oncoantigens.",

While vaccines are created to strengthen the immune response to pathogens, in many cases these vaccines are not able to cover the wide variety of strains a pathogen may have. Instead they may only protect against one or two strains, leading to the escape of strains not covered by the vaccine. This results in the pathogens being able to attack targets of the immune system different than those intended to be targeted by the vaccination. This parasitic antigen diversity is particularly troublesome for the development of the malaria vaccines.",

Human monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design: Taking advantage of his studies on human memory B cells (16), Lanazvecchia developed novel and robust methods to immortalize human memory B cells and to preserve single plasma cells in culture (17, 18). He used these methods to interrogate the memory repertoire of selected individuals to isolate monoclonal antibodies with unique specificities. Several examples illustrate the power and utility of this approach. Neutralizing antibodies were isolated against SARS, cytomegalovirus, avian influenza and dengue virus. Unusually potent antibodies that neutralize human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were isolated and their epitopes mapped to a pentameric glycoprotein complex, which is currently tested as a candidate vaccine. The most striking examples are antibodies with exceptional breadth, being able to neutralize all influenza A viruses and even four different paramyxoviruses (18,19). The methods to isolate human monoclonal antibodies developed by Lanzavecchia have realized a long-sought goal: the full exploitation of the human immune response for serotherapy and vaccine design. These fully human monoclonal antibodies can be used not only as drugs for prophylaxis and therapy of infectious diseases, but also as tools to identify vaccine candidates, a process defined as \u201canalytic vaccinology\u201d (20). The present work in Lanzavecchia\u2019s laboratory addresses fundamental issues on the role of somatic mutations and the pathways leading to the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies and explores the relationship between infection and autoimmunity (21).",

One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins can be denatured and will then become associated with antibodies different from the desired antibodies. A second method of making a subunit vaccine involves putting an antigen's gene from the targeted virus or bacterium into another virus (virus vector), yeast (yeast vector) in the case of the hepatitis B vaccine or attenuated bacterium (bacterial vector) to make a recombinant virus or bacteria to serve as the important component of a recombinant vaccine (called a recombinant subunit vaccine). The recombinant vector that is genomically modified will express the antigen. The antigen (one or more subunits of protein) is extracted from the vector. Just like the highly successful subunit vaccines, the recombinant-vector-produced antigen will be of little to no risk to the patient. This is the type of vaccine currently in use for hepatitis B, and it is experimentally popular, being used to try to develop new vaccines for difficult-to-vaccinate-against viruses such as ebolavirus and HIV.",

This technique uses the specificity of antibodies to their antigen to target fluorescent dyes to specific biomolecule targets within a cell, and therefore allows visualization of the distribution of the target molecule through the sample. The specific region an antibody recognizes on an antigen is called an epitope. There have been efforts in epitope mapping since many antibodies can bind the same epitope and levels of binding between antibodies that recognize the same epitope can vary. Additionally, the binding of the fluorophore to the antibody itself cannot interfere with the immunological specificity of the antibody or the binding capacity of its antigen. Immunofluorescence is a widely used example of immunostaining (using antibodies to stain proteins) and is a specific example of immunohistochemistry (the use of the antibody-antigen relationship in tissues).
