Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that occurs in children and is usually characterized by a recurrent t(2;13)(q35;q14) chromosomal translocation. This 2;13 translocation breaks and rejoins portions of the PAX3 and FOXO1 genes to generate a PAX3-FOXO1 fusion gene that expresses a PAX3-FOXO1 fusion transcript encoding a PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein. PAX3 and FOXO1 encode transcription factors, and the translocation results in a fusion transcription factor containing the N-terminal PAX3 DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal FOXO1 transactivation domain. A smaller subset of ARMS cases is associated with less common fusions of PAX7 to FOXO1 or rare fusions of PAX3 to other transcription factors, such as NCOA1. Compared to the wild-type PAX3 protein, the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein more potently activates PAX3 target genes. In ARMS cells, PAX3-FOXO1 usually functions as a transcriptional activator and excessively increases expression of downstream target genes. In addition, PAX3-FOXO1 binds along with MYOD1, MYOG and MYCN as well as chromatin structural proteins, such as CHD4 and BRD4, to contribute to the formation of super enhancers in the vicinity of a subset of these target genes. These dysregulated target genes contribute to tumorigenesis by altering signaling pathways that affect proliferation, cell death, myogenic differentiation, and migration.",

The fusion protein AML1-ETO is commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia patients. p14 is a well known tumor suppressor that serves as the safety net when p53 tumor suppressor\u2019s functions are inhibited. Many cancers recognize the potential of the p14 tumor suppressor to block cell growth so it is commonly mutated or inhibited in cancer cells. The AML1-ETO is incapable of p14 transcription as the fusion protein took on AML1\u2019s involvement with ARF gene expression and ETO\u2019s transcription repression. The Akt/PKB signaling is a pathway that is pro-survival and growth. By activating Mdm2, the signal transduction pathway will trigger the anti-apoptotic downstream effects of Mdm2. With no p14 to regulate and inhibit Mdm2, there will be an increased level of suppression of p53. Mdm2 is a proto-oncogene that directly antagonizes p53 to ubiquitination (Figure 1). The p53 protein is known as the \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d due to its ability to induce DNA repair enzymes and regulate cell cycle advancements. The down regulation of p53 by Mdm2 would lead to unchecked proliferative growth. The direct consequence of having the fusion protein, AML1-ETO, is the lack of p53 regulation in pre-leukemic cells. Therefore, there are an increased number of immature cells that are unable to carry out normal function, which is essentially cancer (Faderi et al., 2000, Song et al. 2005, Weinberg, 2014).",

            "document": "Transcriptional regulation . Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences in order to regulate the expression of a given gene. The power of transcription factors resides in their ability to activate and/or repress wide repertoires of downstream target genes. The fact that these transcription factors work in a combinatorial fashion means that only a small subset of an organism's genome encodes transcription factors. Transcription factors function through a wide variety of mechanisms. Often they are at the end of a signal transduction pathway that functions to change something about the factor, like its subcellular localization or its activity. Post-translational modifications to transcription factors located in the cytosol can cause them to translocate to the nucleus where they can interact with their corresponding enhancers. Others are already in the nucleus, and are modified to enable the interaction with partner transcription factors. Some post-translational modifications known to regulate the functional state of transcription factors are phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitylation. Transcription factors can be divided in two main categories: activators and repressors. While activators can interact directly or indirectly with the core machinery of transcription through enhancer binding, repressors predominantly recruit co-repressor complexes leading to transcriptional repression by chromatin condensation of enhancer regions. It may also happen that a repressor may function by allosteric competition against a determined activator to repress gene expression: overlapping DNA-binding motifs for both activators and repressors induce a physical competition to occupy the site of binding. If the repressor has a higher affinity for its motif than the activator, transcription would be effectively blocked in the presence of the repressor. Tight regulatory control is achieved by the highly dynamic nature of transcription factors. Again, many different mechanisms exist to control whether a transcription factor is active. These mechanisms include control over protein localization or control over whether the protein can bind DNA. An example of this is the protein HSF1, which remains bound to Hsp70 in the cytosol and is only translocated into the nucleus upon cellular stress such as heat shock. Thus the genes under the control of this transcription factor will remain untranscribed unless the cell is subjected to stress.",

It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a methylase domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in methylation state of DNA in that region will subsequently result. Transcription rates of genes so-affected will be reduced. Many of the effector domains function to modulate either the DNA directly - e.g. via methylation, cleaving, or recombination of the target DNA sequence - or by modulating its transcription rate - e.g. inhibiting transcription via repressor domains that block transcriptional machinery, promoting transcription with activation domains that recruit transcriptional machinery to the site, or histone- or other epigenetic-modification domains that affect chromatin state and the ability of transcriptional machinery to access the affected genes. Epigenetic modification is a major theme in determining varying expression levels for genes, as explained by the idea that how tightly-wound the DNA strand is - from histones at the local level up to chromatin at the chromosomal level - can influence the accessibility of sequences of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing the rate at which it can be transcribed. If, instead of impacting the DNA strand directly, as described above, a designer zinc-finger protein instead affects epigenetic modification state for a target DNA region, modulation of gene expression could similarly be accomplished. In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression in vivo, Choo \"et al\" designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. This specific oncogene is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The oncogene typically enables leukemia cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of cancer. By including a nuclear localization signal with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo \"et al\" were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo. Leukemia cells became dependent on regular growth factors, bringing the cell cycle back under the control of normal regulation.",

Mutating conserved cysteine residues in the DEAF-1 MYND domain does not abolish DNA binding, which suggests that the MYND domain might be involved in protein-protein interactions. Indeed, the MYND domain of ETO/MTG8 interacts directly with the N-CoR and SMRT co-repressors. Aberrant recruitment of co-repressor complexes and inappropriate transcriptional repression is believed to be a general mechanism of leukemogenesis caused by the t(8;21) translocations that fuse ETO with the acute myelogenous leukemia 1 (AML1) protein.

ID proteins also contain the HLH-dimerization domain but lack the basic DNA-binding domain and thus regulate bHLH transcription factors when they heterodimerize with bHLH proteins. The first helix-loop-helix proteins identified were named E-proteins because they bind to Ephrussi-box (E-box) sequences. In normal development, E proteins form dimers with other bHLH transcription factors, allowing transcription to occur. However, in cancerous phenotypes, ID proteins can regulate transcription by binding E proteins, so no dimers can be formed and transcription is inactive. E proteins are members of the class I bHLH family and form dimers with bHLH proteins from class II to regulate transctiption. Four ID proteins exist in humans: ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4. The ID homologue gene in Drosophila is called extramacrochaetae (EMC) and encodes a transcription factor of the helix-loop-helix family that lacks a DNA binding domain. EMC regulates cell proliferation, formation of organs like the midgut, and wing development. ID proteins could be potential targets for systemic cancer therapies without inhibiting the functioning of most normal cells because they are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated adult cells.

The use of microfluidics in SMiLE-seq offers three main advantages when compared to current techniques used to measure protein-DNA interactions (e.g., ChIP-seq, HT-SELEX, and protein binding microarrays). Firstly, it requires fewer transcription factors than other similar techniques (only picograms are required). Secondly, the process is much faster than other techniques (it requires less than an hour, as compared to days). Lastly, SMiLE-seq is not limited by the length of target DNA (a limitation of protein binding microarrays), and is not biased towards stronger affinity protein-DNA interactions (a major limitation of HT-SELEX). Existing technologies have been found to be laborious and technically complex due to improper transcription factor expression or loss of transcription factor-DNA binding properties \"in vitro\". The ability of many transcription factors to bind DNA is dependent on heterodimer formation, and therefore requires the presence of a specific dimer partner for binding. This has been shown to yield incomplete results if transcription factors are individually tested. Heterodimer combinations have been shown to range from 3000 to 25000, and many remain uncharacterized. A technology like SMiLE-seq, which is able to detect these dimeric interactions, is essential to broaden current knowledge and characterization of transcription factor-DNA binding profiles. Additionally, previous technologies have used transcription factor probes in their truncated form, which may reduce their ability to bind and dimerize. SMiLE-seq enables robust identification of DNA binding specificities of full length, previously uncharacterized transcription factors. Furthermore, SMiLE-seq is able to identify transcription factor binding sites over a wide range of binding affinities, which represents a significant limitation of other technologies. In theory SMiLE-seq is not limited to only protein-DNA interactions and may potentially be utilized to study protein-RNA binding properties once the technology has been developed further.",

Among the few corresponding protein products that have been characterized so far, most result from chromosomal translocations and are associated with cancer. For instance, gene fusion in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) leads to an mRNA transcript that encompasses the 5\u2032 end of the breakpoint cluster region protein (BCR) gene and the 3\u2032 end of the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL) gene.

Chimeric transcripts characterize specific cellular phenotypes and are suspected to function not only in cancer, but also in normal cells.

It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a methylase domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in methylation state of DNA in that region will subsequently result. Transcription rates of genes so-affected will be reduced. Many of the effector domains function to modulate either the DNA directly - e.g. via methylation, cleaving, or recombination of the target DNA sequence - or by modulating its transcription rate - e.g. inhibiting transcription via repressor domains that block transcriptional machinery, promoting transcription with activation domains that recruit transcriptional machinery to the site, or histone- or other epigenetic-modification domains that affect chromatin state and the ability of transcriptional machinery to access the affected genes. Epigenetic modification is a major theme in determining varying expression levels for genes, as explained by the idea that how tightly-wound the DNA strand is - from histones at the local level up to chromatin at the chromosomal level - can influence the accessibility of sequences of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing the rate at which it can be transcribed. If, instead of impacting the DNA strand directly, as described above, a designer zinc-finger protein instead affects epigenetic modification state for a target DNA region, modulation of gene expression could similarly be accomplished. In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression in vivo, Choo \"et al\" designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. This specific oncogene is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The oncogene typically enables leukemia cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of cancer. By including a nuclear localization signal with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo \"et al\" were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo.

Characterizing the binding mechanisms and specificities of transcription factors to specific regions of DNA \u2013 and identifying these transcription factors \u2013 is a fundamental component of the process of resolving cellular regulatory dynamics. Before the introduction of SMiLE-seq technology, ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) and HT-SELEX (high throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technologies were used to successfully characterize nearly 500 transcription factor-DNA binding interactions. ChIP-seq uses immunoprecipitation to isolate specific transcription factors bound to DNA fragments.

HT-SELEX, a similar method, uses random, synthetically generated DNA molecules as bait for transcription factors \"in vitro\".

The power of transcription factors resides in their ability to activate and/or repress wide repertoires of downstream target genes. The fact that these transcription factors work in a combinatorial fashion means that only a small subset of an organism's genome encodes transcription factors. Transcription factors function through a wide variety of mechanisms. Often they are at the end of a signal transduction pathway that functions to change something about the factor, like its subcellular localization or its activity. Post-translational modifications to transcription factors located in the cytosol can cause them to translocate to the nucleus where they can interact with their corresponding enhancers. Others are already in the nucleus, and are modified to enable the interaction with partner transcription factors. Some post-translational modifications known to regulate the functional state of transcription factors are phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitylation. Transcription factors can be divided in two main categories: activators and repressors. While activators can interact directly or indirectly with the core machinery of transcription through enhancer binding, repressors predominantly recruit co-repressor complexes leading to transcriptional repression by chromatin condensation of enhancer regions. It may also happen that a repressor may function by allosteric competition against a determined activator to repress gene expression: overlapping DNA-binding motifs for both activators and repressors induce a physical competition to occupy the site of binding. If the repressor has a higher affinity for its motif than the activator, transcription would be effectively blocked in the presence of the repressor. Tight regulatory control is achieved by the highly dynamic nature of transcription factors. Again, many different mechanisms exist to control whether a transcription factor is active. These mechanisms include control over protein localization or control over whether the protein can bind DNA. An example of this is the protein HSF1, which remains bound to Hsp70 in the cytosol and is only translocated into the nucleus upon cellular stress such as heat shock. Thus the genes under the control of this transcription factor will remain untranscribed unless the cell is subjected to stress.",

The configuration of the genome is essential for enhancer-promoter proximity. Cell-fate decisions are mediated upon highly dynamic genomic reorganizations at interphase to modularly switch on or off entire gene regulatory networks through short to long range chromatin rearrangements. Related studies demonstrate that metazoan genomes are partitioned in structural and functional units around a megabase long called Topological association domains (TADs) containing dozens of genes regulated by hundreds of enhancers distributed within large genomic regions containing only non-coding sequences. The function of TADs is to regroup enhancers and promoters interacting together within a single large functional domain instead of having them spread in different TADs. However, studies of mouse development point out that two adjacent TADs may regulate the same gene cluster. The most relevant study on limb evolution shows that the TAD at the 5\u2019 of the HoxD gene cluster in tetrapod genomes drives its expression in the distal limb bud embryos, giving rise to the hand, while the one located at 3\u2019 side does it in the proximal limb bud, giving rise to the arm. Still, it is not known whether TADs are an adaptive strategy to enhance regulatory interactions or an effect of the constrains on these same interactions. TAD boundaries are often composed by housekeeping genes, tRNAs, other highly expressed sequences and Short Interspersed Elements (SINE). While these genes may take advantage of their border position to be ubiquitously expressed, they are not directly linked with TAD edge formation. The specific molecules identified at boundaries of TADs are called insulators or architectural proteins because they not only block enhancer leaky expression but also ensure an accurate compartmentalization of cis-regulatory inputs to the targeted promoter. These insulators are DNA-binding proteins like CTCF and TFIIIC that help recruiting structural partners such as cohesins and condensins. The localization and binding of architectural proteins to their corresponding binding sites is regulated by post-translational modifications. DNA binding motifs recognized by architectural proteins are either of high occupancy and at around a megabase of each other or of low occupancy and inside TADs. High occupancy sites are usually conserved and static while intra-TADs sites are dynamic according to the state of the cell therefore TADs themselves are compartmentalized in subdomains that can be called subTADs from few kb up to a TAD long (19). When architectural binding sites are at less than 100 kb from each other, Mediator proteins are the architectural proteins cooperate with cohesin. For subTADs larger than 100 kb and TAD boundaries, CTCF is the typical insulator found to interact with cohesion.",

In recent studies, scientists recognize the significance of autophagy both as a potential anti-apoptotic response to cancer treatments as well as a potential mechanism for getting rid of undesirable fusion proteins such as AML1-ETO. In a 2013 study, scientists demonstrated that the degradation of fusion oncoprotein AML1-ETO is not mediated by autophagy through a set of drug dosage trials testing the levels of AML1-ETO protein expression. The acute myeloid leukemia Kasumi-1 cell line was selected for the experiment due to its AML1-ETO positive characteristics. These cells were treated with increasing concentrations of each histone deacetylase inhibitors \u2013 valproic acid (VPA) (epileptic and bipolar drug) or vorinostat (cutaneous T cell lymphoma drug), which are known to induce autophagy associated with loss of the fusion protein. The two inhibitors were added to the cell line in doses of 0, 0.38 uM, 0.74 uM, and 1.5 uM. The cell lysates were then treated with autophagy inhibitors Baf or CQ, or control. Through immunoblotting, there is no reduction of AML1-ETO observed across the different concentrations of VPA or vorinostat. The results indicate that AML1-ETO degradation is not mediated by autophagy, but there is an observed pro-survival autophagy in the leukemic cells (Torgersen et al., 2013). Thus, an inhibition of autophagy would be a viable treatment method for subtype M2 acute myeloid leukemia.",

A defect in either of these regulators results in a pattern which is initially correct but is not maintained at later embryonic stages. The Polycomb and Trithorax regulators act in opposite ways.

Among the few corresponding protein products that have been characterized so far, most result from chromosomal translocations and are associated with cancer.
