The many types of pheromones (i.e. alarm, aggregation, defense, sexual attraction) all have a common cause acting as chemical cues to trigger a response. However, sex pheromones are particularly associated with signaling mating behaviors or dominance. The odors released can be seen as a favorable trait selected by either the male or female leading to attraction and copulation. Chemical signaling is also used to find genetically different mates and thus avoid inbreeding. Females are often selective when deciding to mate, and chemical communication ensures that they find a high-quality mate that satisfies their reproductive needs.",

FA acts as an index for measuring developmental instability as it provides a clear indicator of the possible environmental and genetic stressors affecting development. It is thought that having a preference for a symmetrical face offers some adaptive value as such symmetry may signal an individual's ability to cope with environmental challenges. FA shares an inverse relationship with certain desired traits; a low FA is correlated with higher stress tolerance, larger body size in males, smaller body size in females, and higher facial attractiveness.

Ornaments are most often observed in males and choosing an extravagantly ornamented male benefits females because the genes that produce the ornament will be passed on to her offspring, increasing their own reproductive fitness. As Ronald Fisher noted, the male offspring will inherit the ornament while the female offspring will inherit the preference for said ornament, which can lead to a positive feedback loop known as a Fisherian runaway.

Pheromone signaling is used within fungi to either attract a mate or to assess the quality of that gamete; and tends to be more effective when occurring over small distances. Female gametes are typically the ones responsibly for producing pheromones in order to attract a mate. However, pheromones can also be released by conidia. Male choice can occur in populations where there is a low concentration of male gametes, allowing them to be selective in which female to fertilize. The female with the highest concentration of pheromone is usually chosen. In situations where fertilization may have to occur over long distances, water-soluble pheromones may be secreted as seen in the female gametes of an aquatic Chytridiomycetes. The same similarly occurs within an aquatic oomycete algae species; also, a variation in the pheromone production related to the male reaction has been observed. Variations within the pheromone production as well as the response have been studied and found be affected by environmental conditions as well as developmental differences between the fungi. Although not proven, the production of pheromones may lead to Fisherian runaway selection in which the production of pheromone increases due to the increase in its preference throughout generations., In addition to pheromone signaling being used as a method in finding a mate, it also appears to be utilized as a method to assess mate quality. Pheromones are costly to produce due to post-translational modification and therefore may be subject to the handicap principle in which an organisms cannot fake its fitness by producing pheromones. In the isogamous budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pheromones are used to distinguish between different mating types and show a preference for higher concentrations of pheromones along with a rejection of lower concentrations. However, all of the pheromone studies within fungi have been performed in a laboratory.

Females choose the males with which they will mate, so this sexual selection becomes a major pressure and driving force behind natural selection.

It is needed to fully activate AKT and consists of two discrete protein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, only one of which, TORC1, binds rapamycin. In addition to mTOR, the TORC2 complex contains RICTOR, mLST8, and SIN1 and regulates insulin action and Akt phosphorylation. Thus, mTOR sits at a critical juncture between insulin and nutrient signaling, making it important both for insulin signaling downstream from Akt and for nutrient sensing. Until now, it has not been known whether nesfatin-1 affects activation of mTOR. To gain further insight into the mechanism underlying the insulin-sensitizing effects of ICV nesfatin-1, we assessed mTOR and TORC2 phosphorylation in liver samples of SD- and HFD-fed animals. Both mTOR and TORC2 phosphorylations were increased in livers from these rats, demonstrating activation of mTOR and TORC2 by central nesfatin-1 in vivo. As mTOR kinase activity is required for Akt phosphorylation, the observed increased Akt phosphorylation may have been caused by the concomitant activation of the mTOR/TORC2. Thus, it's postulated that the mTOR/TORC2 plays a role as a negative-feedback mechanism in the regulation of metabolism and insulin sensitivity mediated by central nesfatin-1.",

Research has shown attractiveness ratings of men's scent are negatively correlated with FA, but FA is unrelated to attractiveness ratings for women's scent, and women's preferences for the scent of more symmetric men appears to limited to the most fertile phases of the menstrual cycle However, other research has failed to find changes in women's preferences for low FA across the menstrual cycle. Facial symmetry has been positively correlated with higher occurrences of mating. Also, one study used 3-D scans of male and female bodies, and showed videos of these scans to a group of individuals who rated the bodies on attractiveness. It was found that, for both males and females, lower levels of FA were associated with higher attractiveness ratings. It was also found that sex-typical joint configurations were rated as more attractive and linked to lower FA in men, but not women. Men with higher FA have been shown to have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of attractiveness. Research has also provided evidence that FA is linked to extra-pair copulation, as women have been shown to prefer men with lower levels of FA as extra-pair partners. However, the literature is mixed regarding the relationship between attractiveness and FA. For example, in one study, altering images of faces to in a way that reduced asymmetry led to observers rating such faces as less, rather than more, attractive. Research by Van Dongen also found FA to be unrelated to attractiveness, physical strength and level of masculinity in both men and women. Many non-human animals have been shown to be able to distinguish between potential partners, based upon levels of FA. As with humans, lower levels of FA are seen in the most reproductively successful members of species. For instance, FA of male forewing length seem to have an important role in successful mating for many insect species, such as dark-wing damselflies and Japanese scorpionflies. In the dark-winged damselfly (\"Calopteryx maculate\"), successfully mating male flies showed significantly lower levels of FA in their forewings than unsuccessful males, while for Japanese scorpionflies, FA levels are a good predictor for the outcome of fights between males in that more symmetrical males won significantly more fights. Other animals also show similar patterns, for example, many species of butterfly, males with lower levels of FA tended to live longer and flew more actively, allowing them to have more reproductive success. Also, female swallows have been shown to prefer longer, and more symmetrical tails as a cue for mate choice. Therefore, the males with longer and more symmetrical tails show higher levels of reproductive success with more attractive females.

Pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN) is a peptide that regulates pheromone production in moths. It acts on the pheromone gland cells using calcium and cyclic AMP. Although the photoperiod regulates the release of PBAN to some extent, the chemical signals from the host plant supersede the effect from the time of day. Female \"Helicoverpa zea\" in corn fields do not produce pheromones during the night until they encounter corn. Several natural corn silk volatiles like the plant hormone ethylene induce \"H. zea\" pheromone production. The presence of the silk from an ear of corn is enough to cause pheromone production, and physical contact between females and corn is unnecessary. This evolutionary mechanism enables the moths to coordinate their reproductive behavior with the availability of food. Female moths often become depleted of sex pheromone after mating within 2 hours of separation from the male. The pheromonostatic peptide (PSP), a protein 57 amino acids long found in the male accessory gland, is what causes depletion of the female\u2019s sex pheromone. This capability in males has been selected for because it increases the reproductive fitness of those that carry it, since other males will not be attracted to a female without a sex pheromone; thus, the female will bear only the first male's offspring. The transfer of a spermatophore without accessory gland products does not stop female pheromone production, but does stop the female's calling behavior. Intense selection acting on males to manipulate female reproductive physiology promotes rapid evolution of specific molecules, and male-derived pheromone suppressing factors exhibit positive selection.",

For example, it has been suggested that human language has been selected during evolution as a type of \"mating signal\" that allows potential mates to judge reproductive fitness. Miller described evolutionary psychology as a starting place for further research: \"Cognitive neuroscience could try to localize courtship adaptations in the brain. Most importantly, we need much better observations concerning real-life human courtship, including the measurable aspects of courtship that influence mate choice, the reproductive (or at least sexual) consequences of individual variation in those aspects, and the social-cognitive and emotional mechanisms of falling in love.\" Since Darwin's time there have been similar speculations about the evolution of human interest in music also as a potential signaling system for attracting and judging the fitness of potential mates. It has been suggested that the human capacity to experience love has been evolved as a signal to potential mates that the partner will be a good parent and be likely to help pass genes to future generations. Biologist Jeremy Griffith defines love as 'unconditional selflessness', suggesting utterly cooperative instincts developed in modern humans' ancestor, \"Australopithecus\".

This is related to Fisher\u2019s \u201csexy son\u201d hypothesis, which suggests a causal link between male attractiveness and the quality of sons based on the inheritance of \u201cgood genes\u201d that should improve the reproductive success of sons. Fawcett (2007) predicted that it is adaptive for females to adjust their sex ratio to favor sons in response to attractive males. Based on a computer model, he proposed that if sexual selection favors costly male traits, i.e. ornamentation, and costly female preferences, females should produce more male offspring when they mate with an attractive male compared to an unattractive male. Fawcett proposed that there is a direct correlation between female bias for male offspring and attractiveness of their mate. Computer simulations have costs and constraints, and selection may be weaker in natural populations than it was in Fawcett's study. While his results provide support for the Trivers-Willard hypothesis that animals adaptively adjust the sex ratio of offspring due to environmental variables, further empirical studies are needed to see if sex ratio is adjusted in response to mate attractiveness.",

Buss stated the specific age preference of around 25 years implied that fertility was a stronger ultimate cause of mate preference than reproductive value as data suggested that fertility peaks in females around mid-twenties. From a life history theory perspective, females that have these cues, display they are more capable of reproductive investment. This notion of preference of age due to peak fertility is supported by Kenrick, Keefe, Gabrielidis, and Cornelius's study, which found that although teenage males would accept a mate slightly younger than themselves, there was a wider range of preference for ages above their own. Teenage males also report that their ideal mates would be several years older than themselves.",

            "document": "Sexual selection in birds . Cosmetic coloration is another mechanism by which male birds use to try to attract a mate. Cosmetic coloration involves brightening of a birds feathers, thus making it more attractive to females. Cosmetic coloration has two different types. The first is a type is when substances are produced by the bird itself such as uropygial gland secretions, skin secretions, and powder. The second kind are substances that the bird acquires from the environment such as soil or vegetal matter contained in carcass viscera and fresh vegetation. The first type of coloration, whereby the animal produces the substances for coloration, is directed by secretions of the uropygial gland. This gland secretes waxes and oils that make feathers appear glossier which causes an increase in brightness. The feathers coated with the preen oils look brighter and the degree to which the plumage was glossy was a way in which mates could determine the diet or overall health of the individual. The uropygial gland also can change the shape of the reflected light off the feathers, which alters what wavelengths of light are reflected. The secretions of the gland illustrate how this coloration is cosmetic. For example, species of hornbill produce colored gland secretions that they apply to their plumage, thereby changing the color of their feathers. Only sexually mature birds develop the coloration, which would lead to the inference that these secretions have something to do with the sexual activity of the birds. Another example is in the greater flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus. This study found that the flamingo applied these carotenoid rich secretions from the uropygial gland on its plumage and the resulting cosmetic coloration may influence mate choice. This data is supported by the findings that application of the oils was more frequent during periods where the flamingos were displaying for mates and the presence of the cosmetic coloration decreased after egg hatching, indicating that the coloration has the function of finding mates but it is not of use after a mate has been found. A last example is in the house finch where they found that preen waxes on feathers acted as cosmetics and that the waxes increased the signal content of feather traits. The signal content correlated to the condition of the individual and increased the signaling value to mates, and therefore affected mate choice, implying that cosmetic coloration has some effect on sexual selection. These carotenoid pigments have been seen in multiple families of birds and have been traced back Cenozoic era, indicating that these pigments have a strong evolutionary benefit to the individual. The second type of coloration that also involves gland secretions is with powder feathers. Powder feathers are modified feathers that disintegrate into a fine powder. These powder feathers are found on pigeons, parrots, and herons. Herons provide a great example of how cosmetic coloration is related to mate choice and sexual selection. In the whistling heron, they develop a yellowish color on their neck, stomach, and tail due to the powder feathers. The coloration due to the powder is more intense during breeding season. In bustards, males use a red powder during courtship displays to attract mates and then the powder fades after the display. These examples show how these modifications to feathers can affect mate choice. The last kind of cosmetic coloration is when external substances are used to color the feathers, such as dirt. In bearded vultures, individuals will bath in mud and the degree to which the mud stains the feathers is seen as a sign of dominance. This sign of dominance could then affect mate choice.",

This may occur because the attractive males are better equipped to escape from bats, thus decreasing the apparently high risk. Another theory is that risk taking could be a sexually selected trait. Females can decipher between the moth calling and the bat calling sound. During mate calling, females fan their wings. However, when they hear the bat\u2019s sound, they stop fanning their wings.

Some sexually selected traits help males find females faster, and these individuals are at an advantage in contrast to those males lacking these traits. Evolution has allowed traits to be selected during sexual selection. These traits provide males an advantage to find females faster in contrast to those males lacking these traits. Sexual selection allows males to receive receptivity signals from females, in the form of pheromones which are detected by the males. Mature females release a pheromone to reduce their attractiveness towards males due to the high costs of re-mating for the egg sac (infanticide mentioned above). Mature females are aggressive towards males due to infanticide caused by males, which is costly to the females. However, a high chance of multiple mates can increase the likelihood of genetic compatibility in embryo formation. It is important to note that although multiple mates can increase the likelihood of genetic compatibility, it cannot be considered a major fitness advantage. Research and experimenting has been able to show that the increased viability of embryos\u2014due to increased genetic compatibility\u2014did not significantly increase the number of individuals in the population over time, and therefore, did not play a significant role in the fitness of the overall population.

As Ronald Fisher noted, the male offspring will inherit the ornament while the female offspring will inherit the preference for said ornament, which can lead to a positive feedback loop known as a Fisherian runaway.

Male choice can occur in populations where there is a low concentration of male gametes, allowing them to be selective in which female to fertilize. The female with the highest concentration of pheromone is usually chosen. In situations where fertilization may have to occur over long distances, water-soluble pheromones may be secreted as seen in the female gametes of an aquatic Chytridiomycetes. The same similarly occurs within an aquatic oomycete algae species; also, a variation in the pheromone production related to the male reaction has been observed. Variations within the pheromone production as well as the response have been studied and found be affected by environmental conditions as well as developmental differences between the fungi. Although not proven, the production of pheromones may lead to Fisherian runaway selection in which the production of pheromone increases due to the increase in its preference throughout generations., In addition to pheromone signaling being used as a method in finding a mate, it also appears to be utilized as a method to assess mate quality. Pheromones are costly to produce due to post-translational modification and therefore may be subject to the handicap principle in which an organisms cannot fake its fitness by producing pheromones.

Since sexual selection by females for specific male trait values should erode genetic diversity, the maintenance of genetic variation in lekking species constitutes a paradox in evolutionary biology. Many attempts have been made to explain it away, but the paradox remains. There are two conditions in which the lek paradox arises. The first is that males contribute only genes and the second is that female preference does not affect fecundity. Female choice should lead to directional runaway selection, resulting in a greater prevalence for the selected traits. Stronger selection should lead to impaired survival, as it decreases genetic variance and ensures that more offspring have similar traits. However, lekking species do not exhibit runaway selection. In a lekking reproductive system, what male sexual characteristics can signal to females is limited, as the males provide no resources to females or parental care to their offspring. This implies that females gain indirect benefits from her choice in the form of \"good genes\" for her offspring. Amotz Zahavi argued that male sexual characteristics only convey useful information to the females if these traits confer a handicap on the male. The handicap principle may be a resolution to the lek paradox, for if females select for the condition of male ornaments, then their offspring have better fitness. One potential resolution to the lek paradox is Rowe and Houle's theory that sexually selected traits depend on physical condition, which might in turn, summarize many genetic loci. This is the genic capture hypothesis, which describes how a significant amount of the genome is involved in shaping the traits that are sexually selected. There are two assumptions in the genic capture hypothesis: the first is that sexually selected traits are dependent upon condition and the second is that general condition is attributable to high genetic variance. In addition, W. D. Hamilton and M. Zuk proposed that sexually selected traits might signal resistance to parasites. One resolution to the lek paradox involves female preferences and how preference alone does not cause a drastic enough directional selection to diminish the genetic variance in fitness. Another conclusion is that the preferred trait is not naturally selected for or against and the trait is maintained because it implies increased attractiveness to the male.",

The order in which various males mate with one female before fertilization also affects fertilization success. The last male that mates with a female tends to have the highest fertilization success. Traits that increase the ability of a male\u2019s sperm to successfully fertilize a female\u2019s egg compared to that of another male are most advantageous. This is because these traits have been selected for over traits that have lower fertilization success.",

Although pheromones alone do not cause a female to move towards a male for mating, odor, signal location, and male-male interactions may play a role in male attractiveness. Females mainly select males based on the characteristics of their call. Females prefer males with a fast pulse pair rate, high peak song amplitude, and large wing beat asynchrony. This preference may be evolutionary, with signal quality being an indicator of a male\u2019s gene quality. Because female choice occurs between aggregated males at leks, they assess a male\u2019s call in relation to his neighbors. In other words, at leks, the relative threshold sounds are determinate of male attractiveness rather than absolute threshold. If an individual is in a group of males with high quality sounds, their individual relative attractiveness decreases. There also seems to be some variation in female preference. Because some signal characteristics are heritable, female preference could lead to evolutionary changes in mate calling.",

Similar to the idea behind the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, studies show that mate attractiveness and quality may also explain differences in sex ratios and offspring fitness. Weatherhead and Robertson (1979) predicted that females bias the sex ratio of their offspring in favor of sons if they are mated to more attractive and better quality males. This is related to Fisher\u2019s \u201csexy son\u201d hypothesis, which suggests a causal link between male attractiveness and the quality of sons based on the inheritance of \u201cgood genes\u201d that should improve the reproductive success of sons. Fawcett (2007) predicted that it is adaptive for females to adjust their sex ratio to favor sons in response to attractive males. Based on a computer model, he proposed that if sexual selection favors costly male traits, i.e. ornamentation, and costly female preferences, females should produce more male offspring when they mate with an attractive male compared to an unattractive male. Fawcett proposed that there is a direct correlation between female bias for male offspring and attractiveness of their mate. Computer simulations have costs and constraints, and selection may be weaker in natural populations than it was in Fawcett's study. While his results provide support for the Trivers-Willard hypothesis that animals adaptively adjust the sex ratio of offspring due to environmental variables, further empirical studies are needed to see if sex ratio is adjusted in response to mate attractiveness.",

Sexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances. Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences. Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex. Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex. For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate. Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females. Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.",

Some of the factors that affect how females select their potential mates for reproduction include voice pitch, facial shape, muscular appearance, and height. Several studies suggest that there is a link between hormone levels and partner selection among humans. In a study measuring female attraction to males with varying levels of masculinity, it was established that women had a general masculinity preferences for men's voices, and that the preference for masculinity was greater in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle than in the non-fertile phase. There is further evidence from the same study that in fertile stages of the menstrual cycle, women also had a preference for other masculine traits such as body size, facial shape, and dominant behavior, which are indicators of both fertility and health. This study did not exclude males with feminine traits from being selected, however, as feminine traits in men indicate a higher probability of long-term relationship commitment, and may be one of several survival strategies. Further research also backs up the idea of using phenotypic traits as a means of assessing a potential mates fitness for reproduction as well as assessing whether a partner has high genetic quality.",

Males have such strong receptor capabilities they can sense a female's pheromones within 300 feet, and the pheromones are specific to each so that moths avoid mating with the wrong species. Females release pheromones from a specialized gland in the abdomen to attract males. Males follow the scent of an attractive pheromone, but as they fly they lose specificity and care less about which scent they follow. The attractiveness of a female's pheromone matters less than her ability to make a male smell her scent first before he senses that of another female. Male pheromones convey more detailed information about age, reproductive fitness, and ancestry. Males have a special gene in their antenna that mutates in response to changes in female pheromones. This adaptation to species-specific changes helps ensure that reproduction occurs. Tiny feathery tips along the antenna pick up the slightest hint of pheromone released by females to guide males to their mates. Genes that allow for more refined antenna tips will lead to more reproductively fit males.",

Estrus evolved to facilitate reproduction and maximize reproductive success, or the success of passing on one's genes by producing offspring that are most likely to survive and reproduce themselves. The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that motivation and desire to mate should increase during the fertile window, and that females should seek and attract the best possible mate at their highest fertility. An ideal mate could have many qualities: resources to care for offspring, the physical ability and social status to protect a mate and offspring, a compatible personality for a long-term pair bond, etc. Evolutionary theory and sexual selection theory suggest that an organism\u2019s top priority should be to maximize survival and reproductive success. Thus, the ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women possess a dual sexuality, where during the fertile window, a woman should prioritize attracting and choosing a mate with the best genetic quality, or \u201cgood genes\u201d, since this is the only time she can become pregnant and pass on heritable genetic qualities to her offspring. However, at low-fertility, a woman should prioritize a mate with \"good parenting\" traits, such as willingness and ability to invest in parenting, resources to devote to offspring, and compatibility for a long-term partnership. These differing traits are sometimes referred to as the \"sexy cad\" vs. the \"good dad\".",

The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal innovation in male senders, in a similar way to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that successful calls are better able to match some 'hidden preference' in the female.

The skin itself increases vulnerability to predators due to its conspicuousness, as well as to infection. Additionally, the increased attention from males also puts females at a risk of injury through male aggression. In terms of the cost to males, mate guarding has been found to significantly reduce foraging in male baboons, therefore reducing their available food. Additionally, males expend effort in both grooming and consorting the female with whom they are mating, as well as warding off other males; the more attractive the female is, the greater the male-male competition, therefore increasing the risk to the male, as fights between baboons are potentially lethal.",

Among mantises, cannibalism by female \"Pseudomantis albofimriata\" improves fecundity, overall growth, and body condition.

This reproductive success was largely due to the increased energy uptake by cannibalizing males and investing that additional energy in the development of larger, higher-quality egg cases.

As symmetry appears to reflect an abundance of desirable traits held by the male in question, it is self-evident that such males are more desirable to females who are seeking high quality mates. In such, during ovulation, females show a strong preference for symmetrical males as they are reaching peak fertility.
