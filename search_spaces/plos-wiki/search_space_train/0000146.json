This could lead to many more discoveries in disease control for \"Ae. albopictus\" and other mosquito species. In addition, due to the cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by \"Wolbachia\", the artificial infection of males can serve as a biological control as they are unable to reproduce successfully with uninfected females (unidirectional CI). When artificially infected males are unable to reproduce, the population size can be controlled, thereby reducing the transmission of the harmful disease of interest. Artificial infection of males is achieved by the removal of cytoplasm from infected oocytes, which is then transferred into embryos prior to the blastoderm stage.",

In many insect species, such as \"Drosophila melanogaster\", researchers found that a natural infection with the bacteria strain \"Wolbachia\" \"pipientis\" increases the fitness of the host by increasing resistance to RNA viral infections. Robert L. Glaser and Mark A. Meola investigated \"Wolbachia\"-induced resistance to West Nile virus (WNV) in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" (fruit flies). Two groups of fruit flies were naturally infected with \"Wolbachia.\" Glaser and Meola then cured one group of fruit flies of \"Wolbachia using\" tetracycline. Both the infected group and the cured groups were then infected with WNV. \u00a0Flies infected with \"Wolbachia\" were found to have a changed phenotype that caused resistance to WNV. The phenotype was found to be caused by a \u201cdominant, maternally transmitted, cytoplasmic factor\u201d. The WNV-resistance phenotype was then reversed by curing the fruit flies of \"Wolbachia.\" Since \"Wolbachia\" is also maternally transmitted, it was found that the WNV-resistant phenotype is directly related to the \"Wolbachia\" infection. West Nile virus is transmitted to humans and animals through the Southern house mosquito, \"Culex quinquefasciatus.\" Glaser and Meola knew vector compatibility could be reduced through \"Wolbachia\" infection due to studies done with other species of mosquitoes, mainly, \"Aedes aegypti\". Their goal was to transfer WNV resistance to \"Cx. quinquefasciatus\" by inoculating the embryos of the mosquito with the same strain of \"Wolbachia\" that naturally occurred in the fruit flies. Upon infection, \"Cx. quinquefasciatus\" showed an increased resistance to WNV that was transferable to offspring. The ability to genetically modify mosquitoes in the lab and then have the infected mosquitoes transmit it to their offspring showed that it was possible to transmit the bacteria to wild populations to decrease human infections.",

In the natural environment, \"Wolbachia\" and the Asian tiger mosquito are in a symbiotic relationship, so both species benefit from each other and can evolve together. The relationship between \"Wolbachia\" and its host might not have always been mutualistic, as \"Drosophila\" populations once experienced decreased fecundity in infected females, suggesting that \"Wolbachia\" evolved over time so that infected individuals would actually reproduce much more. The mechanism by which \"Wolbachia\" is inherited through maternal heredity is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. This changes the gamete cells of males and females, making some individuals unable to mate with each other. Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists, \"Wolbachia\" infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a population exposed to \"Wolbachia\" transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations. This is called population replacement, where the population\u2019s overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype. This shows how populations of Asian tiger mosquitoes can vary in number of \"Wolbachia\"-infected individuals, based on how often the infection is transmitted.

Environmental changes such as deforestation could increase local temperatures in the highlands thus could enhance the vectorial capacity of the anopheles. Anopheles mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of a number of diseases in the world, such as, malaria, lymphatic filariasis and viruses that can cause such ailments, like the O'nyong'nyong virus. Environmental changes, climate variability, and climate change are such factors that could affect biology and ecology of Anophelse vectors and their disease transmission potential. Climate change is expected to lead to latitudinal and altitudinal temperature increases. Global warming projections indicate that the best estimate of surface air warming for a \u201chigh scenario\u201d is 4 C, with a likely range of 2.4-6.4 C by 2100. A temperature increase of this size would alter the biology and the ecology of many mosquito vectors and the dynamics of the diseases they transmit such as malaria. Arthropods critically depend on ambient temperature for survival and development, and their distribution range is limited by the temperature. Climate warming or any factor that alters the microclimate conditions of Anopheles mosquitoes (e.g., deforestation) in the highlands may facilitate the persistence of the mosquito population. Climate warming can mediate mosquito physiology and metabolic rate because metabolic rate increases exponentially rather than linearly with temperature ectotherms. Anopheles mosquitoes in highland areas are to experience a larger shift in their metabolic rate due to the climate change. This climate change is due to the deforestation in the highland areas where these mosquitoes dwell. When temperature rises, the larvae take a shorter time to mature and, consequently, there is a greater capacity to produce more offspring. Microclimatic changes in human homes caused by the effects of deforestation can also significantly shorten the duration of the mosquitoes' gonotrophic cycle by 1.7 days (4.6 vs 2.9 days) The gonotrophic cycle is the period between the taking of a blood meal by a mosquito, including the digestion of the blood meal, until oviposition or egg laying. The decrease of the gonotrophic cycles implies an increase of the biting frequency from an average of once every five days to once every three days.

In competitive situations, an infection with sporozoans can also reduce the biological fitness of other uninfected mosquitoes. However, the use of the parasites as an effective biological remedy to control mosquito populations is implausible because the host must reach the adult stage for the transmission of the parasites.",

The mechanism by which \"Wolbachia\" is inherited through maternal heredity is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. This changes the gamete cells of males and females, making some individuals unable to mate with each other. Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists, \"Wolbachia\" infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males.

Infrequently, however, other arboviruses have become established as a human disease and spread in a mosquito\u2013human\u2013mosquito cycle, like the yellow fever virus and the dengue fever virus (both flaviviruses), and the chikungunya virus (a togavirus). Though the reason for the pandemic is unknown, dengue, a related arbovirus that infects the same species of mosquito vectors, is known in particular to be intensified by urbanization and globalization. Zika is primarily spread by \"Aedes aegypti\" mosquitoes, and can also be transmitted through sexual contact or blood transfusions. The basic reproduction number (\"R\", a measure of transmissibility) of Zika virus has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 6.6.",

Examples are the Zika virus, chikungunya virus, yellow fever and dengue fever. The re-emergence of the viruses has been at a faster rate, and over a wider geographic area, than in the past. The rapid re-emergence is due to expanding global transportation networks, the mosquito's increasing ability to adapt to urban settings, the disruption of traditional land use and the inability to control expanding mosquito populations. Like malaria, other arboviruses do not have a vaccine. The only exception is yellow fever. Prevention is focused on reducing the adult mosquito populations, controlling mosquito larvae and protecting individuals from mosquito bites. Depending on the mosquito vector, and the affected community, a variety of prevention methods may be deployed at one time.",

At low prevalence of \"Wolbachia\", the probability for an uninfected female to lose progeny because of mating with an infected male is fairly low. This loss of uninfected individuals is outweighed by the loss of infection due to the incomplete \"Wolbachia\" transmission. If the prevalence of CI-inducing \"Wolbachia\" is high enough, the probability for an uninfected female to mate with an infected male is high and it is thus preferable for a female to be infected.  Therefore, there is an \"invasion threshold\" for the spread of \"Wolbachia\" in an uninfected population, which depends on the transmission rate of the infection and the portion of incompatible progeny which survive until they can reproduce (the strength of CI), as well as on the fitness cost of \"Wolbachia\" infection to the female. Below this threshold the invaders will die out, above this threshold the prevalence will reach a stable equilibrium. Typical thresholds in real populations are around 10% (See Fine and Stouthamer et al.).",

Previously, in July 2015, Oxitec had published results of a test in the Juazeiro region of Brazil, of so-called \"self-limiting\" mosquitoes, to fight dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. They concluded that mosquito populations were reduced by over 90% in the test region. Male genetically modified mosquitoes mate with females in the wild and transmit a self-limiting gene that causes the resulting offspring to die before reaching adulthood and thus diminishes the local mosquito population.

Malaysia is still undecided on the issue, with doctors there letting the mother make the decision whether or not to abort. Rentokil, a Malaysian pest company, has designed an Integrated Mosquito Management (IMM) program to curb the spread of Aedes mosquito.
