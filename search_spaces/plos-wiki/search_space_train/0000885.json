The diverse genome-wide repeats are derived from transposable elements, which are now understood to \"jump\" about different genomic locations, without transferring their original copies. Subsequent shuttling of the same sequences over numerous generations ensures their multiplicity throughout the genome. The limited recombination of the sequences between two distinct sequence elements known as conservative site-specific recombination (CSSR) results in inversions of the DNA segment, based on the arrangement of the recombination recognition sequences on the donor DNA and recipient DNA. Again, the orientation of two of the recombining sites within the donor DNA molecule relative to the asymmetry of the intervening DNA cleavage sequences, known as the crossover region, is pivotal to the formation of either inverted repeats or direct repeats. Thus, recombination occurring at a pair of inverted sites will invert the DNA sequence between the two sites. Very stable chromosomes have been observed with comparatively fewer numbers of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between chromosome stability and the number of repeats. Terminal inverted repeats have been observed in the DNA of various eukaryotic transposons, even though their source remains unknown. Inverted repeats are principally found at the origins of replication of cell organism and organelles that range from phage plasmids, mitochondria, and eukaryotic viruses to mammalian cells. The replication origins of the phage G4 and other related phages comprise a segment of nearly 139 nucleotide bases that include three inverted repeats that are essential for replication priming.",

            "document": "Copy-number variation . One type of non-homologous based mechanism is the non-homologous end joining or micro-homology end joining mechanism. These mechanisms are also involved in repairing double stranded breaks but require no homology or limited micro-homology. When these strands are repaired, oftentimes there are small deletions or insertions added into the repaired strand. It is possible that retrotransposons are inserted into the genome through this repair system. If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, meiotic recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another mechanism is the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves sister chromatids that have both lost its telomeric region due to double stranded breaks. It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one dicentric chromosome, and then segregate into two different nuclei. Because pulling the dicentric chromosome apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle. The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading to an increase in copy number. The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching. During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the lagging strand is required to unclamp and re-clamp the replication region continuously. When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be \u2018confused\u2019 when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again. Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and it is unlikely that the polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.",

This is exemplified in \"E. coli\", where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity. Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion. Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats. Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats. The instability results from the tendency of inverted repeats to fold into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities.

When a model of replicating molecules was created, it was found that, for effective storage of information, macromolecules on prebiotic Earth could not exceed a certain threshold length. This problem is known as the error threshold problem. It arises because replication is an imperfect process, and during each replication event, there is a risk of incorporating errors into a new sequence, leading to the creation of a quasispecies. In a system that is deprived of high-fidelity replicases and error-correction mechanisms, mutations occur with a high probability. As a consequence, the information stored in a sequence can be lost due to the rapid accumulation of errors, a so-called error catastrophe. Moreover, it was shown that the genome size of any organism is roughly equal to the inverse of mutation rate per site per replication. Therefore, a high mutation rate imposes a serious limitation on the length of the genome. To overcome this problem, a more specialized replication machinery that is able to copy genetic information with higher fidelity is needed. Manfred Eigen suggested that proteins are necessary to accomplish this task. However, to encode a system as complex as a protein, longer nucleotide sequences are needed, which increases the probability of a mutation even more and requires even more complex replication machinery. This vicious circle is known as Eigen's Paradox.",

One of the most well known examples of a short copy number variation is the tri-nucleotide repeat of the CAG base pairs in the Huntingtin gene, the gene that is responsible for the neurological disorder Huntington's disease. For this particular case, once the CAG tri-nucleotide repeats more than 36 times, Huntington\u2019s disease will likely develop in the individual and it will likely be inherited by his or her offspring. Interestingly, the number of repeats of the CAG tri-nucleotide is correlated with the age of onset of Huntington\u2019s disease. These types of short repeats are often thought to be due to errors in polymerase activity during replication including polymerase slippage, template switching, and fork switching which will be discussed in detail later. The short repeat size of these copy number variations lends itself to errors in the polymerase as these repeated regions are prone to misrecognition by the polymerase and replicated regions may be replicated again, leading to extra copies of the repeat. In addition, if these tri-nucleotide repeats are in the same reading frame in the coding portion of a gene, it may lead to a long chain of the same amino acid, possibly creating protein aggregates in the cell, and if these short repeats fall into the non-coding portion of the gene, it may affect gene expression and regulation. On the other hand, a variable number of repeats of entire genes is less commonly identified in the genome. One example of a whole gene repeat is the alpha-amylase 1 gene (AMY1) that encodes alpha-amylase which has a significant copy number variation between different populations with different diets. Although the specific mechanism that allows the AMY1 gene to increase or decrease its copy number is still a topic of debate, some hypotheses suggest that the non-homologous end joining or the microhomology-mediated end joining is likely responsible for these whole gene repeats. Repeats of entire genes has immediate effects on expression of that particular gene, and the fact that the copy number variation of the AMY1 gene has been related to diet is a remarkable example of recent human evolutionary adaptation. Although these are the general groups that copy number variations are grouped into, the exact number of base pairs copy number variations affect depends on the specific loci of interest. Currently, using data from all reported copy number variations, the mean size of copy number variant is around 118kb, and the median is around 18kb.",

Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, slippage in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, slippage changes in repetitive DNA are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations in other parts of the genome. Most slippage results in a change of just one repeat unit, and slippage rates vary for different allele lengths and repeat unit sizes, and within different species.

Rrm3p is also commonly associated with telomeric and subtelomeric DNA replication, in which its effects are thought to be direct. Although Rrm3p has specific associated sites within the genome, the absence of Rrm3p causes a genome-wide delay in replication including regions that are not Rrm3p-dependant. Furthermore, Rrm3p has been found to move globally in conjunction with proteins associated with the replisome. There is some debate within the literature as to whether Rrm3p is part of the replisome or if it is a protein that is recruited to genomic sites upon pausing of replication forks. Rrm3p is known to affect de novo telomere addition by influencing Pif1p activity on telomeres. Rrm3p is also seen to play a role in replication forks around rDNA, including replication and regulatory regions for transcription of 35S and 5S rRNA's. Rrm3p reduces the accumulation of rDNA circles in yeast, and mutations to Rrmp3 results in increased recombination of ribosomal DNA. This increase in recombination has been attributed to interactions between the protein Rrm3p and actual nucleotide base sequence from rDNA regions, rather than interactions due to the secondary structure formed by tandemly repeated DNA regions.

            "document": "Copy-number variation . Recent advances in biotechnology gave rise to many important techniques that are of extremely high genomic resolution and as a result, an increasing number of copy number variations in the genome have been reported. One of these advances involve using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array with around 1 megabase of intervals throughout the entire gene, BACs can also detect copy number variations in rearrangement hotspots allowing for the detection of 119 novel copy number variations. Throughout the past decade or so, high throughput genomic sequencing has revolutionized the field of human genomics and in silico studies have been performed to detect copy number variations in the genome. Reference sequences have been compared to other sequences of interest using fosmids by strictly controlling the fosmid clones to be 40kb. Sequencing end reads would provide adequate information to align the reference sequence to the sequence of interest, and any misalignments are easily noticeable thus concluded to be copy number variations within that region of the clone. This type of detection technique offers a high genomic resolution and precise location of the repeat in the genome, and it can also detect other types of structural variation such as inversions. In addition, another way of detecting copy number variation that can ensure high genomic resolution is using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Since the International HapMap project had begun, common SNPs that occur between four different populations from different continents have been sequenced and located. Due to the abundance of the human SNP data, the direction of detecting copy number variation has changed to utilize these SNPs. Relying on the fact that human recombination is relatively rare and that many recombination events occur in specific regions of the genome known as recombination hotspots, linkage disequilibrium can be used to identify copy number variations. Efforts have been made in associating copy number variations with specific haplotype SNPs by analyzing the linkage disequilibrium, using these associations, one is able to recognize copy number variations in the genome using SNPs as markers. One drawback of this method is that because SNPs in the International HapMap are not optimized for detecting copy number variations, therefore the data is biased towards large copy number variations. Next-generation sequencing has also been used recently to detect copy number variations with high genomic resolutions. Using whole-genome shot-gun sequencing data, assays have been developed to accurately detect and identify regions of duplications. On the other hand, it is very challenging to detect CNVs in targeted sequencing because it is extremely unlikely that breakpoints will occur inside the scant number of regions captured by a gene panel. Thus, soft-clipped reads and discordant reads are unlikely to be found in targeted sequencing. On average, there is about 1 SNP per 800 bit/s, so over a long enough region, B-allele frequencies (BAF) can be used to detect copy number changes. However, in targeted sequencing, there are not enough heterozygous variants within a short region to detect deviations from the expected 50% BAF. Lastly, high resolution microarrays that have copy number probes as well as SNP probes are the gold standard for detecting copy number changes down to 50 kbs with whole genome coverage. Accurately detecting, identifying, and categorizing copy number variations is extremely important because of the complications they bring to DNA sequencing. Traditionally, DNA sequencing relied heavily on sequencing short reads from a large genome and using any overlapping regions of the reads to combine the short reads to form longer reads. This will eventually be mapped together to give the sequence of the entire genome. However, the issues related to copy number variations arise in linking the overlapping regions together. By definition, copy number variation is a region of the genome duplicated a variable number of times in the population and due to the large variation between the number of times portions of the genome are duplicated, when mapping overlapping sequences, it becomes unclear whether or not a region is an overlap or a duplicated region. With all the challenges faced by sequencing to detect copy number variations, high resolution microarrays are the technology of choice.",

Larger genomic CNV changes involving losses or gains of thousands or millions of nucleotides encompassing one or several genes were thought to be exceptionally rare, and almost always involved in disease. Scherer's discovery of frequent CNV events found in the genomes of all cells in every individual, co-published with Charles Lee of Harvard in 2004, opened a new window for studies of natural genetic variation, evolution and disease.

There are hotspots in the genome where DNA sequences are prone to gaps and breaks after inhibition of DNA synthesis such as in the aforementioned checkpoint arrest. These sites are called fragile sites, and can occur commonly as naturally present in most mammalian genomes or occur rarely as a result of mutations, such as DNA-repeat expansion. Rare fragile sites can lead to genetic disease such as fragile X mental retardation syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Friedrich\u2019s ataxia, and Huntington\u2019s disease, most of which are caused by expansion of repeats at the DNA, RNA, or protein level. Although, seemingly harmful, these common fragile sites are conserved all the way to yeast and bacteria. These ubiquitous sites are characterized by trinucleotide repeats, most commonly CGG, CAG, GAA, and GCN. These trinucleotide repeats can form into hairpins, leading to difficulty of replication. Under replication stress, such as defective machinery or further DNA damage, DNA breaks and gaps can form at these fragile sites. Using a sister chromatid as repair is not a fool-proof backup as the surrounding DNA information of the n and n+1 repeat is virtually the same, leading to copy number variation. For example, the 16th copy of CGG might be mapped to the 13th copy of CGG in the sister chromatid since the surrounding DNA is both CGGCGGCGG\u2026, leading to 3 extra copies of CGG in the final DNA sequence.",

The diverse genome-wide repeats are derived from transposable elements, which are now understood to \"jump\" about different genomic locations, without transferring their original copies. Subsequent shuttling of the same sequences over numerous generations ensures their multiplicity throughout the genome. The limited recombination of the sequences between two distinct sequence elements known as conservative site-specific recombination (CSSR) results in inversions of the DNA segment, based on the arrangement of the recombination recognition sequences on the donor DNA and recipient DNA. Again, the orientation of two of the recombining sites within the donor DNA molecule relative to the asymmetry of the intervening DNA cleavage sequences, known as the crossover region, is pivotal to the formation of either inverted repeats or direct repeats. Thus, recombination occurring at a pair of inverted sites will invert the DNA sequence between the two sites. Very stable chromosomes have been observed with comparatively fewer numbers of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between chromosome stability and the number of repeats. Terminal inverted repeats have been observed in the DNA of various eukaryotic transposons, even though their source remains unknown. Inverted repeats are principally found at the origins of replication of cell organism and organelles that range from phage plasmids, mitochondria, and eukaryotic viruses to mammalian cells.

            "document": "Copy-number variation . One of the best-recognized theories that leads to copy number variations as well as deletions and inversions is non-allelic homologous recombinations. During meiotic recombination, homologous chromosomes pair up and form two ended double-stranded breaks leading to Holliday junctions. However, in the aberrant mechanism, during the formation of Holliday junctions, the double-stranded breaks are misaligned and the crossover lands in non-allelic positions on the same chromosome. When the Holliday junction is resolved, the unequal crossing over event allows transfer of genetic material between the two homologous chromosomes, and as a result, a portion of the DNA on both the homologues is repeated. Since the repeated regions are no longer segregating independently, the duplicated region of the chromosome is inherited. Another type of homologous recombination based mechanism that can lead to copy number variation is known as break induced replication. When a double stranded break occurs in the genome unexpectedly the cell activates pathways that mediate the repair of the break. Errors in repairing the break, similar to non-allelic homologous recombination, can lead to an increase in copy number of a particular region of the genome. During the repair of a double stranded break, the broken end can invade its homologous chromosome instead of rejoin the original strand. As in the non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism, an extra copy of a particular region is transferred to another chromosome, leading to a duplication event. Furthermore, cohesin proteins are found to aid in the repair system of double stranded breaks through clamping the two ends in close proximity which prevents interchromosomal invasion of the ends. If for any reason, such as activation of ribosomal RNA, cohesin activity is affected then there may be local increase in double stranded break repair errors.",

Three of the more common mechanisms of gene duplication are retroposition, unequal crossing over, and non-homologous segmental duplication. Retroposition is when the mRNA transcript of a gene is reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted into the genome at a different location. During unequal crossing over, homologous chromosomes exchange uneven portions of their DNA. This can lead to the transfer of one chromosome's gene to the other chromosome, leaving two of the same gene on one chromosome, and no copies of the gene on the other chromosome. Non-homologous duplications result from replication errors that shift the gene of interest into a new position. A tandem duplication then occurs, creating a chromosome with two copies of the same gene. Figure 1 to the left provides a good visual explanation of these three mechanisms. As the genome is replicated over many generations, the redundant gene's function will most likely evolve due to Genetic drift. This means that the gene will acquire mutations that change the overall function.

Other examples include aberrant chromosomal fragments, such as double minute chromosomes, that can arise during artificial gene amplifications or in pathologic processes (e.g., cancer cell transformation). Episomes in eukaryotes behave similarly to plasmids in prokaryotes in that the DNA is stably maintained and replicated with the host cell.

Others replicate through a bidirectional replication mechanism (\"Theta type\" plasmids). In either case, episomes remain physically separate from host cell chromosomes. Several cancer viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, are maintained as latent, chromosomally distinct episomes in cancer cells, where the viruses express oncogenes that promote cancer cell proliferation.

If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, meiotic recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another mechanism is the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves sister chromatids that have both lost its telomeric region due to double stranded breaks. It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one dicentric chromosome, and then segregate into two different nuclei. Because pulling the dicentric chromosome apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle. The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading to an increase in copy number. The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching. During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the lagging strand is required to unclamp and re-clamp the replication region continuously. When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be \u2018confused\u2019 when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again. Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and it is unlikely that the polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.",

            "document": "Genome evolution . Similar to gene duplication, whole genome duplication is the process by which an organism\u2019s entire genetic information is copied, once or multiple times which is known as polyploidy. This may provide an evolutionary benefit to the organism by supplying it with multiple copies of a gene thus creating a greater possibility of functional and selectively favored genes. In 1997, Wolfe & Shields gave evidence for an ancient duplication of the \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" (Yeast) genome. It was initially noted that this yeast genome contained many individual gene duplications. Wolfe & Shields hypothesized that this was actually the result of an entire genome duplication in the yeast\u2019s distant evolutionary history. They found 32 pairs of homologous chromosomal regions, accounting for over half of the yeast's genome. They also noted that although homologs were present, they were often located on different chromosomes. Based on these observations, they determined that \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" underwent a whole genome duplication soon after its evolutionary split from \"Kluyveromyces\", a genus of ascomycetous yeasts. Over time, many of the duplicate genes were deleted and rendered non-functional. A number of chromosomal rearrangements broke the original duplicate chromosomes into the current manifestation of homologous chromosomal regions. This idea was further solidified in looking at the genome of yeast's close relative \"Ashbya gossypii\". Whole genome duplication is common in fungi as well as plant species. An example of extreme genome duplication is represented by the Common Cordgrass (\"Spartina anglica\") which is a dodecaploid, meaning that it contains 12 sets of chromosomes, in stark contrast to the human diploid structure in which each individual has only two sets of 23 chromosomes.",

It was previously known that repeated sequences on a chromosome increases the probability of non allelic homologous recombination. These repeated sequences could cause deletions, duplications, inversions, and inverted duplication chromosomes. The products of this mechanism from the sequence repeats is depicted in Figure 2. A study was done on the olfactory receptor gene clusters where they questioned if there was an association between normal rearrangement of 8p and the repeated inverted sequences. The researchers observed that the rearrangement of chromosomes was actually caused by the homologous recombination in the 8p-reps. Therefore, they concluded that the substrate used in order to make rearrangements at the intrachromosomal level are the genes for olfactory receptors. This discovery revealed the role that inverted duplicates have in affecting the development of structural variants. The mechanisms and ways in which structural variants are produced are important to better understand the development of these type of genetic variants.",

By intra-molecular homologous recombination of the chromosome, eccDNA are formed as well as ERCs. The process for intra-molecular homologous recombination is independent of chromosomal replication. The de novo generated circles had exact multiples of tandem copies of 2-kb fragments from cosmid templates and that the tandem organization was a prerequisite to circle formation. Looping out of organized ribosomal genes in intergenic nontranscribed spacers yielded either large or small repeat circles dependent on large or short repeats of the spacer. The Sgs1 gene mutations in yeast mother cells were shown to have accelerated aging, suggesting their function to cellular senescence. ERCs accumulate in old cells and mutations of Sgs1 were found to increase this accumulation, leading to the idea that ERCs lead to shorter lifespan of cells. The ERC accumulate in the mother cell during the budding process.

MALBAC utilizes five cycles of pre-amplification and primers containing a 27 nucleotide common sequence and an 8 nucleotide variable sequence to produce fragments of amplified DNA (amplicons) which loop back on themselves to prevent additional copying and cross-hybridization. These loops cannot be used as a template for amplification during MALBAC and therefore reduce the amplification bias commonly associated with the uneven exponential amplification of DNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction. MALBAC has been described to have better amplification uniformity than other methods of single sequencing, such as multiple displacement amplification (MDA). MDA does not utilize DNA looping and amplifies DNA in an exponential fashion, resulting in bias. Accordingly, the amplification bias associated with other single cell sequencing methods results in low coverage of the genome.

Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in positional cloning. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication, which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence.

Watson-Crick basepairing of the palindrome, and a break in the sequence may occur, creating an opportunity for priming DNA synthesis in the opposite direction.

The other way is to label newly synthesized DNA with chemically tagged nucleotides that become incorporated into the strands as they are synthesized, and then catch cells at different times during the duplication process and purify the DNA synthesized at each of these times using the chemical tag. In either case, we can measure the amount of the different DNA sequences along the length of the chromosome either directly using a machine that reads how much of each sequence is present or indirectly using a process called microarray hybridization.

However, replication does not start at all the different origins at once. Rather, there is a defined temporal order in which these origins fire. Frequently a few adjacent origins open up to duplicate a segment of a chromosome, followed some time later by another group of origins opening up in an adjacent segment. Replication does not necessarily start at exactly the same origin sites every time, but the segments appear to replicate in the same temporal sequence regardless of exactly where within each segment replication starts.
