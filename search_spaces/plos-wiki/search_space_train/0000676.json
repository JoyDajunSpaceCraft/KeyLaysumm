MicroRNA 4640 is a protein in humans that is encoded by the MIR4640 gene. microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

Although DCL1 is named for its homology with the metazoan protein Dicer, its role in miRNA biogenesis is somewhat different, due to substantial differences in miRNA maturation processes between plants and animals. Unlike Dicer, DCL1 is localized to the cell nucleus, where it initiates miRNA processing as the catalytic component of the so-called Dicing complex, which also contains HYL1, a double-stranded RNA binding protein, and a zinc-finger protein known as SE or SERRATE. Within the nucleus, Dicing complexes co-localize in Dicing bodies or D-bodies. In plants, DCL1 is responsible both for processing a primary miRNA to a pre-miRNA, and for then processing the pre-miRNA to a mature miRNA. In animals, the equivalents of these two steps are carried out by different proteins; pri-miRNA processing takes place in the nucleus by the ribonuclease Drosha as part of the Microprocessor complex, and processing to a mature miRNA takes place in the cytoplasm by Dicer to yield a mature miRNA.",

Recent studies show that human miRNA are also related to this pathway. Homothorax (Hth) and Teashirt (Tsh) are two DNA-binding transcription factors expressed in the Drosophila eye imaginal disc. Recent studies have shown that the Hth and Tsh which are found to be important in cell survival of the Drosophila anterior optimal disc participate in the regulation of the Bantam miRNA. It is concluded that the miRNA has an important function in the central pacemaker of the Drosophila circadian rhythm clock. To be more precise Bantam miRNA has an important relation with the clock component clk. Thus making it an important factor of study regarding its role in the Drosophila behavior.",

After year 2008, microRNAs (miRNAs) are identified as new players in regulating the expression of P-gp in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Some members of miRNAs decrease the expression of P-gp. For example, miR-200c down-regulates the expression of P-gp through JNK signaling pathway or ZEB1 and ZEB2; miR-145 down-regulates mRNA of P-gp by directly binding to the 3'-UTR of the gene of P-gp and thus suppresses the translation of P-gp. Some other members of miRNAs increase the expression of P-gp. For example, miR-27a up-regulates P-gp expression by suppressing Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP); alternatively, miR-27a can also directly bind to the promoter of P-gp gene, which works in a similar way with the mechanism of action of transcriptional factors.",

When siRNAs of the same 21-22 nucleotide size as \"lin-4\" and \"let-7\" were discovered in 1999 by Hamilton and Baulcombe in plants, the fields of RNAi and miRNAs suddenly converged. It seemed likely that the similarly sized miRNAs and siRNAs would use similar mechanisms. In a collaborative effort, the Mello and Ruvkun labs showed that the first known components of RNA interference and their paralogs, Dicer and the PIWI proteins, are used by both miRNAs and siRNAs. Ruvkun's lab in 2003 identified many more miRNAs, identified miRNAs from mammalian neurons, and in 2007 discovered many new protein-cofactors for miRNA function.  Ruvkun's laboratory has also discovered that an insulin-like signaling pathway controls C. elegans metabolism and longevity. Klass Johnson and Kenyon showed that the developmental arrest program mediated by mutations in \"age-1\" and \"daf-2\" increase C. elegans longevity. The Ruvkun lab established that these genes constitute an insulin like receptor and a downstream phosphatidylinositol kinase that couple to the \"daf-16\" gene product, a highly conserved Forkhead transcription factor. Homologues of these genes have now been implicated in regulation of human aging. These findings are also important for diabetes, since the mammalian orthologs of \"daf-16\" (referred to as FOXO transcription factors) are also regulated by insulin. The Ruvkun lab has used full genome RNAi libraries to discover a comprehensive set of genes that regulate aging and metabolism. Many of these genes are broadly conserved in animal phylogeny and are likely to reveal the neuroendocrine system that assesses and regulates energy stores and assigns metabolic pathways based on that status. Recently, the Ruvkun lab discovered a deep connection between longevity and small RNA pathways, with the production of germline specific small RNA factors induced in somatic cells in long lived mutant animals.",

            "document": "RNA interference . MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded non-coding RNAs that help regulate gene expression, particularly during development. The phenomenon of RNA interference, broadly defined, includes the endogenously induced gene silencing effects of miRNAs as well as silencing triggered by foreign dsRNA. Mature miRNAs are structurally similar to siRNAs produced from exogenous dsRNA, but before reaching maturity, miRNAs must first undergo extensive post-transcriptional modification. A miRNA is expressed from a much longer RNA-coding gene as a primary transcript known as a \"pri-miRNA\" which is processed, in the cell nucleus, to a 70-nucleotide stem-loop structure called a \"pre-miRNA\" by the microprocessor complex. This complex consists of an RNase III enzyme called Drosha and a dsRNA-binding protein DGCR8. The dsRNA portion of this pre-miRNA is bound and cleaved by Dicer to produce the mature miRNA molecule that can be integrated into the RISC complex; thus, miRNA and siRNA share the same downstream cellular machinery. First, viral encoded miRNA was described in EBV. Thereafter, an increasing number of microRNAs have been described in viruses. VIRmiRNA is a comprehensive catalogue covering viral microRNA, their targets and anti-viral miRNAs (see also VIRmiRNA resource: http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/virmirna/).",
