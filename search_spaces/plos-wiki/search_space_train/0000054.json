Case-control studies use subjects who already have a disease, trait or other condition and determine if there are characteristics of these patients that differ from those who do not have the disease or trait. In genetic case-control studies, the frequency of alleles or genotypes is compared between the cases and controls. The cases will have been diagnosed with the disease under study, or have the trait under test; the controls, who are either known to be unaffected, or who have been randomly selected from the population. A difference in the frequency of an allele or genotype of the polymorphism under test between the two groups indicates that the genetic marker may increase risk of the disease or likelihood of the trait, or be in linkage disequilibrium with a polymorphism which does. Haplotypes can also show association with a disease or trait. One of the earliest successes in this field was finding a single base mutation in the non-coding region of the APOC3 gene (apolipoprotein C3 gene) that associated with higher risks of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis using a case-control design.",

The most common approach of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two large groups of individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped for the majority of common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.",

The most common SNP epoxygenase variants are as follows. 1) CYP2C8*3 (30411A>G, rs10509681, Lys399Arg) converts arachidonic acid to 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET with a turnover rate less than half that of wild type CYP2C8; in a single recent report, male but not female carriers of the CYP2C8*3 allele had an increased risk of essential hypertension. Bearers of this SNP may or may not show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are its substrates such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam, and valdecoxib. 2) CYP2J2*7 (\u221276G>T, rs890293, upstream Promoter (genetics) site) has decreased binding of the Sp1 transcription factor resulting in its lowered expressionas and lowered levels of EETs in plasma. Carriers of this SNP among a Uygur population in China had a higher risk of coronary artery disease. However, CYP2J2*7 carriers showed no association with hypertension, heart attack, or stroke in a study of 5,740 participants of the cardiovascular cohort of the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer study; since other studies have afforded contradictory results, this allele is currently regarded as not associated with cardiovascular diseases (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance). Bearers of this SNP in a Chinese Population had a higher risk of younger onset of type 2 diabetes and among a Chinese Han population had a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. 3) CYP2C8*2 (11054A>T, rs11572103, Ile269Phe) and CYP2C8*4 (11041C>, rs1058930, variants have reduced arachidonic acid-metabolizing activity but have not been clearly associated with cardiovascular or other diseases. 4) CYPC28*4 (3608C>T, rs1058930, Ile264Met) has reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. It has not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but has a higher incidence in subjects with type II diabetes in a small sample of Caucasians in Germany. 5) The CYP2C9*2 (3608C>T, rs1799853, Arg144Cys) variant has a 50% reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolizing activity compared to CYP2C9 wild type ; carriers of it show no association with cardiovascular disease but exhibit poor metabolism of the anti-coagulating, \"blood-thining\" agent, warfarin. These carriers are susceptible to the gastrointestinal bleeding side effects of warfarin and the NSAID cited above. 6 ) CYP2C9*3 (42624A>C, rs1057910, Iso359Leu) encodes an expoxygenase with reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. This allele has not been directly associated with cardiovascular diseases but may be associated with the poor metabolism and therefore adverse reactions to warfarin, NSAID, sulfonylurea-containing oral hypoglycemic agents, and the anti-(epilepsy) drug, phenytoin. 7) CYP2C19*2 (19154G>A, rs4244285, Il264Met) and CYP2C19*3 (17948G>A, rs4986893, His212X) are loss-of-function null alleles; carriers of the CYP2C19*3 but not the CYP2C19*2 allele showed a \"reduced\" risk of developing essential hypertension in a large Korean population study. Bearers of null alleles would be expected to be poor metabolizers of several drugs which are CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 substrates. This is particularly the case with Clopidogrel, a drug used to block platelet activation, blood clotting, and thereby heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery occlusion in people at high risk of these events; CYP2C19 metabolizes clopidogrel to it active form. Consequently, patients with severe deficiencies in this CYP, i.e. bearers of CYP2C19*3 or CYP2C19*2 alleles, fail to gain protection from clopidogrel and have a higher risk of the cited cardiovascular events than clopidogrel-treated patients bearing wild type CYP2C19 alleles. 8) CYPC19*17 (-800C>T, rs12248560, site upstream gene promoter site) causes overproduction of its epoxygenase and thereby the ultra fast metabolism of arachidonic acid. Bearers of this allele have not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but clearly show a decreased risk of developing breast cancer and endometriosis possible because their rapid metabolism of estrogen leads to lower estrogen levels and thereby a lower risk of these estrogen-fueled diseases. These bearers also a higher rate of metabolism of, and therefore reduced responsiveness to, certain proton pump inhibitor and antidepressant drugs.",

Impaired NO production is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, erectile dysfunction, and migraine. In this regard, a large number of studies showed that polymorphisms in NOS3 gene affect the susceptibility to these diseases. Although NOS3 is a highly polymorphic gene, three genetic polymorphisms in this gene have been widely studied: the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) g.-786T>C (where \"g.\" denotes genomic change which results in a Glu298Asp change in the coded protein), located in NOS3 promoter and in exon 7, respectively, and the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) characterized by 27 bp repeat in intron 4. The C allele for the g.-786T>C polymorphism, which results in reduced eNOS expression and NO production, was associated with increased risk for hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetic nephropathy, and retinopathy, migraine, and erectile dysfunction, The presence of \u2018Asp\u2019 allele for the Glu298Asp polymorphism reduces eNOS activity, and was associated with higher susceptibility to hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus, migraine, and erectile dysfunction. The VNTR in intron 4 affects eNOS expression, and the susceptibility to hypertension, preeclampsia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Growing evidence supports the association of diseases with NOS3 haplotypes (combination of alleles in close proximity, within a DNA block). This approach may be more informative than the analysis of genetic polymorphisms one by one. Haplotypes including the SNPs g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp and the VNTR in intron 4 affected the susceptibility to hypertension, preeclampsia, and hypertension in diabetic subjects, NOS3 variants may also affect the responses to drugs that affect NO signaling, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (PDE5i). Statin treatment was more effective in increasing NO bioavailability in subjects carrying the CC genotype for the g.-786T>C polymorphism than in TT carriers. Hypertensive patients carrying the TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better antihypertensive responses to ACEi enalapril. Likewise, patients with erectile dysfunction carrying the C allele for g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better responses to PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil. Together, these studies suggest that statins, ACEi and PDE-5 inhibitors may restore an impaired NO production in subjects carrying the variant allele/genotype for g.-786T>C NOS3 polymorphism, thus attenuating the cardiovascular risk. In addition to analysis of genetic polymorphisms individually, haplotypes including the SNPs g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp and the VNTR in intron 4 were showen to affect the responses to sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction.",

Contrary to CYBB, CYBA supports a relatively high number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could influence the level of ROS generation. These SNPs were mainly associated with cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary heart disease (CHD) and also cerebral ischemic diseases. The first and most widely studied is the C242T polymorphism is located in exon 4 at position 214 from the ATG and resulting in a non conservative His72 substitution for a Tyr. Inoue et al. first found that the T allele of the C242 polymorphism might have a protective effect against CAD. Despite some evidence of the effect of this polymorphism on ROS generation at the cellular level, the association of the CYBA C242T polymorphism with cardiovascular diseases has been widely reported but with conflicting results. Single SNP analysis may explain the discrepancies among CYBA association studies. A global approach such as haplotype analysis is probably a better approach to understand the impact of CYBA genetic variability on diseases. CYBA variants together with polymorphism analysis of lipid metabolism or stress oxidant pathway genes are of great interest as well. However, for future investigations regarding the effect of these polymorphisms, it is crucial that the number of patients under study provide sufficient statistical power. In addition, genetics studies that include control of external factors should be extremely informative. Finally, since 2010 nine Chinese meta-analyses of the C242T polymorphism have been published in relation with CAD, hypertension atherosclerosis or diabetes and its complications and ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. The results from these meta-analyses were controversial. Several factors could influence these data: the search strategy, the identification of relevant studies (publication bias), the statistical analysis including a sufficient sampling, the prevalence of the studied polymorphism in the studied population [minor allele frequency (MAF)] and the type of population (population-based or not, for example). Results of these meta-analyses need to be confirmed with larger samples. In addition, a meta-analysis based on genome-wide association study data will be of great interest in the future.",

Over the past few years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of common diseases and has improved our understanding of the genetic basis of many complex traits. Traditional single SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) GWAS is the most commonly used method to find trait associated DNA sequence variants - associations between variants and one or more phenotypes of interest are investigated by studying individuals with different phenotypes and examining their genotypes at the position of each SNP individually. The SNPs for which one variant is statistically more common in individuals belonging to one phenotypic group are then reported as being associated with the phenotype. However, most complex common diseases involve small population-level contributions from multiple genomic loci. To detect such small effects as genome-wide significant, traditional GWAS rely on increased sample size e.g. to detect an effect which accounts for 0.1% of total variance, traditional GWAS needs to sample almost 30,000 individuals. Although the development of high throughput SNP genotyping technologies has lowered the cost and improved the efficiency of genotyping. Performing such a large scale study still costs considerable money and time. Recently, association analysis methods utilizing gene-based tests have been proposed that are based on the fact that variations in protein-coding and adjacent regulatory regions are more likely to have functional relevance. These methods have the advantage that they can account for multiple independent functional variants within a gene, with the potential to greatly increase the power to identify disease/trait associated genes. Also, imputation of ungenotyped markers using known reference panels(e.g. HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project) predicts genotypes at the missing or untyped markers thereby allowing one to accurately evaluate the evidence for association at genetic markers that are not directly genotyped (in addition to the typed markers) and has been shown to improve the power of GWAS to detect disease associated loci.",

While in the human host, the parasite spends most of its life cycle within hepatic cells and erythrocytes (in contrast to \"T. brucei\" which remains extracellular). As a result of its mainly intracellular niche, parasitized host cells which display parasite proteins must be modified to prevent destruction by the host immune defenses. In the case of \"Plasmodium\", this is accomplished via the dual purpose \"Plasmodium falciparum\" erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). PfEMP1 is encoded by the diverse family of genes known as the \"var\" family of genes (approximately 60 genes in all). The diversity of the gene family is further increased via a number of different mechanisms including exchange of genetic information at telomeric loci, as well as meiotic recombination. The PfEMP1 protein serves to sequester infected erythrocytes from splenic destruction via adhesion to the endothelium. Moreover, the parasite is able to evade host defense mechanisms by changing which \"var\" allele is used to code the PfEMP1 protein. Like \"T. brucei\", each parasite expresses multiple copies of one identical protein. However, unlike \"T. brucei\", the mechanism by which \"var\" switching occurs in \"P. falciparum\" is thought to be purely transcriptional. \"Var\" switching has been shown to take place soon after invasion of an erythrocyte by a \"P. falciparum\" parasite.

Before the advent of modern medicine, the carriers of the rarer allele (e.g. RhD-negative women in a population of RhD positives or RhD-positive men in a population of RhD negatives) were at a disadvantage as some of their children (RhD-positive children born to preimmunised RhD-negative mothers) were at a higher risk of fetal or newborn death or health impairment from hemolytic disease. It was suggested that higher tolerance of RhD-positive heterozygotes against \"Toxoplasma\"-induced impairment of reaction time and \"Toxoplasma\"-induced increase of risk of traffic accident could counterbalance the disadvantage of the rarer allele and could be responsible both for the initial spread of the RhD allele among the RhD-negative population and for a stable RhD polymorphism in most human populations. It was also suggested that differences in the prevalence of \"Toxoplasma\" infection between geographical regions (0\u201395%) could also explain the striking variation in the frequency of RhD-negative alleles between populations. According to some parasitologists, it is possible that the better psychomotor performance of RhD-negative subjects in the \"Toxoplasma\"-free population could be the reason for spreading of the \u201cd allele\u201d (deletion) in the European population. In contrast to the situation in Africa and certain (but not all) regions of Asia, the abundance of wild cats (definitive hosts of \"Toxoplasma gondii\") in Europe was very low before the advent of the domestic cat.",

Loss of heterozygosity, loss of entire alleles from chromosomes, partial chromosomal addition and deletion and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been associated with uveal melanoma metastatic lesions. In particular, chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8 have been extensively studied for their association with shorter survival time and development of metastatic disease. While genetic aberrations in chromosomes 1, 6 and 8 have not independently been able to predict disease progression, cytogenetic profiling of chromosome 3 has uncovered an important genetic region highly associated with metastatic onset in uveal melanoma patients. Chromosome 3 abnormalities have been analyzed using multiple techniques, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromosomal in situ hybridization (CISH), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), SNP, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and microsatellite analysis. Despite a wealth of data that has identified the association of chromosome 3 mutation with UM metastasis, the clinical application of this data has yet to be realized. Reasons for the uncertainty of chromosome 3 clinical use include 1) high false-positive rates (ranging from 5-22%), 2) high false-negative rates (ranging from 4-50%), 3) high technical failure rates (up to 50%) due to the large tissue requirement for current analysis techniques, and 4) the adverse effects of cellular heterogeneity on chromosome 3 cytogenetic analysis.

In vitro functional analyses showed that this SNP enhanced the transcriptional level of the ITIH3 gene.

The gene has been shown to be related to the proinflammatory process of immune response. ITIH3 makes a complex with the locally synthesized hyaluronan (HA) and interacts with inflammatory cells. The ITIH3-HA complex has been reported to be involved in inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases.

The MYC promoter, which is located at a short distance downstream of the 8q24 region, is perhaps the most studied oncogene due to its association with a myriad of diseases. Normal functioning of the MYC promoter ensures that cells divide regularly. The study postulates that the 8q region, which underwent a chromosomal translocation in humans, could have moved an essential enhancer for the MYC promoter. This areas around this region could have been subjected to recombination that may have hidden the essential MYC enhancer within the gene desert through time, although its enhancing effects are still very much retained. This analysis stems from disease associations observed in several mice species where this region is retained at proximity to the MYC promoter. Thus, the 8q24 gene desert should have been somewhat linked to the MYC promoter. The desert resembles a stable gene desert that has had very little recombination after the translocation event. Thus, a potential hypothesis is that SNPs affecting this region disrupt the important tissue-specific genes with the stable gene desert, which could explain the risks of cancer in various tissue forms. This effect of hidden enhancer elements can also be observed in other locations in the genome. For instance, SNPs in the 5p13.1 deregulate the PTGER4 coding region, leading to Crohn\u2019s Disease. Another affected region in the 9p21 gene desert causes several coronary artery diseases. However, none of these risk-conferring gene deserts seem to be affected as much as the 8q24 regions. Current studies are still unsure about the SNP-affected processes in the 8q24 region that result in particularly amplified responses to the MYC promoter. With the aid of a more accessible population and more specific markers for genome wide association mapping, an increasing number of risk alleles are now being marked in gene deserts, where small, isolated, and seemingly-unimportant regions of genes may moderate important genes.",

Only one high-activity allele is required to be lactase persistent. Lactase persistence behaves as a dominant trait because half levels of lactase activity are sufficient to show significant digestion of lactose. Cis-acting transcriptional silence of the lactase gene is responsible for the hypolactasia phenotype. Furthermore, studies show that only eight cases were found where the parents of a child with lactase persistence were both hypolactasic. While a variety of genetic, as well as nutritional, factors determine lactase expression, no evidence has been found for adaptive alteration of lactase expression within an individual in response to changes in lactose consumption levels. The two distinct phenotypes of hypolactasia are: Phenotype I, characterized by reduced synthesis of precursor LPH, and phenotype II, associated with ample precursor synthesis, but reduced conversion of the protein to its mature molecular form.

TbG causes over 98% of reported cases. Both are usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and are most common in rural areas. Initially, in the first stage of the disease, there are fevers, headaches, itchiness and joint pains. This begins one to three weeks after the bite. Weeks to months later the second stage begins with confusion, poor coordination, numbness and trouble sleeping. Diagnosis is via finding the parasite in a blood smear or in the fluid of a lymph node. A lumbar puncture is often needed to tell the difference between first and second stage disease. Prevention of severe disease involves screening the population at risk with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage is with the medications pentamidine or suramin. Treatment of the second stage involves eflornithine or a combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine for TbG. While melarsoprol works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.

In later stages, the parasite crosses the blood brain barrier, resulting in a devastating and usually fatal outcome. As a result of replicating in the bloodstream, \"T. brucei\" parasites are subjected to numerous host defense mechanisms including soluble components of the immune system ( i.e. complement), as well as cellular components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In order to protect itself from host defenses, the parasite decorates itself with a dense, homogeneous coat (~10^7 molecules) of glycoprotein known as the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG).  In the early stages of invasion, the dense protein coat is sufficient to protect the parasite from immune detection. However, the host eventually identifies the VSG as a foreign antigen and mounts an attack against the microbe. The \"T. brucei\" parasite has evolved an elegant mechanism to display a completely new coat of VSG antigen, rendering it once again invisible to the host\u2019s immune system. The parasite\u2019s genome has over 1,000 genes that code for different variants of the VSG protein. VSG genes can be found on the subtelomeric portion of large chromosomes, or on intermediate chromosomes. VSG genes also exist in arrays and many exist as pseudogenes.  There is a hierarchy by which the VSG genes are activated. Telomeric VSGs are activated first, followed by array VSGs, and finally pseudogene VSGs. Switching of VSG proteins occurs at a rate substantially higher than the background mutation rate of other genes in the parasite (suggesting that it is a regulated process). The process is partially dependent on homologous recombination of DNA, which is mediated in part by the interaction of the \"T. brucei\" BRCA2 gene with RAD51 (however, this is not the only responsible mechanism, as BRCA2 variants still display some VSG switching). In addition to homologous recombination, transcriptional regulation also plays an important role in antigen switching. This is in contrast to other pathogens, where antigenic variation is typically mediated by DNA rearrangements or transcriptional regulation. The process by which VSG switching occurs has not been fully elucidated, but it is known that activation of VSGs requires recombination of the VSG genes into a VSG expression site (ES). The ES consists of a single \"vsg\" gene flanked by an upstream array of 70 base pair repeats and expression site associated genes (ESAGs). \"T. brucei\" expresses one VSG at any given time, and the active VSG can either be selected by activation of a previously silent ES, or by recombination of a VSG sequence into the active ES (see the figure \"Mechanisms of VSG Switching in \"T. brucei\"\"). Although the biological triggers that result in VSG switching are not fully known, mathematical modeling suggests that the ordered appearance of different VSG variants is controlled by at least two key parasite-derived factors: differential activation rates of parasite VSG and density-dependent parasite differentiation.",

While original hypotheses stated that co-infection with multiple parasites would impair the host\u2019s immune response to a single parasite and increase susceptibility to clinical disease, studies have yielded contrasting results. For example, one study in Senegal showed that the risk of clinical malaria infection was increased in helminth-infected children in comparison to helminth-free children while other studies have failed to reproduce such results, and even among laboratory mouse experiments the effect of helminths on malaria is variable. Some hypotheses and studies suggest that helminth infections may protect against cerebral malaria due to the possible modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines responses. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying this supposed increased susceptibility to disease are unknown. For example, helminth infections cause potent and highly polarized immune response characterized by increased T-helper cell type 2 (T2) cytokine and Immunoglobulin E(IgE) production. However, the effect of such responses on the human immune response is unknown.

While in the human host, the parasite spends most of its life cycle within hepatic cells and erythrocytes (in contrast to \"T. brucei\" which remains extracellular). As a result of its mainly intracellular niche, parasitized host cells which display parasite proteins must be modified to prevent destruction by the host immune defenses. In the case of \"Plasmodium\", this is accomplished via the dual purpose \"Plasmodium falciparum\" erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). PfEMP1 is encoded by the diverse family of genes known as the \"var\" family of genes (approximately 60 genes in all). The diversity of the gene family is further increased via a number of different mechanisms including exchange of genetic information at telomeric loci, as well as meiotic recombination. The PfEMP1 protein serves to sequester infected erythrocytes from splenic destruction via adhesion to the endothelium. Moreover, the parasite is able to evade host defense mechanisms by changing which \"var\" allele is used to code the PfEMP1 protein. Like \"T. brucei\", each parasite expresses multiple copies of one identical protein. However, unlike \"T. brucei\", the mechanism by which \"var\" switching occurs in \"P. falciparum\" is thought to be purely transcriptional. \"Var\" switching has been shown to take place soon after invasion of an erythrocyte by a \"P. falciparum\" parasite.
