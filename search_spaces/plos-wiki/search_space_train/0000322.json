Light excites melanopsin-containing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells which signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Excitation of the RHT signals the release of glutamate which is received by NMDA receptors on SCN, resulting in a calcium influx into the SCN. Calcium induces the activity of Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, resulting in the activation of PKA, PKC, and CK2. These kinases then phosphorylate CREB in a circadian manner that further regulates downstream gene expression. The phosphorylated CREB recognizes the cAMP Response Element and serves as a transcription factor for Per1 and Per2, two genes that regulate the mammalian circadian clock. This induction of PER protein can entrain the circadian clock to light/dark cycles inhibits its own transcription via a transcription-translation feedback loop which can advance or delay the circadian clock. However, the responsiveness of PER1 and PER2 protein induction is only significant during the subjective night.",

These \"frq\" transcripts both have capacity to encode two FRQ proteins, a long form of 989 amino acids (lFRQ) and a short form of 890 amino acids (sFRQ); both lFRQ and sFRQ are required for strong rhythmicity although the clock is able to persist at certain temperatures, albeit with a weaker rhythmicity, with just one of the proteins present. The choice of which protein is made is the result of temperature-dependent splicing of the primary transcript such that it includes or excludes the ATG start codon for lFRQ. The two forms of FRQ provide the \"Neurospora\" clock a greater range of temperatures over which it can operate optimally. An increase in temperature leads to increased expression of lFRQ, while sFRQ is unaffected. Warmer temperatures induce more efficient splicing of an intron in the translation start site.

In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by phosphorylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and histone acetylation and deacetylation, the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. Methylation of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes \"histone acetyltransferases\" (HAT) and \"histone deacetylases\" (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop.

Circadian oscillators may be regulated by phosphorylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and histone acetylation and deacetylation, the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. Methylation of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence.

Two years later, Albrecht et al. found genetic evidence to support this result when they discovered that mPer1 mutants are not able to advance the clock in response to a late-night light pulse (ZT22) and that mPer2 mutants are not able to delay the clock in response to an early night light pulse (ZT14). Thus, mPer1 and mPer2 are necessary for the daily resetting of the circadian clock to normal environmental light cues.",

In case of the fungus \"Neurospora crassa\", the circadian clock is controlled by two light-sensitive domains, known as the white-collar-complex (WCC) and the LOV domain vivid (VVD-LOV). WCC is primarily responsible for the light-induced transcription on the control-gene frequency (FRQ) under day-light conditions, which drives the expression of VVD-LOV and governs the negative feedback loop onto the circadian clock. By contrast, the role of VVD-LOV is mainly modulatory and does not directly affect FRQ.",

The kappa (\u03ba) and lambda (\u03bb) chains of the immunoglobulin light chain loci rearrange in a very similar way, except that the light chains lack a D segment. In other words, the first step of recombination for the light chains involves the joining of the V and J chains to give a VJ complex before the addition of the constant chain gene during primary transcription. Translation of the spliced mRNA for either the kappa or lambda chains results in formation of the Ig \u03ba or Ig \u03bb light chain protein. The immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus contains protein-coding genes that can be lost with its rearrangement. This is based on a physiological mechanism and is not pathogenetic for leukemias or lymphomas. However, the rearrangement of several lambda variable subgenes can activate expression of an overlapping miRNA gene, which has consequences for gene expression regulation.",

Tobin\u2019s lab was studying promoter fragments that contribute to light regulation of light-harvesting Chlorophyll A/B Binding Protein (LHCB), and noticed DNA-binding activity that had affinity for a specific light-responsive fragment of the LHCB promoter. This DNA-binding activity was designated as CA-1 because the binding is mostly to cytosine and adenine-rich sequences. They found that this binding activity is necessary for phytochrome response. They later found the gene responsible for this activity by screening the \"Arabidopsis\" expression library. CCA1 referred to the CA-1 clone, and now designated the gene responsible for this DNA binding activity. The evolution of circadian clocks in land plants is not understood, because circadian rhythms have received little attention in plants other than angiosperms.",

            "document": "Circadian rhythm . The central oscillator generates a self-sustaining rhythm and is driven by two interacting feedback loops that are active at different times of day. The morning loop consists of CCA1 (Circadian and Clock-Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in \"Arabidopsis\", as well as PRR 7 and 9 (Pseudo-Response Regulators.) The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in regulation of flowering time genes. When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop. Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early morning, whereas TOC1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop. This finding and further computational modeling of TOC1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals.",

These include: the light chain variable region (V), joining region (J), and constant region (C) gene segments. The variable region of light is therefore encoded by the rearrangement of VJ segments. The light chain can be either kappa,\u03ba or lambda,\u03bb. This process takes place at the level of mRNAs processing. Random rearrangements and recombinations of the gene segments at DNA level to form one kappa or lambda light chain occurs in an orderly fashion. As a result, \"a functional variable region gene of a light chain contains two coding segments that are separated by a non-coding DNA sequence in unrearranged germ-line DNA\" (Barbara et al., 2007). Interestingly, the immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus contains protein-coding genes that can be lost with its rearrangement. This is based on a physiological mechanism and is not pathogenetic for leukemias or lymphomas.

            "document": "PER1 . The PER1 protein is important to the maintenance of circadian rhythms in cells, and may also play a role in the development of cancer. This gene is a member of the period family of genes. It is expressed with a daily oscillating circadian rhythm, or an oscillation that cycles with a period of approximately 24 hours. PER1 is most notably expressed in the region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the primary circadian pacemaker in the mammalian brain. PER1 is also expressed throughout mammalian peripheral tissues. Genes in this family encode components of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. Circadian expression of PER1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus will free-run in constant darkness, meaning that the 24-hour period of the cycle will persist without the aid of external light cues. Subsequently, a shift in the light/dark cycle evokes a proportional shift of gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The time of gene expression is sensitive to light, as light during a mammal's subjective night results in a sudden increase in per expression and thus a shift in phase in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Alternative splicing has been observed in this gene; however, these variants have not been fully described. There is some disagreement between experts over the occurrence of polymorphisms with functional significance. Many scientists state that there are no known polymorphisms of the human PER1 gene with significance at a population level that results in measurable behavioral or physiological changes. Still, some believe that even silent mutations can cause significant behavioral phenotypes,and result in major phase changes.",
