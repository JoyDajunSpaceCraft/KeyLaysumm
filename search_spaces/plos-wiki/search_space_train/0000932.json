Recently, a relatively high prevalence of PTPN11 mutations (24%) were detected by next-generation sequencing in a cohort of NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia patients, although the prognostic significance of such associations has not been clarified. These data suggests that Shp2 may be a proto-oncogene. However, it has been reported that PTPN11/Shp2 can act as either tumor promoter or suppressor. In aged mouse model, hepatocyte-specific deletion of PTPN11/Shp2 promotes inflammatory signaling through the STAT3 pathway and hepatic inflammation/necrosis, resulting in regenerative hyperplasia and spontaneous development of tumors. Decreased PTPN11/Shp2 expression was detected in a subfraction of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. The bacterium \"Helicobacter pylori\" has been associated with gastric cancer, and this is thought to be mediated in part by the interaction of its virulence factor CagA with SHP2.",

For the majority of cancers, genome instability is reflected in a large frequency of mutations in the whole genome DNA sequence (not just the protein coding regions that are only 1.5% of the genome). In whole genome sequencing of different types of cancers, large numbers of mutations were found in two breast cancers (about 20,000 point mutations), 25 melanomas (9,000 to 333,000 point mutations) and a lung cancer (50,000 point mutations and 54,000 small additions and deletions). Genome instability is also referred to as an enabling characteristic for achieving endpoints of cancer evolution. Many of the somatic evolutionary studies have traditionally been focused on clonal expansion, as recurrent types of changes can be traced to illustrate the evolutionary path based on available methods. Recent studies from both direct DNA sequencing and karyotype analysis illustrate the importance of the high level of heterogeneity in somatic evolution. For the formation of solid tumors, there is an involvement of multiple cycles of clonal and non-clonal expansion. Even at the typical clonal expansion phase, there are significant levels of heterogeneity within the cell population, however, most are under-detected when mixed populations of cells are used for molecular analysis. In solid tumors, a majority of gene mutations are not recurrent types, and neither are the karyotypes. These analyses offer an explanation for the findings that there are no common mutations shared by most cancers.",

It is found in larger amounts than in healthy cells in a wide range of cancers including breast, prostate, bladder, uterine, and renal cancers, as well as melanoma and lymphoma. EZH2 is a gene suppressor, so when it becomes overexpressed, many tumor suppressor genes that are normally turned on, are turned off. Inhibition of EZH2 function shrinks malignant tumors in some reported cases because those tumor suppressor genes are not silenced by EZH2. EZH2 typically is not expressed in healthy adults; it is only found in actively dividing cells, like those active during fetal development. Because of this characteristic, overexpression of EZH2 can be used as a diagnostic marker of cancer and some neurodegenerative disorders. However, there are cases where it is difficult to tell whether overexpression of EZH2 is the cause of a disease, or simply a consequence. If it is only a consequence, targeting EZH2 for inhibition may not cure the disease. One example of a cancer pathway in which EZH2 plays a role is the pRB-E2F pathway. It is downstream from the pRB-E2F pathway, and signals from this pathway lead to EZH2 overexpression. Another important characteristic of EZH2 is that when EZH2 is overexpressed, it can activate genes without forming PRC2. This is an issue because it means the methylation activity of the enzyme is not mediated by complex formation. In breast cancer cells, EZH2 activates genes that promote cell proliferation and survival. It can also activate regulatory genes like c-myc and cyclin D1 by interacting with Wnt signaling factors. Importantly, the mutation of tyrosine 641 to phenylalanine in the active SET domain of EZH2 results in preference for H3K27 tri-methylation and has been linked to lymphoma.",

The HSP90AA1 gene however is not altered in a majority of tumors according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Currently bladder cancer is found to have the largest number of alterations followed by pancreatic cancer. This may not come as a surprise since overall Hsp90 expression levels are held at such a high level compared to most all other proteins within the cell., therefore further increasing Hsp90 levels may not provide any benefit to cancer growth. Additionally, whole genome sequencing across all tumor types and cancer cell lines reveals that there are presently 115 different mutations within the HSP90AA1 open reading frame. The effects of these mutations on HSP90A function, however, remain unknown. Remarkably, in a number of tumors the HSP90AA1 gene is homozygously deleted, suggesting that these tumors may have a reduced level of malignancy. This is supported by a comparative genome-wide analysis of 206 gastric cancer patients that reported loss of HSP90AA1 is indeed associated with favorable outcomes after surgery alone. This supports the possibility that the absence of Hsp90A in tumor biopsies may serve as a biomarker for positive clinical outcomes. Biologically, Hsp90A differs from Hsp90B in that Hsp90A is presently understood to function as a secreted extracellular agent in wound healing and inflammation in addition to its intracellular roles. These two processes are often hijacked by cancer allowing for malignant cell motility, metastasis and extravasion. Current research in prostate cancer indicates that extracellular Hsp90A transduces signals that promote the chronic inflammation of cancer-associated fibroblasts. This reprogramming of the extracellular milieu surrounding malignant adenocarcinoma cells is understood to stimulate prostate cancer progression. Extracellular HSP90A induces inflammation through the activation of the NF-\u03baB (RELA) and STAT3 transcription programs that include the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Coincidentally NF-\u03baB also induces expression Hsp90A., thus providing a model where newly expressed Hsp90A would also be secreted from the stimulated fibroblast thereby creating positive autocrine and paracrine feedback loops resulting in an inflammatory storm at the site of malignancy. This concept requires further attention as it may explain the correlation of increased levels of Hsp90A in the plasma of patients with advanced stages of malignancy.",

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect microorganisms by recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and IL-1R family members respond the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines.

The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut. The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux. The disease is diagnosed by biopsy done by an endoscope (a fiberoptic camera). Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating a healthy diet. Treatment is based on the cancer's stage and location, together with the person's general condition and individual preferences. Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with the hope of a cure. In most other cases, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, palliative care is often recommended. As of 2012, esophageal cancer was the eighth-most common cancer globally with 456,000 new cases during the year. It caused about 400,000 deaths that year, up from 345,000 in 1990. Rates vary widely among countries, with about half of all cases occurring in China. It is around three times more common in men than in women.

De-regulation of the autocrine Wnt signaling pathway via mutations in APC and Axin have been linked to activation of various types of human cancer. Genetic alterations that lead to de-regulation of the autocrine Wnt pathway result in transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other pathways, in turn contributing to proliferation of tumor cells. In colorectal cancer, for example, mutations in APC, axin, or \u03b2-catenin promote \u03b2-catenin stabilization and transcription of genes encoding cancer-associated proteins. Furthermore, in human breast cancer, interference with the de-regulated Wnt signaling pathway reduces proliferation and survival of cancer. These findings suggest that interference with Wnt signaling at the ligand-receptor level may improve the effectiveness of cancer therapies.",

Genome instability, i.e., the tendency of the genome to acquire mutations and epimutations, underlies human genetic disease, causally contributes to cancer and has also been implicated in aging and age-related, degenerative conditions other than cancer. Little is known about the mechanisms that give rise to spontaneous changes in the genome or epigenome and how this may lead, in somatic cells, to increased cancer risk and loss of organ and tissue function with age. We study genome and epigenome instability as a function of age in various model organisms, including mouse and fruit fly, and its consequences in terms of alterations in tissue-specific patterns of gene regulation. We developed transgenic reporter systems in mouse and fruit fly, which allow us to determine tissue-specific frequencies of various forms of genome instability, e.g., point mutations, deletions, translocations. By crossing the mutational reporter animals with mutants harboring specific defects in various genome maintenance pathways, the relevance of these pathways for the accumulation of specific forms of genome instability is assessed, in relation to the pathophysiology of aging. Similarly, by using knockdown approaches we assess the effect of specific genes implicated in longevity and healthy aging, e.g., SOD, FOXO, SIR2, on genome integrity. More recently, we have begun to assess global gene mutation and epimutation loads in normal and disease tissues of both animal models and humans using massively parallel sequencing approaches.",

The study of gray genetics has pointed to a molecular pathway that may lead to tumour development. Both STX17 and the neighboring NR4A3 gene are overexpressed in melanomas from gray horses, and those carrying a loss-of-function mutation in ASIP (agouti signaling protein) had a higher incidence of melanoma, implying that increased melanocortin-1 receptor signaling promotes melanoma development in Gray horses.",

The first was a chromosomal instability pathway thought to be responsible for the adenoma to carcinoma progression, which was characterized by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 5q, 17p and 18q. The second pathway was believed to be the microsatellite instability pathway, which is characterized by increases or decreases in the number of tandem repeats of simple DNA sequences. This type of instability is associated with some specific mutations, including genes involved with DNA mismatch repair and surprisingly, transforming growth factor-beta. More recently, those in the field of colorectal cancer have acknowledged that cancer formation is far more complex, but cancer related genes still tend to be categorized as chromosomal or microsatellite instability genes.",

A minimal level of intra-tumour heterogeneity is a simple consequence of the imperfection of DNA replication: whenever a cell (normal or cancerous) divides, a few mutations are acquired\u2014leading to a diverse population of cancer cells. The heterogeneity of cancer cells introduces significant challenges in designing effective treatment strategies. However, research into understanding and characterizing heterogeneity can allow for a better understanding of the causes and progression of disease.

Recently, a relatively high prevalence of PTPN11 mutations (24%) were detected by next-generation sequencing in a cohort of NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia patients, although the prognostic significance of such associations has not been clarified. These data suggests that Shp2 may be a proto-oncogene. However, it has been reported that PTPN11/Shp2 can act as either tumor promoter or suppressor. In aged mouse model, hepatocyte-specific deletion of PTPN11/Shp2 promotes inflammatory signaling through the STAT3 pathway and hepatic inflammation/necrosis, resulting in regenerative hyperplasia and spontaneous development of tumors. Decreased PTPN11/Shp2 expression was detected in a subfraction of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens.

Response to fungal or bacterial infection occurs through two distinct signalling cascades, one of which is toll pathway and the other is immune deficiency (IMD) pathway. The toll pathway is similar to mammalian TLR signalling, but unlike mammalian TLRs, toll is not activated directly by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Its receptor ectodomain recognizes cleaved form of the cytokine Sp\u00e4tzle, which is secreted in the haemolymph as inactive dimeric precursor. Toll receptor shares the cytoplasmatic TIR domain with mammalian TLRs, but ectodomain and intracytoplasmatic tail are different. This difference might reflect a function of these receptors as cytokine receptors rather than PRRs. Toll pathway is activated by different stimuli, such as Gram positive bacteria, fungi and virulence factors. First, the Sp\u00e4tzle processing enzyme (SPE) is activated in response to infection and cleaves Sp\u00e4tzle. Cleaved Sp\u00e4tzle then binds to toll receptor and crosslinks its ectodomains. This triggers conformational changes in receptor resulting in signalling through toll. Signalling now is very similar to mammalian signalling through TLRs. Toll-induced signalling complex (TICS) is formed, comprising MyD88, Tube and Pelle (the orthologue of mammalian IRAK). Signal from TICS is then transduced to Cactus (homologue of mammalian I\u03baB), phosphorylated Cactus is polyubiquitylated and degraded, allowing nuclear translocation of DIF (dorsal-related immunity facor; a homologue of mammalian NF-\u03baB) and induction of transcription of genes for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as Drosomycin.",

A study conducted by Modhiran et al. attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the TLR signaling pathway. TLRs are known to recognize extra and intra cellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and Type 1 IFN production was reduced when the ADE-DENV complexe bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of TLR production and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the TLRs transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the TLR signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.",

In addition, therapy-induced Hedgehog pathway activation has been shown to be necessary for progression of Prostate Cancer tumors after androgen deprivation therapy. This connection between the Hedgehog signaling pathway and human cancers may provide for the possible of therapeutic intervention as treatment for such cancers.

Colorectal cancer is a disease originating from the epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently as a result of mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway that increase signaling activity.

The most commonly mutated gene in all colorectal cancer is the \"APC\" gene, which produces the APC protein. The APC protein prevents the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin protein. Without APC, \u03b2-catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates (moves) into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates the transcription of proto-oncogenes. These genes are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation, but when inappropriately expressed at high levels, they can cause cancer. While APC is mutated in most colon cancers, some cancers have increased \u03b2-catenin because of mutations in \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) that block its own breakdown, or have mutations in other genes with function similar to APC such as AXIN1, AXIN2, TCF7L2, or NKD1.",
