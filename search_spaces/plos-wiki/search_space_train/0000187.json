Loss of cardiomyocytes because of injury or diseases leads to heart failure, which is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, regenerative potential of the adult heart is limited. The Hippo pathway is a recently identified signaling cascade that plays an evolutionarily conserved role in organ size control by inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, regulating fates of stem/progenitor cells, and in some circumstances, limiting cell size. Interestingly, research indicates a key role of this pathway in regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart size. Inactivation of the Hippo pathway or activation of its downstream effector, the Yes-associated protein transcription coactivator, improves cardiac regeneration. Several known upstream signals of the Hippo pathway such as mechanical stress, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, and oxidative stress are known to play critical roles in cardiac physiology. In addition, Yes-associated protein has been shown to regulate cardiomyocyte fate through multiple transcriptional mechanisms.",

Homeobox-containing genes play critical roles in regulating tissue-specific gene expression essential for tissue differentiation, as well as determining the temporal and spatial patterns of development (Shiojima et al., 1995). It has been demonstrated that a \"Drosophila\" homeobox-containing gene called 'tinman' is expressed in the developing dorsal vessel and in the equivalent of the vertebrate heart. Mutations in tinman result in loss of heart formation in the embryo, suggesting that tinman is essential for \"Drosophila\" heart formation. Furthermore, abundant expression of Csx, the presumptive mouse homolog of tinman, is observed only in the heart from the time of cardiac differentiation. CSX, the human homolog of murine Csx, has a homeodomain sequence identical to that of Csx and is expressed only in the heart, again suggesting that CSX plays an important role in human heart formation. In humans, proper NKX2-5 expression is essential for the development of atrial, ventricular, and conotruncal septation, atrioventricular (AV) valve formation, and maintenance of AV conduction. Mutations in expression are associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) and related ailments. Patients with NKX2-5 mutations commonly present AV conduction block and atrial septal defects (ASD). Recently, postnatal roles of cardiac transcription factors have been extensively investigated. Consistent with the direct transactivation of numerous cardiac genes reactivated in response to hypertrophic stimulation, cardiac transcription factors are profoundly involved in the generation of cardiac hypertrophy or in cardioprotection from cytotoxic stress in the adult heart. Nkx-2.5 transcription factor may help myocytes endure cytotoxic stress, however further exploration in this field is required.",

Furthermore, it has been shown that cell-cell adhesion formation not only restricts growth and proliferation by imposing physical constraints such as cell area, but also by triggering signaling pathways that downregulate proliferation. One such pathway is the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, which is largely responsible for inhibiting cell growth in mammals. This pathway consists primarily of a phosphorylation cascade involving serine kinases and is mediated by regulatory proteins, which regulate cell growth by binding to growth-controlling genes. The serine/threonine kinase Hippo (Mst1/Mst2 in mammals) activates a secondary kinase (Lats1/Lats2), which phosphorylates YAP, a transcriptional activator of growth genes. The phosphorylation of YAP serves to export it from the nucleus and prevent it from activating growth-promoting genes; this is how the Hippo-YAP pathway inhibits cell growth. More importantly, the Hippo-YAP pathway uses upstream elements to act in response to cell-cell contact and controls density-dependent inhibition of proliferation. For example, cadherins are transmembrane proteins that form cellular junctions via homophilic binding and thus act as detectors for cell-cell contact. Cadherin-mediated activation of the inhibitory pathway involves the transmembrane E-cadherin forming a homophilic bond in order to activate \u03b1- and \u03b2-catenin, which then stimulate downstream components of the Hippo-YAP pathway to ultimately downregulate cell growth. This is consistent with the finding that E-cadherin overexpression hinders metastasis and tumorigenesis. Because YAP is shown to be associated with mitogenic growth factor signaling and thus cell proliferation, it is likely that future studies will focus on the Hippo-YAP pathway's role in cancer cells.",

Many knockout mouse models with tendon phenotypes have helped in understanding which upstream factors or pathways affect Tnmd expression. Similarly, the generation of Tnmd knockout mouse model allowed the suggestion of possible downstream effectors. It is important to emphasize that most of the below studies show correlations between Tnmd expression or function to other genes and not a direct link in a common signalling cascade. Regarding upstream regulators of Tnmd expression the description of the scleraxis (Scx) knockout mouse line suggested that Scx can directly drive Tnmd transcription, because Scx deletion led to complete elimination of Tnmd expression. Overexpression of scleraxis in cultured tenocytes or in mesenchymal stem cells significantly upregulated Tnmd expression. The deletion of myostatin in mice resulted in a parallel decrease in Scx and Tnmd mRNA levels, while myostatin stimulation of fibroblasts led to their upregulation, suggesting myostatin as an upstream factor in the Tnmd pathway. Egr1/2 transcription factors can induce Scx and collagen I gene expression, hence it would be interesting to investigate if Egr1 or 2 also can affect Tnmd expression. The absence of the Mohawk (Mkx) gene led to significantly lower Tnmd expression as well as collagen I and fibromodulin. A significant loss of Tnmd was noticeable in Mkx knockouts at E16.5, while Scx expression was unchanged [22], suggesting that Mkx can also directly affect Tnmd expression. Activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in bone marrow-derived stem cells resulted in Tnmd upregulation. Scx and Mkx expression were unaffected, suggesting the Wnt/ \u03b2-catenin signalling works independent from these transcription factors. Regarding downstream factors, the Tnmd knockout mouse model suggested correlation to collagen I based on the observed abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis resulting in pathologically thicker fibres. The lower cellular density and proliferation in the mutant tendons, as well as the reduced self-renewal and earlier senescence of Tnmd-deficient tendon stem/progenitor cells was coupled with downregulation of the proliferative marker Cyclin D1 and upregulation of the senescent marker p53.

In its active state, Yki binds to the transcription factor Scalloped (Sd), and the Yki-Sd complex becomes localized to the nucleus. This allows for the expression of several genes that promote organ growth, such as \"cyclin E\", which promotes cell cycle progression, and \"diap1\" (\"Drosophila\" inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1), which, as its name suggests, prevents apoptosis. Yki also activates expression of the \"bantam\" microRNA, a positive growth regulator that specifically affects cell number. Thus, the inactivation of Yki by Wts inhibits growth through the transcriptional repression of these pro-growth regulators. By phosphorylating Yki at serine 168, Wts promotes the association of Yki with 14-3-3 proteins, which help to anchor Yki in the cytoplasm and prevent its transport to the nucleus.

The sequence identity between FAM homologs is higher than 90% when comparing the homologs of \"Xenopus\", zebrafish, mouse, and human, suggesting that this might also be conserved among other organisms. Indeed, knockout gene inactivation in mouse embryos showed that the function of ectodermin as inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling is conserved. Embryos lacking of ectodermin show defective development of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), which is the first tissue that is induced by TGF-beta signals in mouse embryos; in accordance with loss of an inhibitor, ectodermin-/- embryos showed enlarged AVE induction. As the AVE is a natural source of secreted TGF-beta antagonists, this primary AVE expansion caused secondarily, at later stages, an inhibition of extracellular TGF-beta ligands, resulting in embryos lacking of mesoderm development. This model was confirmed by the finding that ectodermin-/- embryos were rescued to wild type (normal AVE, normal mesoderm development) by lowering the genetic dosage of the main TGF-beta ligand of the emrbyo, Nodal. Further supporting a role as TGF-beta inhibitor, tissue-selective deletion of ectodermin from the epiblast (from which the mesoderm, but not the AVE, derive) left the AVE untouched but caused this time an expansion of anterior mesodermal fates, indicative of increased responsiveness to TGF-beta signals. Collectively, these data confirmed with genetic tools a cell-autonomous role for ectodermin as inhibitor of Smad4 responses previously identified in Xenopus embryos and human cell lines.",

Regarding the mechanistic role of beta-catenin in cardiac hypertrophy, transgenic mouse studies have shown somewhat conflicting results regarding whether upregulation of beta-catenin is beneficial or detrimental. A recent study using a conditional knockout mouse that either lacked beta-catenin altogether or expressed a non-degradable form of beta-catenin in cardiomyocytes reconciled a potential reason for these discrepancies. There appears to be strict control over the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in cardiac muscle. Mice lacking beta-catenin had no overt phenotype in the left ventricular myocardium; however, mice harboring a stabilized form of beta-catenin developed dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the temporal regulation of beta-catenin by protein degradation mechanisms is critical for normal functioning of beta-catenin in cardiac cells. In a mouse model harboring knockout of a desmosomal protein, plakoglobin, implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, the stabilization of beta-catenin was also enhanced, presumably to compensate for the loss of its plakogloblin homolog. These changes were coordinate with Akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 inhibition, suggesting once again that the abnormal stabilization of beta-catenin may be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy. Further studies employing a double knockout of plakoglobin and beta-catenin showed that the double knockout developed cardiomyopathy, fibrosis and arrhythmias resulting in sudden cardiac death. Intercalated disc architecture was severely impaired and connexin 43-resident gap junctions were markedly reduced. Electrocardiogram measurements captured spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmias in the double transgenic animals, suggesting that the two catenins\u2014beta-catenin and plakoglobin are critical and idispensible for mechanoelectrical coupling in cardiomyocytes.",

At times, loss of activity during development may mask the role of the gene in the adult state, especially if the gene is involved in numerous processes spanning development. Conditional/inducible mutation approaches are then required that first allow the mouse to develop and mature normally prior to ablation of the gene of interest.",

HB-EGF binding and activation of EGF receptors plays a critical role during cardiac valve tissue development and the maintenance of normal heart function in adults. During valve tissue development the interaction of HB-EGF with EGF receptors and heparan sulfate proteogylcans is essential for the prevention of malformation of valves due to enlargement. In the vascular system areas of disturbed flow show upregulation of HB-EGF with promotion of vascular lesions, atherogenesis, and hyperplasia of intimal tissue in vessels. The flow disturbance remodeling of the vascular tissues due to HB-EGF expression contributes to aortic valve disease, peripheral vascular disease, and conduit stenosis.",

Depletion of USP9X from two-cell mouse embryos halts blastocyst development and results in slower blastomere cleavage rate, impaired cell adhesion and a loss of cell polarity. It has also been implicated that USP9X is likely to influence developmental processes through signaling pathways of Notch, Wnt, EGF, and mTOR. USP9X has been recognized in studies of mouse and human stem cells involving embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells. High expression is retained in undifferentiated progenitor and stem cells and decreases as differentiation continues. USP9X is a protein-coding gene that has been implicated either directly through mutations or indirectly in a number of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Three mutations have been connected with X-linked intellectual disability and disrupt neuronal growth and cell migration. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s disease, have also been linked to USP9X. Specifically, USP9X has been implicated in the regulation of the phosphorylation and expression of the microtule-associated protein tau, which forms pathological aggregates in Alzheimer\u2019s and other tauopathies. Scientists have generated a knockout model where they isolated hippocampal neurons from an USP9X-knockout male mouse, which showed a 43% reduction in axonal length and aborization compared to wildtype.",

Together with paracingulin, cingulin also was reported to regulate claudin-2 expression through RhoA-dependent and independent mechanisms. The role of cingulin in development has been studied by morpholino. oligonucleotide-mediated depletion in chicken, indicating that cingulin is involved in neural crest development. In early mouse and frog embryos, maternal cingulin is localized in the cell cortex. Through early mouse development, cytocortical cingulin in present from oogenesis (cumulus-oocyte contact sites) until 16-cells morulae stage (apical microvillous zones) during early embryogenesis; then maternal cingulin is degraded by endocytic turn-over from the 32-cells stage. Regarding the zygotic cingulin, it accumulates at the tight junctions from 16-cells stage, 10 hours after ZO-1 assembly. Furthermore, the synthesis of cingulin in early mouse embryos is tissue-specific and it occurs in blastocyst (up-regulated in trophectoderm and down-regulated in inner-cells). In \"Xenopus\" \"laevis\" embryos, maternal cingulin is recruited to apical cell-cell junctions from 2-cells stage.",
