One of the best studied natural pathogens of \"C. elegans\" is the microsporidium \"Nematocida parisii\", which was directly isolated from wild-caught \"C. elegans\". \"N. parisii\" is an intracellular parasite that is exclusively transmitted horizontally from one animal to another. The microsporidian spores are likely to exit the cells by disrupting a conserved cytoskeletal structure in the intestine called the terminal web. It seems that none of the known immune pathways of \"C. elegans\" is involved in mediating resistance against \"N. parisii\". Microsporidia were found in several nematodes isolated from different locations, indicating that microsporidia are common natural parasites of \"C. elegans\". The \"N. parisii\"-\"C. elegans\" system represents a very useful tool to study infection mechanisms of intracellular parasites. Additionally, a new species of microsporidia was recently found in a wild caught \"C. elegans\" that genome sequencing places in the same genus \"Nematocida\" as prior microsporidia seen in these nematodes. This new species was named \"Nematocida displodere,\" after a phenotype seen in late infected worms that explode at the vulva to release infectious spores. \"N. displodere\" was shown to infect a broad range of tissues and cell types in \"C. elegans\", including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, seam cells, and coelomocytes.

Another eukaryotic pathogen is the fungus \"Drechmeria coniospora\", which has not been directly co-isolated with \"C. elegans\" from nature, but is still considered to be a natural pathogen of \"C. elegans\". \"D. coniospora\" attaches to the cuticle of the worm at the vulva, mouth, and anus and its hyphae penetrate the cuticle.

            "document": "Pathogenesis-related protein . Although the term pathogenesis-related proteins by itself may give the impression that (all) proteins common to pathological processes in a given plant species can be considered PRs, proteins that are constitutively present in low, yet readily detectable amounts, but which are increased substantially by pathogen infection, such as oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes or general enzymes of aromatic biosynthesis, have been excluded. However, if specific isoforms of such enzymes do not normally occur but are induced as a result of infection, such isoenzymes do belong to the PRs. The major criterion for inclusion among the PRs is that the protein concerned is newly expressed upon infection, although not necessarily in all pathological conditions. These considerations imply that the characteristics of the induction of PRs take priority over other identifying characteristics, such as chemical properties and cellular localization.18 Proteins that are induced exclusively during disease development in compatible host\u2013pathogen combinations have hardly been considered as PRs. Rather, the \u201cclassical\u201d PRs are a collective set of novel proteins associated with host defense mainly in incompatible interactions and, thus, are related primarily to a special type of pathogenesis, i.e., one culminating in the impediment of further pathogen progress. In compatible host\u2013pathogen interactions, pathogenesis, symptom expression, and reduction of growth are generally more severe, and enzyme activities may be increased to high levels, but novel host proteins have been observed only occasionally and remain poorly characterized. Proteins expressed under such conditions seem to be rather specific, being induced under the influence of particular pathogens but not others. This situation contrasts with the massive, apparently coordinated, induction of a common set of PRs in virtually any incompatible interaction, which in some cases can amount to 10% of the total soluble protein of the leaf. For this reason, PRs have been implicated in the resistance response and, more specifically, in the acquired resistance that is induced accompanying necrotic lesion formation in various plant species. When plants are locally infected with a pathogen inducing hypersensitive necrosis, they acquire systemically enhanced resistance to subsequent infection by various types of pathogens, and this systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is associated with the induction of PRs in tissues distant from the original inoculation site.1,7,8,19 Such observations suggested that PRs are defense proteins functioning in limiting pathogen multiplication and/or spread. Among the many metabolic alterations characteristic of a hypersensitive response, induction of PRs is a relatively late event,14 and their contribution to resistance against the initial infection is likely to be limited. In contrast, PRs induced in noninfected, distant leaves as a result of primary infection might afford an enhanced level of protection, resulting in reduced size or number of lesions, or even in reduced systemic symptom severity, upon further infection. The \u201crelated situations\u201d in which PRs were found to be induced, seem to prove the point: application of chemicals that mimic the effect of pathogen infection or induce some aspects of the host response, as well as wound responses that give rise to proteins that are also induced during infections, can induce both PRs and acquired resistance. This is the case for salicylic acid, for example, which has since been shown to be an essential intermediate in the signal\u2013transduction pathway leading to the induction of PRs in tobacco.",

Antigenic variation refers to the mechanism by which an infectious agent such as a protozoan, bacterium or virus alters its surface proteins in order to evade a host immune response. It is related to phase variation. Immune evasion is particularly important for organisms that target long-lived hosts, repeatedly infect a single host and are easily transmittable. Antigenic variation not only enables immune evasion by the pathogen, but also allows the microbes to cause re-infection, as their antigens are no longer recognized by the host's immune system. When an organism is exposed to a particular antigen (i.e. a protein on the surface of a bacterium) an immune response is stimulated and antibodies are generated to target that specific antigen. The immune system will then \"remember\" that particular antigen, and defenses aimed at that antigen become part of the immune system\u2019s acquired immune response. If the same pathogen tries to re-infect the same host the antibodies will act rapidly to target the pathogen for destruction. However, if the pathogen can alter its surface antigens, it can evade the host's acquired immune system. This will allow the pathogen to re-infect the host while the immune system generates new antibodies to target the newly identified antigen. Antigenic variation can occur by altering a variety of surface molecules including proteins and carbohydrates. There are many molecular mechanisms behind antigenic variation, including gene conversion, site-specific DNA inversions, hypermutation, as well as recombination of sequence cassettes. In all cases, antigenic variation and phase variation result in a heterogenic phenotype of a clonal population. Individual cells either express the phase-variable protein(s) or express one of multiple antigenic forms of the protein. This form of regulation has been identified mainly, but not exclusively, for a wide variety of surface structures in pathogens and is implicated as a virulence strategy.",

Microsporidia are known to produce xenomas in oligochaetes, insects, crustaceans and fish.

For example, \"Microsporidium chaetogastris\" infects solely connective and muscle tissue cells of the annelid \"Chaetogaster diaphanus\", whereas other species of microsporidia will target other tissue types. Another example is microsporidial gill disease in different species of fish caused by \"Loma salmonae\".

Once a host cell is infected with the microsporidian (or protist) parasite, a complete restructuring of the host cell ensues. This occurs as the parasite seeks to take control of the metabolism of the cell, in order to survive and exploit the host cell's resources and reproduction. It provides the parasite with optimal growth conditions and protection from the host's immune response. The parasite proliferates within the host cell where its mass replaces most of the host cell's cytoplasm, with the rest being taken up by microvillus structures and rhizoids. Other structures may be present inside the infected host cell including vesicles, fat globules and bundles of fibril. The nucleus may be in varying locations including the centre of the cell and may also vary in structure i.e. lobed, branched or divided into multiple fragments, but it will always be hypertrophic.

Some commensal organisms, or organisms that occur in the body naturally and benefit from living in the host without causing it harm or conferring any significant benefit, also have the potential to become pathogens. This specific type of commensal/pathogen hybrid is called an opportunistic pathogen. Not all commensals are opportunistic pathogens. However, opportunistic pathogens are commensals by nature. They are not harmful for the body when the body's immune system is functioning normally, but if the host immune system becomes compromised, or loses its ability to function at its full or near-full potential, opportunistic pathogens switch from being a commensal organism to a pathogen. This is where the name opportunistic pathogen comes from: they are only pathogens when the opportunity to infect the host is there. An example of an opportunistic pathogen is Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a type of fungus/yeast found in the intestines and mucous membranes (like the vagina and throat) of healthy humans. It is also found on the skin of healthy humans. In healthy humans- meaning humans with functioning immune systems- Candida will not cause infections. It will simply co-exist with the host. However, if a person is in chemo therapy or has HIV/AIDS, which weakens the immune system (thus compromising it), Candida albicans will cause infections. It can cause infections as innocuous as yeast infections or thrush and it can cause infections as serious as systemic candidiasis which is fatal in about 50% of cases. Though the mechanisms Candida albicans uses to switch from being a commensal to a pathogen are largely unknown, the reasons for its strength as a pathogen are broadly known. Candida has plenty of phenotypic and genotypic plasticity which means it generates change quickly. As a result of constant diversification, candida has many opportunities to make advantageous mutations. Additionally, Candida can change morphology. It can convert from the yeast for to the filamentous form and vice versa, depending on which stage of infection it is in. In the beginning stages of infection, Candida is more likely to be in the filamentous form because this allows it to adhere to and infect cells more efficiently. Other adaptations of the commensal pathogen include the ability to grow at host temperature, create biofilms, resist reactive oxygen species (ROS) created as part of the human immune response to fight off infection, adapt to different pHs (relevant for being carried in the blood in different parts of the body) and adapt to low nutrient or low glucose environments like the liver Because Candida albicans is very good at adapting to the fluctuating environments of the humans body (i.e. its changing temperature, pH, oxygen reactivity and more) candida albicans is a good pathogen.",

Although susceptible plants can increase callose and lignin deposits in response to infection, the hypersensitive response is only found in resistant varieties.

A potential secondary metabolite with phytotoxic properties within the \"Sphaceloma genus\" is the variety of pigments called elsinochromes. These are red/orange pigments produced by many \"Elsino\u00eb\" and \"Sphaceloma\" species. The \"Sphaceloma\" genus is the anamorph analog of the \"Elsino\u00eb\" genus of which the pigments are named so it is reasonable to presume \"S. perseae\" also produces this phytotoxic pigments. Elsinochromes were proven to kill cells of the host plant and even cause necrotic legions on live tissue by reactions of a singlet oxygen species from the pigment. The singlet oxygen breaks down proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids in the plant cells. Toxicity has been demonstrated to decrease in the addition of singlet oxygen quenchers, as they prevent the interaction of the oxygen species with plant cells.",

In this stage, an oogonium is fertilized by an antheridium. \"Pythium voultum\" is usually fertilized by one antheridium, but has been observed being fertilized by as many as four antheridia at a time, which is different from other \"Pythia spp.\" After fertilization, an oospore is produced. Oospores are resting structures that allow the pathogen to overwinter in the soil. Once the oospore is formed, the oospore will either begin to produce zoospores or begin to germinate and directly infect new plants itself. Because of this fact, the initial inoculum can be either considered the oospore itself or the zoospores that emerge from the oospore. Dissemination of these spores is reliant on water. Zoospores specifically use water to swim to the host. Once the infectious spores reach the host\u2019s root tissue, infection occurs. This infection is a systemic infection resulting in chlorosis, wilting, and ultimately plant death. Before plant death occurs, the infected plants produce structures called sporangia. Sporangia can then be disseminated by the wind, rain, or mechanical factors to reach new hosts. Once the sporangia reach a new, uninfected host, zoospores are released. These zoospores produced by the sporangia again use water and moisture to swim to openings or wounds in the bentgrass. This is different from the initial inoculum because these spores may enter through other plant structures than the root tissue. From this point, the infected plant will eventually die and the pathogen will again overwinter in the oospore structures. Infection of grass occurs in fall and spring. This is when soil temperatures and moisture levels are optimal for spores to infect the roots of plants.",

Although the term pathogenesis-related proteins by itself may give the impression that (all) proteins common to pathological processes in a given plant species can be considered PRs, proteins that are constitutively present in low, yet readily detectable amounts, but which are increased substantially by pathogen infection, such as oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes or general enzymes of aromatic biosynthesis, have been excluded. However, if specific isoforms of such enzymes do not normally occur but are induced as a result of infection, such isoenzymes do belong to the PRs. The major criterion for inclusion among the PRs is that the protein concerned is newly expressed upon infection, although not necessarily in all pathological conditions. These considerations imply that the characteristics of the induction of PRs take priority over other identifying characteristics, such as chemical properties and cellular localization.18 Proteins that are induced exclusively during disease development in compatible host\u2013pathogen combinations have hardly been considered as PRs. Rather, the \u201cclassical\u201d PRs are a collective set of novel proteins associated with host defense mainly in incompatible interactions and, thus, are related primarily to a special type of pathogenesis, i.e., one culminating in the impediment of further pathogen progress. In compatible host\u2013pathogen interactions, pathogenesis, symptom expression, and reduction of growth are generally more severe, and enzyme activities may be increased to high levels, but novel host proteins have been observed only occasionally and remain poorly characterized. Proteins expressed under such conditions seem to be rather specific, being induced under the influence of particular pathogens but not others. This situation contrasts with the massive, apparently coordinated, induction of a common set of PRs in virtually any incompatible interaction, which in some cases can amount to 10% of the total soluble protein of the leaf. For this reason, PRs have been implicated in the resistance response and, more specifically, in the acquired resistance that is induced accompanying necrotic lesion formation in various plant species. When plants are locally infected with a pathogen inducing hypersensitive necrosis, they acquire systemically enhanced resistance to subsequent infection by various types of pathogens, and this systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is associated with the induction of PRs in tissues distant from the original inoculation site.1,7,8,19 Such observations suggested that PRs are defense proteins functioning in limiting pathogen multiplication and/or spread. Among the many metabolic alterations characteristic of a hypersensitive response, induction of PRs is a relatively late event,14 and their contribution to resistance against the initial infection is likely to be limited. In contrast, PRs induced in noninfected, distant leaves as a result of primary infection might afford an enhanced level of protection, resulting in reduced size or number of lesions, or even in reduced systemic symptom severity, upon further infection. The \u201crelated situations\u201d in which PRs were found to be induced, seem to prove the point: application of chemicals that mimic the effect of pathogen infection or induce some aspects of the host response, as well as wound responses that give rise to proteins that are also induced during infections, can induce both PRs and acquired resistance. This is the case for salicylic acid, for example, which has since been shown to be an essential intermediate in the signal\u2013transduction pathway leading to the induction of PRs in tobacco.",

These viral inclusion bodies act as the centres of viral replication. The membrane glycoproteins NS3 and NS3a are expressed in large amounts in insect cells but not in mammalian cells.

They reduce their \u201ccore\u201d metabolic repertoire, making them more dependant on their host and environment. Their genome reduction occurs by different evolutionary mechanisms than those of streamlined free-living organisms. Pathogenic organisms are thought to undergo genome reduction due to genetic drift, rather than purifying selection. Genetic drift is caused by small and effective populations within a microbial community, rather than large and dominating populations. In this case, DNA mutations happen by chance, and thus often lead to maladaptive genome degradation and lower overall fitness. Rather than loosing non-coding DNA regions or extraneous genes to increase fitness during replication, they loose certain \"core\" metabolic genes that may now be supplemented by their host, symbiont, or environment. Since their genome reduction is less dependent on fitness, pseudogenes are frequent in these organisms. They also typically undergo low rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Viral genomes resemble prokaryotic genomes in that they have very few non-coding regions. They are, however, significantly smaller than prokaryotic genomes. While viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, viral genomes are considered streamlined due to the strong purifying selection that occurs when the virus has successfully infected a host. During the initial phase of an infection, there is a large bottleneck for the virus population which allows for more genetic diversity, but due to the rapid replication of these viruses, the population size is restored quickly and the diversity within the population is reduced.",

When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. \"Agrobacterium\" performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA into the plant's genome. See above for more details about the process of plasmid DNA insertion into the host genome. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes this tissue to become crushed and/or distorted. The crushed vessels lead to reduced water flow in the xylem. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant. Crown gall disease caused by \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" can be controlled by using various different methods. The best way to control this disease is to take preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools so as to avoid infecting new plants. Performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields are also valuable practices. Avoiding wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation is important for preventing disease. In horticultural techniques in which multiple plants are joined together to grow as one, such as budding and grafting these techniques lead to plant wounds. Wounds are the primary location of bacterial entry into the host plant. Therefore, it is advisable to perform these techniques during times of the year when \"Agrobacteria\" are not active. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection, since these insects cause wounds (aka bacterial entryways) in the plant roots. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.",

Parasites are generally introduced into a vertebrate host by the bite of an insect host (generally a mosquito, with the exception of some \"Plasmodium\" species of reptiles). Parasites first infect the liver or other tissue, where they undergo a single large round of replication before exiting the host cell to infect erythrocytes. At this point, some species of \"Plasmodium\" of primates can form a long-lived dormant stage called a hypnozoite. It can remain in the liver for more than a year. However, for most \"Plasmodium\" species, the parasites in infected liver cells are only what are called merozoites. After emerging from the liver, they enter red blood cells, as explained above. They then go through continuous cycles of erythrocyte infection, while a small percentage of parasites differentiate into a sexual stage called a gametocyte which is picked up by an insect host taking a blood meal. In some hosts, invasion of erythrocytes by \"Plasmodium\" species can result in disease, called malaria. This can sometimes be severe, rapidly followed by death of the host (e.g. \"P. falciparum\" in humans). In other hosts, \"Plasmodium\" infection can apparently be asymptomatic.",

Alphaherpesviruses alone can cause the host to have mild symptoms, but these viruses can be associated with severe disease when they are transferred to a new species. Humans can even pass and also get an HSV-1 infection from other primate species. However, because of evolutionary differences between primate species, only some species can pass HSV-1 in an interspecies interaction. Also, though HSV-1 transmission from humans to other species primates can occur, there is no known sustained transmission chains that have resulted from constant transmission. A study found that Nbs1 is the most diverged in DNA sequence in the MRN complex between different primate species and that there is a high degree of species specificity, causing variability in promotion of the HSV-1 life cycle. The same study found that Nbs1 interacts with HSV-1's ICP0 proteins in an area of structural disorder of the nibrin. This suggests that in general, viruses commonly interact in intrinsically disordered domains in host proteins. It is possible that there are differences in the mammalian genomes that create unique environments for the viruses. Host proteins that are specific to the species might determine how the viruses must adapt to be able to ignite an infection in a new species. The evolution of increased disorder in nibrin benefits the host in decreasing ICP0 interaction and virus hijack. Nbs1 may not be the only host protein that evolves this way.",

In a paper by Baumler et al 1998, characters of Salmonella, such as its ability to cause intestinal infection were attributed to virulence factors like its ability to invade intestinal epithelial cells, induce neutrophil recruitment and interfere with the secretion of intestinal fluid. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that many strains or lineages of Salmonella exist, which is advantageous for the pathogen because its genetic diversity can acts as fodder for natural selection to tinder with. For instance, if a particular Salmonella strain is more fit in the host stomach environment, compared to other Salmonella strains, then the former will be positively selected for and increase in prevalence. Eventually this strain will colonize and infect the stomach. The other less fit strains will be selected against and will thus not persist. Another major host adaptation on the part of Salmonella was its adaptation to host blood temperatures. Because Salmonella can thrive at the human host temperature, 98.6 degrees F, it is fit for the host environment and hence survive well in it.

Some commensal organisms, or organisms that occur in the body naturally and benefit from living in the host without causing it harm or conferring any significant benefit, also have the potential to become pathogens. This specific type of commensal/pathogen hybrid is called an opportunistic pathogen. Not all commensals are opportunistic pathogens. However, opportunistic pathogens are commensals by nature. They are not harmful for the body when the body's immune system is functioning normally, but if the host immune system becomes compromised, or loses its ability to function at its full or near-full potential, opportunistic pathogens switch from being a commensal organism to a pathogen. This is where the name opportunistic pathogen comes from: they are only pathogens when the opportunity to infect the host is there. An example of an opportunistic pathogen is Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a type of fungus/yeast found in the intestines and mucous membranes (like the vagina and throat) of healthy humans. It is also found on the skin of healthy humans. In healthy humans- meaning humans with functioning immune systems- Candida will not cause infections. It will simply co-exist with the host. However, if a person is in chemo therapy or has HIV/AIDS, which weakens the immune system (thus compromising it), Candida albicans will cause infections. It can cause infections as innocuous as yeast infections or thrush and it can cause infections as serious as systemic candidiasis which is fatal in about 50% of cases. Though the mechanisms Candida albicans uses to switch from being a commensal to a pathogen are largely unknown, the reasons for its strength as a pathogen are broadly known. Candida has plenty of phenotypic and genotypic plasticity which means it generates change quickly. As a result of constant diversification, candida has many opportunities to make advantageous mutations. Additionally, Candida can change morphology. It can convert from the yeast for to the filamentous form and vice versa, depending on which stage of infection it is in. In the beginning stages of infection, Candida is more likely to be in the filamentous form because this allows it to adhere to and infect cells more efficiently. Other adaptations of the commensal pathogen include the ability to grow at host temperature, create biofilms, resist reactive oxygen species (ROS) created as part of the human immune response to fight off infection, adapt to different pHs (relevant for being carried in the blood in different parts of the body) and adapt to low nutrient or low glucose environments like the liver Because Candida albicans is very good at adapting to the fluctuating environments of the humans body (i.e. its changing temperature, pH, oxygen reactivity and more) candida albicans is a good pathogen.",

Viruses are parasitic in nature and cannot proliferate on their own. Therefore, they must infect another organism and effectively hijack cellular machinery to complete their life cycle. The first stage of the viral life cycle is called viral entry. This defines the manner in which a virus infects a new host cell. In nature, neurotropic viruses are usually transmitted through bites or scratches, as in the case of Rabies virus or certain strains of Herpesviruses. In tracing studies, this step occurs artificially, typically through the use of a syringe. The next stage of the viral life cycle is called viral replication. During this stage, the virus takes over the host cell's machinery to cause the cell to create more viral proteins and assemble more viruses. Once the cell has produced a sufficient number of viruses, the virus enters the viral shedding stage. During this stage, viruses leave the original host cell in search of a new host. In the case of neurotropic viruses, this transmission typically occurs at the synapse. Viruses can jump across the relatively short space from one neuron to the next. This trait is what makes viruses so useful in tracer studies. Once the virus enters the next cell, the cycle begins anew. The original host cell begins to degrade after the shedding stage. In tracer studies, this is the reason the timing must be tightly controlled. If the virus is allowed to spread too far, the original microcircuitry of interest is degraded and no useful information can be retrieved. Typically, viruses can infect only a small number of organisms, and even then only a specific cell type within the body. The specificity of a particular virus for a specific tissue is known as its tropism. Viruses in tracer studies are all neurotropic (capable of infecting neurons).",

In more complex mammalian species, immune systems, which include pathogen specific immune responses, target serovars of \"Salmonella\" through binding of antibodies to structures like flagella. Through the loss of the genetic material that codes for a flagellum to form, \"Salmonella\" can evade a host's immune system. \"mgtC\" leader RNA from bacteria virulence gene (mgtCBR operon) decreases flagellin production during infection by directly base pairing with mRNAs of the \"fljB\" gene encoding flagellin and promotes degradation. In the study by Kisela \"et al.\", more pathogenic serovars of \"S. enterica\" were found to have certain adhesins in common that have developed out of convergent evolution. This means that, as these strains of \"Salmonella\" have been exposed to similar conditions such as immune systems, similar structures evolved separately to negate these similar, more advanced defenses in hosts. There are still many questions about the way that \"Salmonella\" has evolved into so many different types but it has been suggested that \"Salmonella\" evolved through several phases.

(2002) demonstrated that the early development of \"Plasmopara viticola\" is regulated specifically and coordinately by unknown factors originating from the host grapevine plant \"Vitis vinifera\". The host factors influence the pathogen development in three ways: (i) accelerating the release of zoospores from mature sporangia, (ii) coordinating the morphogenesis of the germ tube through the reorientation of the polarity of the zoospores during the attachment to the host cell, and (iii) targeting the zoospores to the stomata by active chemotaxis from the open substomatal cavity. The expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes by the host plant \"V.vinifera\" during the infection of \"P.viticola\" has been investigated over the years. The expressions of PR-2, PR-3 and PR-4 genes are induced in the grapevine host during pathogen infection, which encode for cell wall-degrading enzymes B-1,3-glucanase (PR-2) and chitinases (PR-3 and PR-4). It was previously understood that oomycetes differ from true fungi by the presence of cellulose in the oomycetes\u2019 cell walls as opposed to chitin in true fungi. However, it was found that chitin synthesis is regulated during in planta growth and asexual propagation of \"P.viticola\" and this is further demonstrated by the presence of chitin on the cell walls of the hyphae, sporangiophores and sporangia of the grape downy mildew pathogen. Hence, both the cell wall-degrading enzymes are synthesized by the host grapevine plant specifically to target and degrade the cell walls of the oomycete pathogen. In addition, the upregulation of the PR-9 gene that encodes for peroxidase, which is a reactive oxygen species is associated with the systemic acquired defense of the grapevine host. The roles of other constitutively expressed PR genes during \"P.viticola\" infection such as PR-5, PR-1 and PR-10 genes remain ambiguous. PR-5 is involved in the synthesis of thaumatin-like proteins and osmotins, which are believed to inhibit the spore germination and germ tube growth of \"Plasmopara viticola\" by creating transmembrane pores.",

Replication of FV3 occurs between 12 and 32 degrees Celsius. Ranaviruses enter the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Viral particles are uncoated and subsequently move into the cell nucleus, where viral DNA replication begins via a virally encoded DNA polymerase.
