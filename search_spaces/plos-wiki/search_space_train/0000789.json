            "document": "Antimicrobial peptides . Bacteria use various resistance strategies to avoid antimicrobial peptide killing. Some microorganisms alter net surface charges. \"Staphylococcus aureus\" transports D-alanine from the cytoplasm to the surface teichoic acid which reduces the net negative charge by introducing basic amino groups. \"S. aureus\" also modifies its anionic membranes via MprF with L-lysine, increasing the positive net charge. The interaction of antimicrobial peptides with membrane targets can be limited by capsule polysaccharide of \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\".  Alterations occur in Lipid A. \"Salmonella\" species reduce the fluidity of their outer membrane by increasing hydrophobic interactions between an increased number of Lipid A acyl tails by adding myristate to Lipid A with 2-hydroxymyristate and forming hepta-acylated Lipid A by adding palmitate. The increased hydrophobic moment is thought to retard or abolish antimicrobial peptide insertion and pore formation. The residues undergo alteration in membrane proteins. In some Gram-negative bacteria, alteration in the production of outer membrane proteins correlates with resistance to killing by antimicrobial peptides. Non-typeable \"Hemophilus influenzae\" transports AMPs into the interior of the cell, where they are degraded. Furthermore, \"H. influenzae\" remodels its membranes to make it appear as if the bacterium has already been successfully attacked by AMPs, protecting it from being attacked by more AMPs. ATP-binding cassette transporters import antimicrobial peptides and the resistance-nodulation cell-division efflux pump exports antimicrobial peptides. Both transporters have been associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance. Bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes, which may degrade antimicrobial peptides leading to their resistance. Outer membrane vesicles produced by Gram-negative bacteria bind the antimicrobial peptides and sequester them away from the cells, thereby protecting the cells. The outer membrane vesicles are also known to contain various proteases, peptidases and other lytic enzymes, which may have a role in degrading the extracellular peptide and nucleic acid molecules, which if allowed to reach to the bacterial cells may be dangerous for the cells. Cyclic-di-GMP signaling had also been involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide resistance in \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\"",

Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills \"E. coli\" and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane is a frequent target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, such as in the antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by \u2018barrel-stave\u2019, \u2018carpet\u2019 or \u2018toroidal-pore\u2019 mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic. In general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.",

The host defense antimicrobial peptide protegrin I (PG-1), exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and good activity against multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens, with a mechanism consistent with membrane disruption via pore formation. However, PG-1 exhibits unfavorable drug properties and also exhibits significant hemolysis and, as such, has limited clinical use. PG-1 contains 18 amino acids and is ordered into an anti-parallel \u03b2-strand by two disulfide bridges. A fully synthetic cyclic peptide-like molecule containing a D-proline\u2013L-proline template grafted into a peptidomimetic scaffold to simulate and stabilize the beta hairpin conformation exhibited by PG-1 was used to generate a diverse library of peptidomimetic macrocycles which were screened for antibacterial activity. Variants in this 14-residue protein epitope mimetic (PEM) library such as the peptidomimetic L8-1 had an antimicrobial activity like that of PG-1 but with reduced hemolytic activity on human red blood cells. Iterative rounds of synthesis generated analogues with an increasingly potent and selective profile producing nanomolar range compounds specifically against Pseudomonas spp. at the expense of broad-spectrum activity. Final optimization led to the discovery of murepavadin, with remarkable Pseudomonas-specific activity \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" that has high plasma stability across species and is non-hemolytic at 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL.

Murepavadin functions through a novel mechanism of action by binding to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transport protein D (LptD), an outer membrane protein involved in lipopolysaccharide biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria. By binding to LptD, murepavadin inhibit the LPS transport function of LptD and causes lipopolysaccharide alterations in the outer membrane of the bacterium and, ultimately, cell death.",

The oral ingestion of live bacterial cell colonies has been proposed and is currently in therapy for the modulation of intestinal microflora, prevention of diarrheal diseases, treatment of \"H.

The proposed mechanism of action is not fully understood but is believed to have two main effects. The first is the nutritional effect, in which the bacteria compete with toxin producing bacteria. The second is the sanitary effect, which stimulates resistance to colonization and stimulates immune response. The oral delivery of bacterial cultures is often a problem because they are targeted by the immune system and often destroyed when taken orally. Artificial cells help address these issues by providing mimicry into the body and selective or long term release thus increasing the viability of bacteria reaching the gastrointestinal system. In addition, live bacterial cell encapsulation can be engineered to allow diffusion of small molecules including peptides into the body for therapeutic purposes. Membranes that have proven successful for bacterial delivery include cellulose acetate and variants of alginate. Additional uses that have arosen from encapsulation of bacterial cells include protection against challenge from \"M. Tuberculosis\" and upregulation of Ig secreting cells from the immune system. The technology is limited by the risk of systemic infections, adverse metabolic activities and the risk of gene transfer. However, the greater challenge remains the delivery of sufficient viable bacteria to the site of interest.",

It is in the membrane where a lipid carrier called bactoprenol carries peptidoglycan precursors through the cell membrane. Bactoprenol will attack the UDP-MurNAc penta, creating a PP-MurNac penta, which is now a lipid. UDP-GlcNAc is then transported to MurNAc, creating Lipid-PP-MurNAc penta-GlcNAc, a disaccharide, also a precursor to peptidoglycan. How this molecule is transported through the membrane is still not understood. However, once it is there, it is added to the growing glycan chain. The next reaction is known as tranglycosylation. In the reaction, the hydroxyl group of the GlcNAc will attach to the MurNAc in the glycan, which will displace the lipid-PP from the glycan chain. The enzyme responsible for this is transglycosylase. Some antibacterial drugs such as penicillin interfere with the production of peptidoglycan by binding to bacterial enzymes known as penicillin-binding proteins or DD-transpeptidases. Penicillin-binding proteins form the bonds between oligopeptide crosslinks in peptidoglycan.

These transporters may function together with auxiliary proteins that allow passage across just the cytoplasmic membrane or both membranes of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope.

Biochemical signals trafficked by OMVs may vary largely during 'war and peace' situations. In 'complacent' bacterial colonies, OMVs may be used to carry DNA to 'related' microbes for genetic transformations, and also translocate cell signaling molecules for quorum sensing and biofilm formation.

K is important for the generation of PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) recognition, which is involved in the innate immune system for living cells. PAMPs are the main molecules that run the innate immune system. They consist of either glycans or gylcoconjugates, and they pair with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to initiate an immune response.They send signals to the host cells to show there is a pathogen present. One of the best PRR is FLS2; it binds to flg22 (flagellin), and after just minutes, signaling responses such as kinase cascades, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and extracellular alkalization are stimulated. During PAMPs, ion transport across the plasma membrane is important. One particular important ion is K. The loss of K promotes the activation of PAMPs. The loss of anions help the growth of bacteria and the PAMPs system works to fight against foreign pathogens such as bacteria. PRRs recognize PAMPs when there is an infection within the cell. During extreme limitations to K, HAK5 is the only transporter. When PAMPs are triggered a large number of K are introduced to the cell, which signals a downstream immune response. In animal cells the toll-like receptor TLR4 binds the bacterial PAMP LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and induces K+ efflux through the MaxiK K+ channel, activating signal cascades and release of the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 HAK5 works alongside other kinase's to help with the immune response within a cell.

ILK1 has also been shown to phosphorylate the N-terminal of HAK5, which contributes to plant growth.

If the same pathogen tries to re-infect the same host the antibodies will act rapidly to target the pathogen for destruction. However, if the pathogen can alter its surface antigens, it can evade the host's acquired immune system. This will allow the pathogen to re-infect the host while the immune system generates new antibodies to target the newly identified antigen. Antigenic variation can occur by altering a variety of surface molecules including proteins and carbohydrates. There are many molecular mechanisms behind antigenic variation, including gene conversion, site-specific DNA inversions, hypermutation, as well as recombination of sequence cassettes. In all cases, antigenic variation and phase variation result in a heterogenic phenotype of a clonal population. Individual cells either express the phase-variable protein(s) or express one of multiple antigenic forms of the protein. This form of regulation has been identified mainly, but not exclusively, for a wide variety of surface structures in pathogens and is implicated as a virulence strategy.",

Additionally, it can also survive in infected host debris. \"B. caryophylli\" infects susceptible plants through wounds which are present at the base and the crown of the host. The successful dissemination of the bacterial infection can occur Pre and post-planting. Pre-planting dissemination occurs when the stems of Carnation flowers from the infected host are cut and placed in a water bed with healthy plants, before they are individually planted (the bacteria slowly spreads from one cutting to the next via free water). Because of the possibility of transmission during the latent period, cuttings require cautious cultural measures. Post-planting dissemination may occur from one root system to the next via an existing canker in the infected plant. When the canker, which contains accumulated yellowish-brown bacterial slime, oozes out via an opening, the bacteria is released to the surrounding soil. \"B. caryophylli\" cannot travel long distances, and therefore, only infects neighboring plant roots systems. As the root system absorbs the nutrient and water from the soil, it also absorbs the soil-borne bacteria in the soil. Once inside the host, the bacterium aggregates towards the vascular system, finding its way to the phloem. It also blocks the xylem, cutting off the water circulation of the plant. Eventually, the roots are no longer able to anchor properly onto the soil. As the host plant wilts and dies, the bacteria overwinters in the host debris and soil.",

Often, a scarcity of nutrition and competition for resources from numerous other species occurs. Changes in pH and temperature are often significant, also. Bacteria often possess the ability to create exotoxins to assist them in competing with other microbes in their natural environments. When such bacteria are able to enter a living host, they encounter a vast supply of nutrients, warm conditions, and an abundance of water. This enables the microbes to rapidly proliferate, far in excess of the immune system's capability to defend, as prokaryotic bacteria possess a far greater capacity for multiplication than the host's immune system. The combination of bacterial load and ability to multiply is the basis for the microbes' ability to cause massive infection. Alongside such rapid proliferation is a corresponding mass-production of exotoxin that causes severe damage to local tissue in the host. One such exotoxin is alpha toxin, which is produced by \"C. perfringens\" and is the key virulence factor in its pathogenesis.",

The bacterial endosymbiont is inside its body and is surrounded by two membranes typical of Gram-negative bacteria, but its cell membrane presents unusual features, such as the presence of phosphatidylcholine, a major membrane lipid (atypical of bacterial membranes), and the highly reduced peptidoglycan layer, which shows reduced or absence of rigid cell wall. The cell membrane of the protozoan host contains an 18-domain \u03b2-barrel porin, which is a characteristic protein of Gram-negative bacteria. In addition it contains cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine as the major phospholipids, while sterols are absent. Cardiolipin is a typical lipid of bacterial membranes; phosphatidylcholine, on the other hand, is mostly present in symbiotic prokaryotes of eukaryotic cells. For symbiotic adaptation, the host trypanosome has undergone alterations such as reduced paraflagellar rod, which is required full motility of the bacterial flagella. Yet the paraflagellar rod gene \"PFR1\" is fully functional. The bacteria are known to provide essential nutrients to the host, and provide electron transport system for the production of cellular energy, the ATP molecules through its glycosomes. The bacteria synthesise amino acids, vitamins, and haem for the protozoan. In return the protozoan offers its enzymes for the complete metabolic pathways for the biosysnthesis of amino acids, lipids and nucleotides, that are absent in the bacterium. Phosphatidylinositol, a membrane lipid required for cell-cell interaction, in the bacteria is also synthesised by the protozoan. Thus the two organisms intimately share and exchange their metabolic systems. When the bacterium is killed using antibiotics, the protozoan can no longer infect insects, due to the altered glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gp63) in the protozoan flagellum.",

Bacterial HSP60 is causing the immune system to create anti-chaperonin antibodies, even though bacterial and human HSP60 have similar protein sequences.
