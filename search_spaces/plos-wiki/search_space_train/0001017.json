Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: Cellular Darwinism) A few evolutionarily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell. Cells and tissues can vary in competence, their ability to respond to external signals.",

Typical pathway model starts with extracellular signaling molecule that activates a specific protein. Thus triggers a chain of protein-protein or protein-small molecule interactions. Pathway analysis helps to understand or interpret omics data from the point of view of canonical prior knowledge structured in the form of pathways diagrams. It allows finding distinct cell processes (), diseases or signaling pathways that are statistically associated with selection of differentially expressed genes between two samples.

For example, neurons, muscle fibers and hepatocytes (liver cells) are well known types of differentiated cell. Differentiated cells usually produce large amounts of a few proteins that are required for their specific function and this gives them the characteristic appearance that enables them to be recognized under the light microscope. The genes encoding these proteins are highly active. Typically their chromatin structure is very open, allowing access for the transcription enzymes, and specific transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences in the DNA in order to activate gene expression. For example, NeuroD is a key transcription factor for neuronal differentiation, myogenin for muscle differentiation, and HNF4 for hepatocyte differentiation. Cell differentiation is usually the final stage of development, preceded by several states of commitment which are not visibly differentiated. A single tissue, formed from a single type of progenitor cell or stem cell, often consists of several differentiated cell types. Control of their formation involves a process of lateral inhibition, based on the properties of the Notch signaling pathway. For example, in the neural plate of the embryo this system operates to generate a population of neuronal precursor cells in which NeuroD is highly expressed.",

A gene serves as the source of a direct regulatory edge to a target gene by producing an RNA or protein molecule that functions as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor of the target gene. If the gene is an activator, then it is the source of a positive regulatory connection; if an inhibitor, then it is the source of a negative regulatory connection. Computational algorithms take as primary input data measurements of mRNA expression levels of the genes under consideration for inclusion in the network, returning an estimate of the network topology. Such algorithms are typically based on linearity, independence or normality assumptions, which must be verified on a case-by-case basis. Clustering or some form of statistical classification is typically employed to perform an initial organization of the high-throughput mRNA expression values derived from microarray experiments, in particular to select sets of genes as candidates for network nodes. The question then arises: how can the clustering or classification results be connected to the underlying biology? Such results can be useful for pattern classification \u2013 for example, to classify subtypes of cancer, or to predict differential responses to a drug (pharmacogenomics). But to understand the relationships between the genes, that is, to more precisely define the influence of each gene on the others, the scientist typically attempts to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory network. This can be done by data integration in dynamic models supported by background literature, or information in public databases, combined with the clustering results. The modelling can be done by a Boolean network, by Ordinary differential equations or Linear regression models, e.g. Least-angle regression, by Bayesian network or based on Information theory approaches.

Recently it was found that the network the Hippo signaling pathway operates in differs between these two functions which in turn changes the behavior of the Hippo signaling pathway. This suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context. Thus, changing network topology can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the final output of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element.

They can also infer associated upstream and downstream regulators, proteins, small molecules, drugs, etc. For example, pathway analysis of several independent microarray experiments (meta-analysis) helped to discover potential biomarkers in a single pathway important for fast-to-slow switch fiber type transition in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In other study meta-analysis identified two biomarkers in blood of patients with Parkinson's Disease, which can be useful for monitoring the disease.",

A more likely source of cellular plasticity is through the Regulation of gene expression, such that while two cells may have near identical DNA, the differential expression of certain genes results in variation. Research has shown that cells are capable of regulating gene expression at several stages: mRNA transcription, processing and transportation as well as in protein translation, post-translational processing and degradation. Regulatory proteins that bind to DNA, RNA, and/or proteins are key effectors in these processes and function by positively or negatively regulating specific protein level and function in a cell. And, while DNA binding transcription factors provide a mechanism for specific control of cellular responses, a model where DNA binding transcription factors are the sole regulators of gene activity is also unlikely. For example, in a study of Somatic-cell nuclear transfer, it was demonstrated that stable features of differentiation remain after the nucleus is transferred to a new cellular environment, suggesting that a stable and heritable mechanism of gene regulation was involved in the maintenance of the differentiated state in the absence of the DNA binding transcription factors.",

Multiplexing is achieved by probing multiple arrays spotted with the same lysate with different antibodies simultaneously and can be implemented as a quantitative calibrated assay. In addition, since RPMA can utilize whole-cell or undissected or microdissected cell lysates, it can provide direct quantifiable information concerning post translationally modified proteins that are not accessible with other high-throughput techniques. Thus, RPMA provides high-dimensional proteomic data in a high throughput, sensitive and quantitative manner. However, since the signal generated by RPMA could be generated from unspecific primary or secondary antibody binding, as is seen in other techniques such as ELISA, or immunohistochemistry, the signal from a single spot could be due to cross-reactivity. Thus, the antibodies used in RPMA must be carefully validated for specificity and performance against cell lysates by western blot.

Gal-4 was demonstrated to worsen the condition of intestinal inflammation by directly inducing the CD4+ T cells (cluster of differentiation 4) to produce IL-6(Interleukin) on TCR(T-cell receptor) mutational colitis model (Hokama et al., 2004). IL-6, a well-known inflammatory cytokine, could exacerbate intestinal inflammation in the presence of impaired mucosal barrier or injury to the mucosa. Furthermore, IL-6 was also confirmed to enhance the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2(Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl) through activating the STAT3(Signal transducer and activator of transcription) signal pathway, thus inhibiting the apoptosis of CD4+ T cells, and leading to sustainable development of IBD (Atreya et al., 2000; Allocca et al., 2013; Waldner and Neurath, 2014). Gal-4 may directly interact with the CD4+ T cells through binding to the immunological synapse, which is a specific activator of the protein kinase C(PKC) \u03b8-associated signaling cascade in lipid raft (Hokama et al., 2004; Nagahama et al., 2008). Through activating the PKC -associated pathway, galectin-4 stimulates the production of IL-6, therefore exacerbates intestinal inflammation. Anyway, it is not sure which receptor on intestinal CD4+ T cells particularly crosslinks with gal-4. It was found that an inducible colitis-associated glycome (CAG), which contains an immature (nonsialylated) core-1 O-glycan expressed by CD4+ T cells, was identified as a ligand of gal-4 under intestinal inflammatory conditions (Nishida et al., 2012). Thus, gal-4 may activate the PKC\u03b8 by binding to CAG and, then contributing to aggravation of colitis. In consistent with this, gal-4, which shows a high affinity to immature O-glycan (Ideo et al., 2002; Blixt et al., 2004), has been shown to exacerbate an experimental chronic colitis (Hokama et al., 2004). Nevertheless, Paclik D et al. demonstrated that gal-4 could induce T cell apoptosis by binding to the CD3 epitope at T cells surface on wild-type colitis model. Once binding to this epitope, gal-4 promotes apoptosis of T cells in calpain-dependent manner and reduces the secretion of cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17, and then improving the inflammation (Paclik et al., 2008a). Another research found that the role of gal-4 varied in different experimental colitis models (Mathieu et al., 2008). Based on the existing data, we can conclude that gal-4 may exacerbate intestinal inflammation in TCR mutational colitis model, while ameliorate intestinal inflammation in wild-type colitis model",

Most autoimmune disorders are believed to involve hyperactive Th1 or Th17 immune responses that are down regulated by the promotion of a Th2 response by helminths. Helminths secrete immunoregulatory molecules that promote the induction of regulatory T cells while inhibiting the function of antigen presenting cells and other T cells. As such, helminthic therapy attempts to restore homeostasis by shifting a hyperactive Th1 pro-inflammatory response to a Th2 response with reduced inflammation. Human and animal studies have provided evidence of decreased Th1 and Th17 immune responses with a shift to Th2 cytokine production resulting in significantly decreased levels of interleukin 12 and IFNy with simultaneous increases in the regulatory T cells, interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10 of test subjects. These observations indicate that helminth therapy can provide protection against autoimmune disease not only through prevention, since helminths can be present before autoimmune disease develops, but also after autoimmune responses are initiated.

Treg precursors exit the thymus expressing CD69 and complete differentiation into Treg cells in peripheral tissues when they encounter antigens and other cytokines, like IL-2. Through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, CD69 activation also induces the production of TGF-\u03b2 as well as IL-2, which contribute to the differentiation of Treg cells as mentioned above. Furthermore, CD69 is also known to be upregulated by NF-\u03baB signaling at the onset of an immune response. A prolonged immune response is then maintained by the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, which in turn is associated with Treg differentiation.",

This is an important \"self-check\" built into the immune system to prevent excessive reactions. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well-understood being those that express CD4, CD25, and FOXP3 (CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells). These \"Tregs\" are different from helper T cells. Another regulatory T cell subset is Treg17 cells. Regulatory T cells are involved in shutting down immune responses after they have successfully eliminated invading organisms, and also in preventing autoimmunity. CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells have been called \"naturally occurring\" regulatory T cells to distinguish them from \"suppressor\" T cell populations that are generated in vitro. Additional regulatory T cell populations include Tr1, Th3, CD8+CD28-, and Qa-1 restricted T cells. The contribution of these populations to self-tolerance and immune homeostasis is less well defined. Foxp3 can be used as a good marker for mouse CD4+CD25+ T cells, although recent studies have also shown evidence for Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD25- T cells. In humans, Foxp3 is also expressed by recently activated conventional T-cells and thus does not specifically identify human Tregs.",

While T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells have been reported as contributors to MS by increasing inflammation at myelin sites, human MAIT cells have also been observed at these sites. In addition, during periods of myelin degeneration, MAIT cell levels in the peripheral blood have been found to decrease, suggesting their tendency to migrate to sites of MS-related inflammation. At these sites, MAIT cells further contribute to the autoimmune response by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, in contrast to these findings, MAIT cells have also been found to display a protective role in MS by limiting Th1 cell secretion of IFN-\u03b3 at sites of inflammation. To explain these findings, the role of MAIT cells in MS must be further explored.",

They are triggered by IL-4 and IL-2, and their effector cytokines are IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13 and IL-25. The main effector cells are eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells as well as B cells, and IL-4/IL-5 CD4 T cells. The key T2 transcription factors are STAT6 and GATA3. IL-4 is the positive feedback cytokine for Th2 cells differentiation. Besides, IL-4 stimulates B-cells to produce IgE antibodies, which in turn stimulate mast cells to release histamine, serotonin, and leukotriene to cause broncho-constriction, intestinal peristalsis, gastric fluid acidification to expel helminths. IL-5 from CD4 T cells will activate eosinophils to attack helminths. IL-10 suppresses Th1 cells differentiation and function of dendritic cells. T2 overactivation against autoantigen will cause Type1 IgE-mediated allergy and hypersensitivity. Allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma belong to this category of autoimmunity. In addition to expressing different cytokines, Th2 cells also differ from Th1 cells in their cell surface glycans (oligosaccharides), which makes them less susceptible to some inducers of cell death.",

            "document": "Regulatory T cell . A number of different methods are employed in research to identify and monitor Treg cells. Originally, high expression of CD25 and CD4 surface markers was used (CD4CD25 cells). This is problematic as CD25 is also expressed on non-regulatory T cells in the setting of immune activation such as during an immune response to a pathogen. As defined by CD4 and CD25 expression, regulatory T cells comprise about 5\u201310% of the mature CD4 T cell subpopulation in mice and humans, while about 1\u20132% of Treg can be measured in whole blood. The additional measurement of cellular expression of Foxp3 protein allowed a more specific analysis of Treg cells (CD4CD25Foxp3 cells). However, Foxp3 is also transiently expressed in activated human effector T cells, thus complicating a correct Treg analysis using CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 as markers in humans. Therefore, some research groups use another marker, the absence or low-level expression of the surface protein CD127 in combination with the presence of CD4 and CD25. Several additional markers have been described, e.g., high levels of CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated molecule-4) and GITR (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor) are also expressed on regulatory T cells, however the functional significance of this expression remains to be defined. There is a great interest in identifying cell surface markers that are uniquely and specifically expressed on all Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells. However, to date no such molecule has been identified.",

            "document": "Helminthic therapy . Although the mechanism(s) of autoimmune disease development is not fully defined, there is broad agreement that the majority of autoimmune diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to innocuous antigens, driven by a branch of the immune system known as the TH1 type immune response. Extra-cellular antigens primarily trigger the TH2 response, as observed with allergies, while intracellular antigens trigger a TH1 response. Th cells can be divided into subtypes based on the characteristic cytokines they secrete. Th2 immune responses result in the release of cytokines associated with inflammation reduction such as interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10. These cytokines are thought to improve the symptoms of many autoimmune disorders. Conversely, Th1 immune responses are characterized by the cytokines interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), both of which are thought to increase inflammation and worsen the progression of autoimmune diseases and their symptoms. The relationship between these two types of immune response is a central theme of the biological basis of the hygiene hypothesis, which suggests that there is a regulatory action between the two types of response. However, the observation that allergies and autoimmune response are increasing at a similar rate in industrialized nations appears to undermine the hygiene hypothesis.",
