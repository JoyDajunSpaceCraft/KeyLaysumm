Transmission of the bacterium is also known to occur via consumption of infected water, close contact with, or handling of rats. Haverhill fever, named after the 1926 outbreak of the disease in Haverhill, Massachusetts, is a form of rat bite fever that can result from ingesting food contaminated with \"S. moniliformis\". In 1986 at a boarding school in the United Kingdom, another outbreak of Haverhill fever was reported. Some 304 people were reported to have been afflicted. Infection was suspected to have resulted from the consumption of either unpasteurized milk or water contaminated with rat feces. Infected individuals described symptoms including a sudden development of vomiting, severe headache, and cold sweats with a high fever. Parker and Hudson first isolated the cause of this outbreak, which they named \"Haverhilia multiformis\". This organism was later matched to \"S. moniliformis\" after further research.",

The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound.

There being only one described species in the genus, they considered the human parasite to be \"P. carinii\". Nine years later (1951), Dr. Josef Vanek at Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia, showed in a study of lung sections from 16 children that the organism labelled \"\"P. carinii\"\" was the causative agent of pneumonia in these children. The following year, J\u00edrovec reported \"\"P. carinii\"\" as the cause of interstitial pneumonia in neonates. Following the realization that \"Pneumocystis\" from humans could not infect experimental animals such as rats, and that the rat form of \"Pneumocystis\" differed physiologically and had different antigenic properties, Frenkel was the first to recognize the human pathogen as a distinct species. He named it \"\"Pneumocystis jiroveci\"\" (corrected to \"P. jirovecii\" - see nomenclature above). Controversy existed over the relabeling of \"P. carinii\" in humans as \"P. jirovecii\", which is why both names still appear in publications. However, only the name \"P. jirovecii\" is used exclusively for the human pathogen, whereas the name \"P. carinii\" has had a broader application to many species. Frenkel and those before him believed that all \"Pneumocystis\" were protozoans, but soon afterwards evidence began accumulating that \"Pneumocystis\" was a fungal genus. Recent studies show it to be an unusual, in some ways a primitive genus of Ascomycota, related to a group of yeasts. Every tested primate, including humans, appears to have its own type of \"Pneumocystis\" that is incapable of cross-infecting other host species and has co-evolved with each species. Currently, only five species have been formally named: \"P. jirovecii\" from humans, \"P. carinii\" as originally named from rats, \"P. murina\" from mice, \"P. wakefieldiae\" also from rats, and \"P. oryctolagi\" from rabbits.",

He found a total of 45\u00a0species, a number unequaled in rodents. This may be related to the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the saltwater marsh were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater marsh by nematodes (roundworms).

If it also causes bleeding into the lungs then it is known as severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome. Up to 13 different genetic types of \"Leptospira\" may cause disease in humans. It is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals. The most common animals that spread the disease are rodents. It is often transmitted by animal urine or by water or soil containing animal urine coming into contact with breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose. In the developing world the disease most commonly occurs in farmers and poor people who live in cities. In the developed world it most commonly occurs in those involved in outdoor activities in warm and wet areas of the world. Diagnosis is typically by looking for antibodies against the bacterium or finding its DNA in the blood. Efforts to prevent the disease include protective equipment to prevent contact when working with potentially infected animals, washing after this contact, and reducing rodents in areas people live and work. The antibiotic doxycycline, when used in an effort to prevent infection among travellers, is of unclear benefit. Vaccines for animals exist for certain type of \"Leptospira\" which may decrease the risk of spread to humans. Treatment if infected is with antibiotics such as: doxycycline, penicillin, or ceftriaxone. Weil's disease and severe pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome result in death rates greater than 10% and 50%, respectively, even with treatment. It is estimated that seven to ten million people are infected by leptospirosis per year. The number of deaths this causes is not clear.

The disease was first described by physician Adolf Weil in 1886 in Germany. Animals which are infected may have no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may vary by the type of animal. In some animals \"Leptospira\" live in the reproductive tract, leading to transmission during mating.",

Also, the DNA of \"Y. pestis\" has been identified in the teeth of the human victims, the same DNA which has been widely believed to have come from the infected rodents. He does not deny the point that there exists a pneumonic expression of \"Y. pestis\" transmitted by human-to-human contact, but he states that this does not spread as easily as previous historians have imagined. The rat, according to him, is the only plausible agent of transmission that could have led to such a wide and quick spread of the plague. This is because of rats' proclivity to associate with humans and the ability of their blood to withstand very large concentrations of the bacillus. When rats died, their fleas (which were infected with bacterial blood) found new hosts in the form of humans and animals. The Black Death tapered off in the eighteenth century, and according to McCormick, a rat-based theory of transmission could explain why this occurred. The plague(s) had killed a large portion of the human host population of Europe and dwindling cities meant that more people were isolated, and so geography and demography did not allow rats to have as much contact with Europeans. Greatly curtailed communication and transportation systems due to the drastic decline in human population also hindered the replenishment of devastated rat colonies.",

Human \"F. hepatica\" infection is determined by the presence of the intermediate snail hosts, domestic herbivorous animals, climatic conditions and the dietary habits of man. Sheep, goats and cattle are considered the predominant animal reservoirs. While other animals can be infected, they are usually not very important for human disease transmission. On the other hand, some authors have observed that donkeys and pigs contribute to disease transmission in Bolivia. Among wild animals, it has been demonstrated that the peridomestic rat (\"Rattus rattus\") may play an important role in the spread as well as in the transmission of the parasite in Corsica. In France, nutria (\"Myocastor coypus\") was confirmed as a wild reservoir host of \"F. hepatica\". Humans are infected by ingestion of aquatic plants that contain the infectious cercariae. Several species of aquatic vegetables are known as a vehicle of human infection. In Europe, \"Nasturtium officinale\" (common watercress), \"Nasturtium silvestris\", \"Rorippa amphibia\" (wild watercress), \"Taraxacum dens leonis\" (dandelion leaves), \"Valerianella olitoria\" (lamb's lettuce), and \"Mentha viridis\" (spearmint) were reported as a source of human infections. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, some authors suggested that several aquatic plants such as bero-bero (watercress), algas (algae), kjosco and tortora could act as a source of infection for humans. Because \"F. hepatica\" cercariae also encyst on water surface, humans can be infected by drinking of fresh untreated water containing cercariae. In addition, an experimental study suggested that humans consuming raw liver dishes from fresh livers infected with juvenile flukes could become infected.",

Leptospiral LPS has low endotoxin activity. An unusual feature of leptospiral LPS is that it activates host cells via TLR2 rather than TLR4. The unique structure of the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule may account for this observation.
