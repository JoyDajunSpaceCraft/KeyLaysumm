A study published in the scientific journal \"Nature\" determined the reason why the angiosperm doesn\u2019t flower is due to a genetic impairment of the gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic gene, EaGA3ox1. This impairment causes the plant to be unable to develop bioactive GAs, which is what is responsible for the flowering of plants via the floral meristem identity gene EaLFY. In \"E. aureum\", the floral meristem identity gene is absent due to the lack of GAs from EaGA3ox1. Additionally, it was found that when GAs were scientifically placed into the plant, flowering was induced.",

Plant sRNA pathways are understood to be important components of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Bacteria\u2010induced miRNAs in Arabidopsis have been shown to influence hormonal signalling including auxin, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). . Advances in genome\u2010wide studies revealed a massive adaptation of host miRNA expression patterns after infection by fungal pathogens \"Fusarium virguliforme,\" \"Erysiphe graminis\", \"Verticillium dahliae\", and \"Cronartium quercuum\", and the oomycete \"Phytophthora sojae\". Changes to sRNA expression in response to fungal pathogens indicate that gene silencing may be involved in this defense pathway. However, there is also evidence that the antifungal defense response to \"Colletotrichum\" spp. infection in maize is not entirely regulated by specific miRNA induction, but may instead act to fine-tune the balance between genetic and metabolic components upon infection. \u00a0",
