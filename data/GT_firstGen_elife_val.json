Most cells in an organism contain the same genetic information , but different types of cell use the information differently . For example , many of the genes that are active in a muscle cell are different from those that are active in a skin cell . These different patterns of gene activation largely determine a cell\u2019s identity and are brought about by DNA-binding proteins or chemical modifications to the DNA ( which are both forms of so-called epigenetic regulation ) . Nevertheless , cells occasionally change their identities \u2013 a phenomenon that is referred to as reprograming . This process allows tissues to be regenerated after wounding , but , due to technical difficulties , reprograming has been often studied in isolated cells grown in a dish . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . set out to understand how being surrounded by intact tissue influences reprograming . The experiments made use of C . elegans worms , because disturbing how this worm\u2019s DNA is packaged can trigger its cells to undergo reprograming . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . show that a signaling pathway that is found in many different animals enhances this kind of reprograming in C . elegans . On the one hand , these findings help in understanding how epigenetic regulation can be altered by a specific tissue environment . On the other hand , the findings also suggest that abnormal signaling can result in altered epigenetic control of gene expression and lead to cells changing their identity . Indeed , increased signaling is linked to a major epigenetic mechanism seen in specific blood tumors , suggesting that the regulatory principles uncovered using this simple worm model could eventually provide insights into a human disease . A future challenge will be to determine precisely how the studied signaling pathway interacts with the epigenetic regulator that controls reprograming . Understanding this interaction in molecular detail could help to devise strategies for controlling reprograming . These strategies could in turn lead to treatments for people with conditions that cause specific cells types to be lost , such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or injuries .",
        "first_gen": "Cell-fate decisions are controlled by a process called reprograming, in which the cell\u2019s chromatin is switched on or off. This process is controlled, on the one hand, by signaling from a cell niche to the recipient cell. However, it is not clear how this process works, and how it can be controlled in intact tissues. To investigate this question, Tursun, Patel et al. studied the germline of a worm called C. elegans. In this worm, the gene for a protein called GLP-1/Notch is turned on, but this protein is silenced by another gene called LIN-53, which is required for cells to become pluripotent. The gene that encodes this gene is called the histone demethylase ( or PRC2 for short ). It is also known to regulate the activity of other genes, such as a transcription factor called LAG-5. These genes are also involved in the process of converting germ cells into neurons. But it was not known whether the genes that activate the Notch signaling pathway were also activated by the same gene, or if they were simply switched off by an enzyme called UTX-2. Now, Riddle and Patel have investigated whether this is the case. First, they used a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis and functional studies to find out if this enzyme is a key target of the notch pathway. Further experiments showed that this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germ-line stem cells and that it also promotes the conversion of stem-cell into neuron-like cells. Finally, using a technique called functional analysis of human cells, these experiments revealed that the human immune system is better able to control the expression of certain genes than previously thought. By inhibiting the production of histones, this new knowledge could lead to new treatments for diseases associated with abnormal gene expression."

These infections can be difficult to treat because some K . pneumoniae are resistant to antibiotics .

This implies that healthy people\u2019s immune systems are better able to fend off K . pneumoniae infections; learning how could help scientists develop new ways to treat or prevent infections in hospitalized patients . In healthy people , a type of immune cell called neutrophils are the first line of defense against bacterial infections . Several different proteins are needed to activate neutrophils , including a protein called SKAP2 . But the role of this protein in fighting K . pneumoniae infections is not clear . To find out what role SKAP2 plays in the defense against pneumonia caused by K . pneumoniae , Nguyen et al . compared infections in mice with and without the protein . Mice lacking SKAP2 in their white blood cells had more bacteria in their lungs than normal mice . The experiments showed that neutrophils from mice with SKAP2 produce a burst of chemicals called \u201creactive oxygen species\u201d , which can kill bacteria . But neutrophils without the protein do not . Without SKAP2 , several proteins that help produce reactive oxygen species do not work . Understanding the role of SKAP2 in fighting infections may help scientists better understand the immune system . This could help clinicians to treat conditions that cause it to be hyperactive or ineffective . More studies are needed to determine if SKAP2 works the same way in human neutrophils and if it works against all types of K . pneumoniae .

        "first_gen": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a bacterium that can cause pneumonia, sepsis and other life-threatening infections. It is an opportunistic pathogen that infects the lungs of patients with pneumonia. The disease is caused by a type of immune system called the neutrophil, which is able to bind to the bacteria that cause the infection. Neutrophils are the first responder cell type for fighting against invading bacteria. However, they are also vulnerable to infection by other bacteria, including those that are resistant to antibiotics. One of the most common causes of pneumonia is the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in the blood and urine of infected patients. A protein called SKAP2 is required for K. pneumonia to work properly in healthy mice, but it is not clear how this protein works. To investigate this question, Bortoletto et al. used mice that had been genetically engineered to have mutations in a gene that encodes an adaptor protein. These mice had a 100-fold higher burden of ROS in their lungs compared to normal mice. In addition, the mice also had higher levels of a protein that helps to regulate ROS production. Further experiments showed that the same protein is also required to protect the immune cells against K. pneumonia from other pathogens. This protein was also found to be involved in regulating the activity of several other proteins that help to control ROS levels. Moreover, it was shown that these proteins were also important for protecting the cells that produce ROS, and that they also play an important role in controlling the production of other signaling pathways that promote ROS activity."

        "ground_truth": "Malaria is one of the world's most deadly infections , causing 100s of 1000s of deaths each year despite being both preventable and curable . Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites , which are transmitted between humans by mosquitoes . When a mosquito bites a human , Plasmodium is injected into the bloodstream with the mosquito's saliva . The parasite then travels through the bloodstream to the liver , infects liver cells and multiplies within those cells without causing any noticeable symptoms . After remaining silent in the liver for weeks or months , the now abundant parasite ruptures the host liver cell , re-enters the bloodstream , and begins infecting red blood cells . If another mosquito bites the infected individual and takes a blood meal , the parasite moves into the mosquito and the cycle of transmission continues . There are several species of Plasmodium that are known to cause malaria . The most widely studied species is P . falciparum , which also causes one of the deadliest types of malaria . However , another Plasmodium species called P . vivax is the most widely distributed species and , despite being less virulent than P . falciparum , is particularly dangerous because it causes recurring malaria . In contrast to P . falciparum , P . vivax has the ability to form hypnozoites: a dormant form of the parasite that can remain inside liver cells for long periods of time , sometimes for years . The reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites can regularly populate the bloodstream with the infectious form of the parasite , triggering relapses of malaria . Even if an individual suffering a relapse receives prompt treatment to clear parasites in the blood , more parasites may emerge from the liver and cause new blood-stage infections . White et al . developed a mathematical model to help understand how P . vivax is transmitted . Unlike many of the established models of malaria transmission , the new model accounts for the reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites in the liver , and assumes that hypnozoites in the reservoir either die , or are activated and enter the bloodstream , at a constant rate . This produces patterns that closely match how often relapses occur in patients . White et al . go on to predict that although many infected people have few or no hypnozoites in their liver , some have many hypnozoites , and these people are more likely to suffer from malaria relapses . This suggests that if the initial treatments given to malaria sufferers incorporate additional drugs that kill the hypnozoites in the liver , then it may be possible to substantially reduce the extent of P . vivax transmission .",
        "first_gen": "Plasmodium falciparum ( P. vivax ) is one of the most widely distributed species of malaria in the world, causing an estimated 80\u2013300 million clinical episodes every year. However, it is not well understood how the transmission of this parasite between human and mosquito-borne diseases is controlled. To investigate this, Battle et al. developed a mathematical model of how malaria transmission occurs. The model is based on mathematical models that describe how a parasite called hypnozoites activate and die after a mosquito bites a human. These models are used to predict how many times a person will relapse from a malaria-causing infection, and how long it will take for the parasite to die. This model predicts that individuals with the highest levels of these parasites will be more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment. In the future, the model could also be applied to other malaria parasites, such as the Anopheles mosquito."

        "ground_truth": "The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest tropical forest in the world . Along with being home to a huge variety of plants and wildlife , rainforests also play an important role in storing an element called carbon , which is a core component of all life on Earth . Certain forms of carbon , such as the gas carbon dioxide , contribute to climate change so researchers want to understand what factors affect how much carbon is stored in rainforests . Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then incorporate the carbon into carbohydrates and other biological molecules . The Amazon rainforest alone holds around 30% of the total carbon stored in land-based ecosystems . Humans selectively harvest certain species of tree that produce wood with commercial value from the Amazon rainforest . This \u201cselective logging\u201d results in the loss of stored carbon from the rainforest , but the loss can be compensated for in the medium to long term if the forest is left to regrow . New trees and trees that survived the logging grow to fill the gaps left by the felled trees . However , it is not clear how differences in the forest ( for example , forest maturity ) , environmental factors ( such as climate or soil ) and the degree of the disturbance caused by the logging affect the ability of the forest ecosystem to recover the lost carbon . Piponiot et al . used computer modeling to analyze data from over a hundred different forest plots across the Amazon rainforest . The models show that the forest\u2019s ability to recover carbon after selective logging greatly differs between regions . For example , the overall amount of carbon recovered in the first ten years is predicted to be higher in a region in the north known as the Guiana Shield than in the south of the Amazonian basin where the climate is less favorable . The findings of Piponiot et al . highlight the key role the trees that survive selective logging play in carbon recovery . The next step would be to couple this model to historical maps of logging to estimate how the areas of the rainforest that are managed by selective logging shape the overall carbon balance of the Amazon rainforest .",
        "first_gen": "When 2 Mha of forests are disturbed by selective logging each year, more than 90 Tg of carbon dioxide ( or CO2 ) is emitted to the atmosphere. These carbon emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth. However, it is not clear how much of this carbon is actually lost. To address this question, Sist et al. have used a computer model to estimate the extent of the carbon loss in the Amazonian Amazon. The model identified 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha in total ) across Amazonia, which cover a large area of land. This revealed that, in some cases, the loss of a forest\u2019s aboveground carbon stocks is offset by the recovery of forested areas that are used for agriculture and grazing. In other instances, forest loss is compensated for by increased growth of survivors and recruited trees, but it remains difficult to accurately predict how this recovery will be achieved. Here, Vidal and Asner use computer models to model the effects of selective logging on forest regeneration. They show that the rate at which the forest is re-forested over 10 years is higher in regions where there is high rainfall and high seasonality than in areas where it was previously logged. Overall, these findings provide a comprehensive map of post-logging carbon recovery potential in tropical forests."

        "ground_truth": "Neurons that arise in the adult nervous system originate from neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells . Neural stem cells have long lives , much of which they spend in a quiescent state . Neural stem cells can also give rise to neural progenitor cells , which proliferate rapidly during their short lives and then \u2018differentiate\u2019 into neurons or glia . Unlike some other tissues , it has not been possible to identify or purify neural stem cells directly from the tissue . Consequently , neural stem and progenitor cells have usually been studied retrospectively , based on their ability to form colonies in laboratory cell cultures . A region of the brain called the subventricular zone contains both neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells , and is one of only two regions of the brain where neural stem cells are found in adult mammals . When cells from the subventricular zone are cultured in a way that allows the cells to freely float around ( rather than growing on a surface ) , a few percent form spherical colonies called neurospheres . Since neurosphere-forming cells can self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia , the ability of cells to form neurospheres has generally been taken as evidence that they are stem cells . However , the exact relationship between neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells has been uncertain . Now , Mich , Signer et al . have used a technique called flow cytometry to identify and isolate neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells directly from the subventricular zone . The neural stem cells , which Mich , Signer et al . term pre-GEPCOT cells ( based on an acronym of the markers used to isolate the cells ) , were long-lived and quiescent , but they lacked the ability to form colonies in culture . The neurosphere-forming cells , named GEPCOT cells , were short-lived and highly proliferative in the brain . These results demonstrate that the cells that form neurospheres in culture are not stem cells at all , and that real stem cells are not able to form colonies under existing culture conditions . The identification of undifferentiated pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells will make it possible to directly study the properties of these cells inside the mouse brain , and to isolate live cells to test how they function . The results also highlight the need for new tests to study neural stem cell function , given that current tests using neurospheres do not detect stem cells as commonly assumed .",

To investigate this question, Doetsch et al. used a technique called flow cytometry to study the activity of neurons in adult mouse lateral ventricular zone ( SVZ ) cells. The experiments showed that the cells that form the neurons form a network of neural spheres, which is similar to the ones that make up a brain cell. This network is made up of a number of different types of cells and is thought to be responsible for the development of new neurons and astrocytes. Previous studies have shown that these neural cells form networks of nerve cells within the adult brain, but it was not known whether they also have other roles. In the future, the next challenge will be to identify and isolate these networks."

        "ground_truth": "Cells can sense a range of mechanical forces both inside and outside the body , such as the stroke of a fingertip or the filling of a lung . Pores on the surface of the cell called Piezo channels open up in response to this pressure . This allows ions to flood in to the cell and trigger a series of biochemical reactions that alter the cell\u2019s behavior . Piezo channels have a unique bowl-like structure that transforms the shape of the cell surface around them , potentially affecting how nearby proteins behave . Previous research had suggested that these channels might be unevenly distributed across the cell surface , and were predicted to modify each other\u2019s behaviors when tightly packed together . This cooperative response would have a significant impact on how cells sense mechanical force . To investigate if this was the case , Lewis and Grandl studied a mouse cell called Neuro2A which naturally produces Piezo ion channels . In the experiment , pressure was applied to different parts of the cell and the electric current generated by ions moving across the surface was recorded: the higher the electrical activity , the more ion channels present . This showed that Piezo channels are randomly distributed across the cell surface and do not tend to cluster together . The same Neuro2A cells were then engineered to produce up to one hundred times more Piezo proteins . Despite the channels being more densely packed together , how they responded to mechanical force remained the same . These results suggest that Piezo channels act independently and are not influenced by close proximity to one another . Lewis and Grandl propose that this property may ensure that all parts of the cell surface react to mechanical force in the same way . Further work is needed to see if this finding applies to other cell types that produce Piezo proteins .",

For example, a protein called Piezo1 is a mechanically gated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. However, it is not clear how this mechanism works. To investigate this question, Kefauver et al. used a technique called patch-clamp electrophysiology to study the structure of a piezo channel in human neural stem cells. The experiments revealed that the shape and size of the channel can influence how it senses forces. In particular, the size and shape of these ion channels could influence their sensitivity to forces that occur in milliseconds. This suggests that these channels may be independent mechanotransducers, and that they may interact with each other in a way that is likely to be physiologically relevant."

        "ground_truth": "Many of our decisions are made on the basis of imperfect or \u2018noisy\u2019 information . A longstanding goal in neuroscience is to work out how such noise affects three aspects of decision-making: the accuracy ( or appropriateness ) of a choice , the speed at which the choice is made , and the decision-maker\u2019s confidence that they have chosen correctly . One theory of decision-making is that the brain simultaneously accumulates evidence for each of the options it is considering , until one option exceeds a threshold and is declared the \u2018winner\u2019 . This theory is known as bounded evidence accumulation . It predicts that increasing the noisiness of the available information decreases the accuracy of decisions made in response . Counterintuitively , it also predicts that such an increase in noise speeds up decision-making and increases confidence levels . Zylberberg et al . have now tested these predictions experimentally by getting human volunteers and monkeys to perform a series of trials where they had to decide whether a set of randomly moving dots moved to the left or to the right overall . Using a newly developed method , the noisiness of the dot motion could be changed between trials . The effectiveness of this technique was confirmed by recording the activity of neurons in the region of the monkey brain that processes visual motion information . After each trial , the humans rated their confidence in their decision . By comparison , the monkeys could indicate that they were not confident in a decision by opting for a guaranteed small reward on certain trials ( instead of the larger reward they received when they correctly indicated the direction of motion of the dots ) . In both humans and monkeys , increasing the noisiness associated with the movement of the dots led to faster and more confident decision-making , just as the bounded evidence accumulation framework predicts . Furthermore , the results presented by Zylberberg et al . suggest that the brain does not always gauge how reliable evidence is in order to fine-tune decisions . Now that the role of noise in decision-making is better understood , future experiments could attempt to reveal how artificial manipulations of the brain contribute both information and noise to a decision . Other experiments might ascertain when the brain can learn that noisy information should invite slower , more cautious decisions .",
        "first_gen": "When we make a decision, we are not hard wired or reflexive. Instead, our decision-making process relies on the accumulation of information from different sources, such as noise. This information accumulates over time, and is known as decision confidence. However, it is not clear how the process of decision formation gives rise to decision speed and accuracy. To answer this question, Fetsch et al. used a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation ( or TMS for short ) to study the brain activity of monkeys and humans. The experiments showed that the noise in the visual cortex of the monkeys increased the amount of noise that could be added to the signal-to-noise ratio. In the experiments, the recordings were recorded from the brains of both humans and monkeys. These recordings revealed that when noise was increased, monkeys were more likely to make decisions based on their decision accuracy and confidence over a range of stimuli, including coffee or tea. Further experiments confirmed that noise increases the number of dots that are present simultaneously, which suggests that they are more accurate than previously thought. Moreover, this increase in noise caused monkeys to be more confident about the accuracy of their decisions. Overall, these findings suggest that a brain process called decision learning is governed by three key observables: speed, accuracy, confidence and reaction time."

        "ground_truth": "Although aging might seem to be a passive process\u2014resulting simply from wear and tear over a lifetime\u2014it can actually be accelerated or slowed down by genetic mutations . This phenomenon has been most thoroughly studied in the nematode worm , Caenorhabditis elegans . Normally , this worm lives for just two or three weeks , but genetic mutations that reduce the activity of certain enzymes in a series of biochemical reactions known as the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway can extend its lifespan by up to a factor of ten , and similar effects have been seen in flies and mice . Lifespans can also be increased by blocking other signalling pathways or restricting the intake of calories . This increase in lifespan associated with the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway is known to involve a protein called DAF-16 and two kinases called AKT-1 and AKT-2 . Under normal conditions the AKT kinases add several phosphate groups to the DAF-16 , which prevents it from travelling to the nucleus of the cell . However , when genetic techniques are used to block the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway , the AKT kinases are unable to add the phosphate groups; this leaves the DAF-16 free to enter the nucleus , where it activates a network of genes that promotes longevity . In addition to kinases , the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway also involves enzymes called phosphatases that remove the phosphate groups from other proteins . In particular , a phosphatase called calcineurin is known to be involved in the regulation of lifespan , but the details of this process are not fully understood . Now , Tao et al . have carried out a series of genetic and biochemical experiments to determine how phosphatases exert their influence on aging . The results show that calcineurin targets DAF-16 , the same protein that is targeted by the AKT kinases . Moreover , another kinase also targets DAF-16 when the worm is exposed to heat , starvation or some other form of stress: this kinase , which is not involved in the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway , is called CAMKII . Tao et al . show that these kinases act on DAF-16 in different ways: CAMKII activates it by adding the phosphate group at a specific site known as S286 , whereas the AKT kinases deactivate DAF-16 because they add phosphate groups at different sites , thereby preventing it from entering the nucleus . Calcineurin neutralizes the effect of CAMKII by removing the phosphate group at S286 to deactivate the DAF-16 . In addition to shedding new light on the regulation of lifespan in C . elegans , the new results could improve our understanding of aging in humans , and also the development of diabetes and other age-related diseases , because the equivalent molecules in mammalian cells are regulated in similar ways .",

A protein called DAF-16 is a transcription factor that regulates the activity of a number of signaling pathways, including the insulin signaling pathway and the FOXO pathway. However, it was not known how this protein controls the lifespan of the worms. Now, Greer, Brunet et al. have shown that a gene called TAX-6\u2022CNB-1, which encodes a protein that is phosphorylated and activated by the AKT kinases, also regulates lifespan in the C. elegan worm. Calcineurin, a phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphatase, and another kinase called CAMKII regulate lifespan by removing the phosphate group from the protein. This protein is also known to regulate the activities of other transcription factors, such as genes that encode proteins that are involved in cell division. The experiments show that the two proteins interact with each other in response to different stress conditions. In addition, the enzymes that activate these interactions are also found in other species, like flies and mice. Further work is now needed to understand how these two enzymes interact."

        "ground_truth": "Anyone who has ever lived with a cat is familiar with its grooming behavior . This innate behavior follows a particular sequence as the cat methodically cleans its body parts one-by-one . Many animals also have grooming habits , even insects such as fruit flies . The fact that grooming sequences are seen across such different species suggests that this behavior is important for survival . Nevertheless , how the brain organizes grooming sequences , or other behaviors that involve a sequence of tasks , is not well understood . Fruit flies make a good model for studying grooming behavior for a couple of reasons . First , they are fastidious cleaners . When coated with dust they will faithfully carry out a series of cleaning tasks to clean each body part . Second , there are many genetic tools and techniques that researchers can use to manipulate the fruit flies' behaviors . One technique allows specific brain cells to be targeted and activated to trigger particular behaviors . Seeds et al . used these sophisticated techniques , computer modeling , and behavioral observations to uncover how the brains of fruit flies orchestrate a grooming sequence . Dust-covered flies follow a predictable sequence of cleaning tasks: beginning by using their front legs to clean their eyes , they then clean their antennae and head . This likely helps to protect their sensory organs . Next , they move on to the abdomen , possibly to ensure that dust doesn't interfere with their ability to breathe . Wings and thorax follow last . Periodically , the flies stop to rub their legs together to remove any accumulated dust before resuming the cleaning sequence . Seeds et al . activated different sets of brain cells one-by-one to see if they could trigger a particular grooming task and found that individual cleaning tasks could be triggered , in the absence of dust , by stimulating a specific group of brain cells . This suggests each cleaning task is a discrete behavior controlled by a subset of cells . Then Seeds et al . tried to stimulate more than one cleaning behavior at a time; they discovered that wing-cleaning suppressed thorax-cleaning , abdomen-cleaning suppressed both of these , and head-cleaning suppressed all the others . This suggests that a \u2018hierarchy\u2019 exists in the brain that exactly matches the sequence that flies normally follow as they clean their body parts . By learning more about how the brain coordinates grooming sequences , the findings of Seeds et al . may also provide insights into other behaviors that involve a sequence of tasks , such as nest building in animals or typing in humans . Following on from this work , one of the next challenges will be to see if such behaviors also use a \u2018suppression hierarchy\u2019 to ensure that individual tasks are carried out in the right order .",
        "first_gen": "Animals engage in a variety of complex serial behaviors that are essential for survival. For example, fruit flies groom their bodies with their front legs and hind legs. Fruit flies use a technique called \u201cgrooming\u201d to clean their body parts, which is similar to bird song. However, it is not clear how the fruit fly\u2019s nervous system determines which actions to perform. To investigate this question, Fentress and Stilwell developed a new tool that can be used to identify the neurons that drive the behavior. The tool was genetically engineered to detect the activity of specific neurons in the brain, and it was then programmed to selectively clean individual parts of the body in sequence. This revealed that the motor programs that were activated in each sequence were organized into a suppression hierarchy. When the flies were given a chance to groom, they cleaned their entire body, but only when they had already started cleaning the other parts. Fertress et al. then used genetically targeted mice to drive a series of movements that clean the fly's body. These movements were successful in reproducing the grooming sequence, even though they did not occur in sequential sequences. Further experiments showed that these movements are driven by the same neural activity that is activated when a fly cleans its body part. In the experiments, the mice were then exposed to different types of electrical stimulation that reduced the amount of dust that was left on the surface of each fly. As a result, each movement was more efficient than the previous one. Future experiments will be able to test whether this model is also applied to other animals, such as birds and insects."

This means a \u2018parent\u2019 cell in the ovaries or testes undergoes two stages of cell division: it first divides into two cells , which then divide again to produce four \u2018daughter\u2019 cells . A crucial part of meiosis is ensuring that each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes that the parent cell did . Before the first round of meiosis , the chromosomes in the parent cell are copied to produce enough chromosomes for the four daughter cells . The distribution of these chromosomes between the daughter cells is determined by the opposing forces acting on them . The pairs of identical chromosomes produced during the copying process are held together by a proteinaceous glue , while microtubules attached to a structure called the spindle\u2014which has poles at opposite ends of the cell\u2014try to pull these pairs of chromosomes apart . Rattani et al . now show that a protein called shugoshin-like 2 ( Sgol2 ) , which is involved in holding pairs of identical chromosomes together after the first round of division , has a bigger role than was previously realised . Sgol2 performs three other functions: it helps to align the chromosomes prior to division by , it is thought , facilitating the formation of the K-fibers that attach the microtubules to the chromosomes; it turns off the checkpoint that monitors the alignment of the chromosomes and the attachment of the microtubules; and it regulates a number of the enzymes involved in the process . The specific interactions that allow Sgol2 to perform these diverse functions in meiosis were also identified . Thus , Rattani et al . show that in linking so many essential processes throughout meiosis , Sgol2 appears to have a key , if not unique , role in determining the fate of chromosomes as cells divide .",
        "first_gen": "When a cell divides, its chromosomes are attached to each other in a process called chromosome segregation. This process is called meiosis I and II, and it involves the attachment of chromosomes to the surface of the microtubules that hold the cell\u2019s chromosomes together. However, it is not clear how these processes are coordinated. Now, Tachibana-Konwalski et al. show that a protein called Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) plays an important role in preventing chromosomes from being separated in the first or second meiotic division. The protein is made up of two groups of proteins: one called the spindle assembly checkpoint ( or SAC for short ) and the other called cohesin. Together, the two proteins protect the chromosomes by binding directly to one another, which prevents them from separating. In addition to protecting chromosomes, this protein also helps to prevent the formation of bivalents and prevents the cells from dividing too quickly. These interactions are regulated by a complex of molecules called spindles that are responsible for keeping chromosomes separated from the rest of their siblings. Mutations in one of these proteins can cause chromosome separation in mammals, but it remains unclear how they work together and why they do so. To address this question, researchers have now discovered that in mammalian oocytes the protein 1 is able to turn off the sAC and stop it from interfering with the activity of another protein, called PP2A. Further experiments showed that the proteins also help to shut off a second checkpoint called MCAK. Understanding how this is coordinated is important because it will help us to understand how chromosomes segregate in humans and other animals."

        "ground_truth": "The nervous system contains billions of cells called neurons that connect to each other to form complex networks via junctions known as synapses . Synapses form between the end of an elongated section ( called the axon ) of one neuron and the tiny projections ( or dendrites ) from the cell body of the next neuron . Throughout the lifespan of an animal , the nervous system responds to experiences and stimuli from the environment by changing the strength of the connections at synapses; this is known as \u2018synaptic plasticity\u2019 . In this way , long-term information about learning and memory can be stored and used to direct future responses to similar situations . Many proteins are involved in forming and altering synapses . The genes that code for these proteins are found in the nucleus of the neuron within the cell body . To make new proteins , copies of genes are made using molecules called mRNAs , which then leave the nucleus and are used as templates by the machinery that assemble proteins . Previous studies have shown that mRNA molecules are transported from the cell body to the axon and dendrites , but it is not clear exactly where the proteins are produced . Kim et al . have now studied the movement of mRNAs in neurons from the sea slug Aplysia during synapse formation and synapse plasticity . This showed that mRNAs are delivered equally throughout the neuron , and so it appears that mRNAs are not targeted to a particular synapse . However , the level of protein production using these mRNA molecules is much higher in places where synapses are being formed or altered . A protein called netrin-1 promotes protein production in the dendrites of neurons at these synapses . Kim et al . demonstrate that although mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuron , they are only used to make proteins at specific synapses . This allows the entire neuron to be in a state of readiness to make new synapses or alter existing ones in response to stimuli from the environment . Understanding more about how this local control of protein production works within neurons may provide new insights into diseases that affect synaptic plasticity .",
        "first_gen": "Neurons are highly polarized and compartmentalized cells that extend long distances and form thousands of connections with other neurons. These connections require new molecules called RNA molecules, which are made from proteins called messenger RNAs ( mRNAs for short ), and proteins ( proteins ) that bind to the mRNA molecules. When a neuron is paired with a motor neuron, it undergoes a process called synapse formation and plasticity. This process involves a series of changes in the structure and function of the neuron. For example, the activity of a protein called serotonin triggers the translation of mRNA from the nucleus to stimulated synapses. Previous studies have shown that this process is regulated by a signaling molecule called the netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. However, these studies did not show that the production of these molecules was restricted to specific locations within the cell. To address this question, Lyles et al. used a technique called fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) to study the localization of RNA in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons in cultured mice. The experiments showed that mRNA was delivered throughout the neurons, but only at sites of contact and/or synaptic stimulation. In contrast, when neurons were paired to motor neurons they were more likely to be able to respond to a signal from a nearby neuron than to receive it from their nucleus. Further experiments revealed that in addition to regulating mRNA translation, local RNA is also required to make proteins that are needed for the formation of new connections between neurons and other brain cells. Furthermore, this suggests that local mRNA is required for long-term synaptic formation."

These patterns of cells give rise to the different tissues and organs that make up the body . Although we often use \u2018model\u2019 organisms such as mice and frogs to study how embryos develop , our species has evolved unique ways to control organ development . Investigating these processes is difficult: we cannot experiment on human embryos , and our development is hard to recreate in test tubes . As a result , we do not fully understand how developing human cells specialize and organize . Libby et al . have now created a new system to study how different genes control cell organization . The system uses human pluripotent stem cells \u2013 cells that have the ability to specialize into any type of cell . Some of the stem cells are modified using a technique called inducible CRISPR interference , which makes it possible to reduce the activity of certain genes in these cells . Libby et al . used this technique to investigate how changes to the activity of two genes \u2013 called ROCK1 and CDH1 \u2013 affect how a mixed group of stem cells organized themselves . Cells that lacked ROCK1 formed bands near the edges of the group . Cells that lacked CDH1 segregated themselves from other cells , forming \u2018islands\u2019 inside the main group . The cells retained their ability to specialize into any type of cell after forming these patterns . However , specific groups of cells were more likely to become certain cell types . The method developed by Libby et al . can be used to study a range of complex tissue development and cell organization processes .

        "first_gen": "Morphogenesis is a process in which the cells of the body are organized into distinct groups of cells. This process is known as asymmetric emergence, and it is the hallmark of morphogenesis. Morphous cells are able to self-organize into tissue-like structures, such as optic cups, gut organoids, or other organs. However, it remains unclear how this asymmetry-breaking process occurs. To investigate this question, Mandegar et al. genetically engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) to produce a variety of different types of stem cell. These cells were then genetically modified to form two distinct populations, one of which is called a \u201cmolecular knockdown\u201d. When the two populations were genetically edited, these cells became more symmetric, while the other group was less symmetrical. The experiments show that a protein called ROCK1 and CDH1, which regulate cell-cell interactions, can be selectively perturbed in response to CRISPR interference. In addition, the researchers found that these two proteins were less active in the mutant cells than in normal cells, suggesting that they were more likely to behave in a similar way to embryonic development. Further experiments showed that this effect was due to the presence of a molecular regulator of cortical tension and cell adhesion, a molecule that helps cells to communicate with each other and to coordinate their behavior. Moreover, when the cell\u2019s genes were switched on or off, this reduced the number of genes that control how cells behave, leading to a pattern of asymmetrical formation. Overall, using the techniques used in this study to study the asymmetries that occur in human embryos revealed that the differences in cell behavior were not caused by a single gene, but rather by changes in gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with the observed pattern. Understanding how these differences occur could help researchers to design new organs and tissues."

This system temporarily stores information relevant to whatever task you are currently performing . However , the more items you try to hold in working memory at once , the poorer the quality of each of the resulting memories . It has long been argued that this phenomenon \u2013 known as the set size effect \u2013 occurs because the brain devotes a fixed amount of neural resources to working memory . But this theory struggles to account for certain experimental results . It also fails to explain why the brain would not simply recruit more resources whenever it has more items to remember . After all , your heart does something similar by beating faster whenever you increase your physical activity . Van den Berg and Ma break with the idea that working memory resources are fixed . They propose that resource allocation is flexible and driven by two conflicting goals: maximize memory performance , but use as few neural resources as necessary . Indeed , a computer simulation that follows this strategy mimics the set size effects seen in healthy volunteers . In the model , the items most relevant for a task are stored more accurately than less important ones , a phenomenon also observed in participants . Lastly , the simulation predicts that the total amount of resources devoted to working memory will vary with the number of items to be remembered . This too is consistent with the results of previous experiments . Working memory thus appears to be more flexible than previously thought . The amount of resources that the brain allocates to working memory is not fixed but could be the result of balancing resource cost against cognitive performance . If this is confirmed , it may be possible to improve working memory by offering rewards , or by increasing the perceived importance of a task .",
        "first_gen": "Visual working memory decreases with the number of items in memory. This is because the amount of information stored in the memory of an individual is reduced with each item encoded. However, it is not clear how the brain minimizes this effect. To investigate this question, Emrich et al. used a mathematical model to test the theory against data from nine delayed-estimation experiments. The model showed that the human brain maximizes a weighted sum of both an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. In the experiments, the observer holds a set of objects in a memory and then reports their estimate of a randomly probed target item. These estimates are then compared to the expected value of the information encoded by the item, which is then measured by probing probability. As a result, these estimates can vary between the items encoded with a given value and those that are not. It is also possible that this process is driven by external incentives, such as the fact that a person is rewarded for performing well on a task that is independent of their performance. Furthermore, this model predicts that cognitive \"limitations\" arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints."

This process is known as autophagy and it involves engulfing cellular material inside spherical structures called autophagosomes , before delivering it to sites in the cell where digestive enzymes can break the material down . A form of autophagy , known as selective autophagy , can specifically degrade toxic substances such as disease-causing microbes . Selective autophagy works through proteins called autophagy cargo receptors that define which molecules are targeted for degradation . However , it was not clear whether autophagy protects plants from infections , or how much disease-causing microbes interfere with this process for their own benefit . The microbe that causes late blight of potatoes ( called Phytophthora infestans ) is infamous for triggering widespread famines in Ireland in the 19th century . This disease-causing microbe continues to pose a serious threat to food security today , and parasitizes plant tissues by releasing proteins called effectors that enter the plant\u2019s cells to subvert the plant\u2019s physiology and counteract its defenses . Dagdas , Belhaj et al . now report that an effector from P . infestans , called PexRD54 , can bind to autophagy-related protein from potato , called ATG8CL , and stimulate the formation of autophagosomes . Further experiments revealed that the PexRD54 effector could outcompete a plant autophagy cargo receptor that would otherwise bind to ATG8CL . This plant cargo receptor contributes to the plant\u2019s defences , and by preventing it from interacting with ATG8CL , PexRD54 makes the plant more susceptible to infection by P . infestans . These findings show that the PexRD54 effector has evolved to interact with an autophagy-related protein to counteract the plant\u2019s defences . Dagdas , Belhaj et al . suggest that PexRD54 might do this by activating autophagy to selectively eliminate some of the molecules that the plant use to defend itself . Furthermore , P . infestans might also benefit from the nutrients that are released when cellular material is broken down via autophagy . Future work could test these two hypotheses and explore whether other effectors from disease-causing microbes work in a similar way .",

This process is controlled by a group of proteins known as cargo receptors, which bind to a specific type of cargo receptor. When a plant is deprived of nutrients, it releases a protein called ATG8CL into the cell\u2019s lytic compartment, where it stores the nutrients it needs to survive. In the potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans, an effector called PexRD54, is able to detect and remove unwanted cargo from plant cells. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that regulate this process are not fully understood. Stolz et al. have now investigated how a bacterium that causes a crop loss in the Irish potato famine can interfere with the process. The experiments show that the plant pathogens use a mechanism called a \u201ccatabolic pathway\u201d that binds to an enzyme called Joka2, a receptor for the protein that is responsible for triggering the activation of this pathway. Further experiments showed that this mechanism works by inhibiting the activity of a gene that encodes the gene for another protein, called AIM2. Together, these findings suggest that plant pathogens have evolved a new way to interact with and subvert the production of these proteins."

This response is part of the normal repair process , but it can lead to the formation of scar tissue in non-damaged areas of the heart . Excess scar tissue makes the heart muscle less able to contract and increases the affected individual\u2019s chance of dying . Understanding how this repair process works is an important step in developing strategies to minimise the damage caused by coronary artery disease or heart attacks .

The improvements mean the device could also recreate other conditions seen early on in damaged heart tissue , specifically the reduced supply of oxygen . Replicating combinations of mechanical changes and oxygen supplies meant that the impact of these conditions on human cardiac fibroblasts could be directly observed in the laboratory for the first time . Ugolini et al . found that a lack of contraction and low oxygen levels triggered the cardiac fibroblasts to produce inflammatory molecules and molecules associated with the formation of scar tissue . This resembles the response seen in living hearts . The next step is to improve the lab-on-chip device further by adding other cell types , including heart muscle cells and immune cells .

When a heart attack or stroke occurs, the myocardium becomes inflamed, which leads to the death of contractile cardiac myocytes. This process is triggered by a series of environmental cues, including changes in the amount of oxygen and nutrients that flow into the body. In the first few hours of an injury, these changes can trigger a cascade of cellular responses. For example, when a person\u2019s heart starts to contract, their blood pressure drops, and their oxygen levels drop. However, it is not clear how these early changes are triggered. Ugolini et al. have now developed a new microdevice that can be used to control the levels of different environmental stimuli. The device was developed to simulate the effects of mechanical stress on the cells that produce extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ), but it was not possible to precisely predict how the cell responses to these stimuli would be triggered in real-time. To address this problem, they used a technique called cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension to modify the activity of a small group of cells in a blood vessel called the Myocardial Infarction Center ( or CFIC for short ). These experiments show that the CFs respond to both mechanical and oxygen stress by responding to different combinations of these conditions. Further experiments showed that these responses are similar to those seen in patients suffering from ischemic heart disease, in which the blood vessels contract and the tissue is damaged. Furthermore, a combination of two different types of stress, called hypoxia and 2% strain, was able to trigger the activation of CF cells. Unexpectedly, this was also the case for patients who had been exposed to an oxygen-deprived environment and were unable to detect the changes that occurred when the stress was applied to their heart cells, suggesting that this may be due to a lack of understanding of early environmental changes."

Often these proteins work together in groups called complexes . In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , one of these complexes is called DOMINO . The DOMINO complex alters gene activity by interacting with other proteins called histones which influence how the genes are packaged and accessed within the cell . DOMINO works in two separate ways . First , it can replace certain histones with other variants that regulate genes differently . Second , it can modify histones by adding a chemical marker to them , which alters how they interact with genes . It was not clear how DOMINO can do both of these things and how that is controlled; but it was known that cells can make two different forms of the central component of the complex , called DOM-A and DOM-B , which are both encoded by the same gene . Scacchetti et al . have now studied fruit flies to understand the activities of these forms . This revealed that they do have different roles and that gene activity in cells changes if either one is lost . The two forms operate as part complexes with different compositions and only DOM-A includes the TIP60 enzyme that is needed to modify histones . As such , it seems that DOM-B primarily replaces histones with variant forms , while DOM-A modifies existing histones . This means that each form has a unique role associated with each of the two known behaviors of this complex . The presence of two different DOMINO complexes is common to flies and , probably , other insects . Yet , in other living things , such as mammals and yeast , their two roles are carried out by protein complexes originating from two distinct genes . This illustrates a concept called convergent evolution , where different organisms find different solutions for the same problem . As such , these findings provide an insight into the challenges encountered through evolution and the diverse solutions that have developed . They will also help us to understand the ways in which protein activities can adapt to different needs over evolutionary time .",

To investigate this question, Baldi et al. used a technique called CRISPR/Cas9 to identify two different versions of the enzyme called DOMINO chromatin remodeling ATPase. The experiments revealed that the enzymes that remodel the DNA are involved in a process called histone acetyltransferase ( or DOMIN for short ). Both enzymes work in the same way, but in different ways. In yeast and humans, both enzymes are required to make histones, whereas in Drosophila melanogaster, only one enzyme is required: the SWR1 complex. It is not known how this enzyme works, or how it interacts with other enzymes, such as enzymes. Further experiments showed that two other proteins, known as DOMA and DOM-B, are needed for both activities. These proteins were also found in yeast cells and in flies. This suggests that these two enzymes may interact via different mechanisms. Furthermore, the experiments show that, in contrast to the yeast enzyme, these enzymes do not work together. Instead, they interact in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to how yeast enzymes and enzymes interact. Together these findings provide an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional diversity."

Beta-catenin in the muscle is known to regulate motor nerve development . However , beta-catenin has two different roles: it helps to coordinate whether neighboring cells stick together , and it can regulate which genes are \u2018transcribed\u2019 to produce proteins .

In the experiments, the mutant mice were genetically engineered to produce a mutant version of \u0394tAD that was unable to distinguish between the two types of mice. These mice also had a mutation that caused them to lose the ability to differentiate into motor neurons. Further experiments revealed that the gene for \u0394 TAD is needed to regulate the differentiation of neurons, but it was not clear whether this gene is also needed for a retrograde role. Wu and co-workers also found that a mutated mutant mutant that lacked the transactivation domain was able to induce synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants. Together, these findings suggest that \u0394CtAD plays a key role in activating the cell-adhesion pathway that regulates nerve cell differentiation."

Epithelial tissue is one of the four basic types of tissue found in animals , and it occurs in almost every organ in the body . For example , epithelial tissue makes up the outermost layer of the skin , and the lining of the lungs and the intestines; the cells in epithelial tissues are attached to one another via \u2018adhesion molecules\u2019 . Organs and tissues need to be maintained throughout life in order for them to work properly . Epithelial cells in particular are very short-lived and must be constantly replaced . If epithelial tissue is cut or damaged in any way , the surrounding healthy epithelial cells must work together to repair the wound and restore the tissue's integrity . These processes require individual epithelial cells to communicate with one another . While chemical signals provide one means of cell-to-cell communication , cells also sense and respond to the physical presence of surrounding cells . In adults , organs and tissues generally do not change shape or size; as such there is a tightly balanced exchange of mechanical forces between the individual cells . Damage to the tissue causes a detectable change in these mechanical forces , which is sensed by nearby healthy epithelial cells and causes them to work towards healing the wound . While the importance of mechanical forces in maintaining tissue integrity is widely recognized , there were few tools to study these forces; this meant that mechanical communication through cell\u2013cell adhesion sites was not well understood . Now Ng , Besser et al . describe the development and use of a new method for measuring and mapping the exchange of mechanical forces at cell\u2013cell adhesion sites . Changes in the strength of the forces exchanged between cells could be measured across clusters of multiple cells or for specific parts of individual cells . Ng , Besser et al . found that when an epithelial cell in a cluster started to divide to form two new cells , the cell exerted less mechanical force on its neighboring cells . Ng , Besser et al . found that the forces exerted between cells were strongest when there was more of an adhesion molecule called E-cadherin in the cell surface membrane at the cell\u2013cell adhesion sites .

For example, when a tissue undergoes a change in its shape, the forces exerted by a cell on the surface of the tissue can be balanced by forces from the surrounding tissue. However, it is not clear how these forces are balanced between cells and their neighbors. To address this question, Tseng et al. used a technique called high-resolution traction force microscopy ( or TFM ) to study the dynamics of force exchange at cell-cell junctions. The experiments showed that the force exchanged between the cell and its neighbors depended on how tightly the two cells interacted with each other. This revealed that, at the level of a single cell, there was a balance between force and actomyosin contractility at each juncture. In the case of two or more cells, each cell had to balance the amount of forces that it was exerting on its neighboring cell. These forces were then coupled to changes in the position of another cell within the cluster, which allowed the other cell to adjust its position to the strength of its surroundings. Further experiments found that this balance was controlled by the activity of other cells in a cluster of cells that were in mechanical equilibrium with one another, and that these cells were able to maintain the balance of their forces on their neighboring cells even when they were divided or rearranged. TGF-rays were used to measure the mechanical interactions between two different types of epithelial cells at different points in time, using a method called the finite element method ( FEM ). It was also possible to use this technique to identify the molecular mechanisms that control the movement of cell\u2013cell forces in tissues.

Normally , the protein has a section near its tail end made up of the amino acid glutamine repeated around 23 times . Mutations that increase the number of glutamines to more than 38 cause Huntington\u2019s disease . The more extra glutamines there are in this region of the protein , the earlier in life the disease symptoms begin . But it was not clear how these extra glutamines near the tail of huntingtin affect the structure and behavior of a protein that is more than 3 , 000 amino acids long . Now , Vijayvargia et al . have revealed why the tail end of huntingtin is so important . Several biophysical methods were used to determine the three-dimensional structure of the huntingtin protein . These methods revealed that the protein folds up into a hollow sphere and that its tail end is able to interact with the entire length of the protein and physically touches its opposite end . To see this in more detail , Vijayvargia et al . used another experimental technique called crosslinking mass spectrometry to confirm which parts of the huntingtin protein are in close contact with each other . Together with the structural data , these experiments suggest that the stretch of glutamines is in the position to bring about subtle , but widespread , changes throughout the huntingtin protein .

However , iron can also trigger the formation of harmful molecules that can damage cells . It is therefore crucial that the amount of iron in cells is tightly controlled and that any extra iron is safely stored away . Most of the iron in the body is stored within a protein called ferritin , which is then broken down to release iron as it is needed , in a process known as ferritinophagy . Cells use several systems to break down proteins , one of which , called autophagy , has been linked to ferritinophagy . During autophagy , a bubble-like structure called an autophagosome engulfs proteins that need to be removed and delivers them to a compartment in the cell where they can be broken down . In 2014 , researchers showed that a protein called NCOA4 on the surface of autophagosomes targets ferritin for destruction . When iron levels are high in the cell , the amount of NCOA4 on the autophagosomes is low . This leads to fewer ferritin molecules being broken down . In contrast , low iron levels lead to an increase of NCOA4 on autophagosomes , which promotes ferritinophagy and increases the amount of iron in the cell . Now , Mancias , Vaites et al\u2014including several of the researchers involved in the 2014 work\u2014investigate the role of NCOA4 in ferritinophagy in more detail . Biochemical experiments revealed that a region of NCOA4 directly interacts with a particular subunit of ferritin and this interaction is necessary to deliver ferritin to autophagosomes . Mancias , Vaites et al . then used laboratory grown-cells to investigate why the amount of NCOA4 changes in response to the amount of iron in the cell . The experiments show the amount of NCOA4 varies depending on whether it interacts with another protein called HERC2 , which targets proteins for destruction by a structure called the proteasome . HERC2 only binds to NCOA4 when iron levels are high , which leads to NCOA4 being broken down by the proteasome . When iron levels are low , HERC2 does not interact with NCOA4 . The presence of more NCOA4 then leads to more ferritinophagy , and so increases the amount of iron in the cell . Mancias , Vaites et al . also found that red blood cells , which depend highly on iron , do not develop properly in zebrafish that have lower amounts of the NCOA4 protein . Further work is needed to see whether NCOA4 is also important for the development of other cells and tissues .",

To find out, Mancias, Dowdle et al. used a technique called biochemical and cell culture to study the role of a receptor called HERC2 in regulating iron metabolism. The experiments showed that the receptor binds ferretin to an enzyme called FTH1, but not FTL. In addition, the protein was also found to bind to a molecule called ubiquitin. Further experiments revealed that this protein is involved in a process called autophagy, in which iron is released from a cell into a compartment called the lysosome, where it stores up to 4500 iron atoms. These experiments show that a region of the enzyme known as the Herc2-FTL ligase interacts with a key surface arginine that is present in FHT1 and a C-terminal element that binds FTR1. Together, these two proteins are able to regulate the activity of ferriticin in cells, and they are important for controlling the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in animals and humans. Future work will be needed to understand how these processes are controlled."

Individuals with damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex are disorganized and easily distracted , and may show behaviors that are inappropriate for their context . However , the involvement of the lateral prefrontal cortex in such a wide range of processes makes it difficult to study . This in turn presents a significant roadblock to a full understanding of cognition and human intelligence . Of particular interest is whether the lateral prefrontal cortex has a hierarchical organization wherein a region coordinates the roles of other regions , much like the chief executive of a company . Therefore , Nee and D\u2019Esposito set out to map how the lateral prefrontal cortex is organized , and how its different regions communicate with each other to support complex cognition . Brain imaging revealed that the rear ( posterior ) part of the lateral prefrontal cortex processes an individual\u2019s current situation , while the front ( anterior ) prepares for future situations . Areas in the middle process both types of information . These central areas appear to be highly influential as they have stronger connections to the anterior and posterior regions than vice versa . In cognitively demanding situations , the middle areas receive input from both anterior regions ( potentially about future needs ) and posterior regions ( potentially about current needs ) . By combining the two sets of information , the middle areas can select behaviors that take into account both present circumstances and longer-term goals . With this strategic overview , the middle areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex are well positioned to play the part of the brain\u2019s chief executive . Future experiments should test whether the interactions observed between the different regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex are essential for complex planning and thinking . Additional work in animals would improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these interactions . Finally , studying how these interactions are altered in disorders such as schizophrenia , where the lateral prefrontal cortex shows abnormal activity , might pave the way for more effective treatments .",

While rodents have a smooth cortical surface , the cortex of larger mammals such as primates is organized into folds and furrows . These folds increase the amount of cortex that can fit inside the confines of the skull , and are thought to have allowed the evolution of more advanced thought processes . Mutations in various genes are likely to have contributed to the expansion and folding of the cortex . These mutations may not always have involved changes in the instructions encoded within the genes , but might instead have involved changes in the number of copies of a gene . One plausible candidate gene is TBC1D3 , which is only found in the great apes and is active in the cortex . The chimpanzee genome contains a single copy of TBC1D3 whereas the human genome contains multiple copies . Ju , Hou et al . have now shown that introducing the TBC1D3 gene into mouse embryos triggers changes in the embryonic cortex . Specifically , this gene increases the number of a type of cell called the outer radial glial cell in the cortex . These cells give rise to new neurons , and are usually rare in mice but abundant in the brains of animals with a folded cortex . Additional experiments using samples of human brain tissue confirmed that TBC1D3 is required for the outer radial glial cells to form . The samples were collected from miscarried fetuses with the informed consent of the patients and following approved protocols and ethical guidelines . Finally , introducing the TBC1D3 gene into the mouse genome also gave rise to animals with a folded cortex , rather than their usual smooth brain surface . Further work is now required to identify how TBC1D3 helps to generate outer radial glial cells , and to work out how these cells cause the cortex to expand . Testing the behavior of mice with the TBC1D3 gene could also uncover the links between cortical folding and thought processes .",

The expansion of the human brain correlates with the increase in intelligence, but the mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly understood. For example, a gene called TBC1D3 is found in the mouse brain, and it is thought that this gene contributes to cortical expansion. However, it was not clear how the gene is involved in this process. Now, Florio et al. have used a technique called reverse transcription PCR to study the role of a specific gene that is expressed in human and non-human brain cells. This revealed that the genes that are expressed on the surface of human brains are duplicated in a way that causes the cells to be folded in different ways. In the experiments, mice were exposed to electroporation, which increased the number of cells in their brains and caused them to divide into two groups: the outer and intermediate progenitors ( or IPs for short ). These cells were also more likely to fold than those that were found on mouse brains. Moreover, the expression of another gene in mice that was found to have a similar role in cortical folding was also higher than in other species of primates and mammals, suggesting that it may be important for the growth of cortical folds in humans and other animals."

Over time , plants have developed various mechanisms for fighting off infections caused by pests and other pathogens such as viruses and bacteria . When plants become infected they kick their immune system into action by rapidly switching on and off certain genes . They do this by activating the protein NPR1 which regulates the plant\u2019s immune genes . NPR1 is essential for fighting off infections and plants that do not have this protein are highly susceptible to disease . Peculiarly , once the plant has detected an infection it builds resistance by destroying the NPR1 protein . A previous study suggested that plants do this to replace old \u2018inactive\u2019 NPR1 with newer versions that can activate the genes needed to stop the disease developing . This process , however , requires a lot of energy that could be re-directed to other aspects of the immune response . Now , Skelly et al . \u2013 including one of the researchers involved in the previous study \u2013 have explored whether there may be other reasons for why plants destroy the NPR1 protein . Plant cells target NPR1 for destruction by repeatedly tagging it with molecules called ubiquitin to form ubiquitin chains . The length of these chains determines whether a protein is stable and ready for action , or whether it is ready to be destroyed . In experiments with a commonly studied plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana , Skelly et al . found that the length of ubiquitin chains attached to the NPR1 protein could fine-tune its level of activity: short ubiquitin chains activate NPR1 , while longer chains lead to its destruction and shut down the protein . This suggests that the steps leading to the destruction of NPR1 regulate the immune genes needed to fight off disease . This work has uncovered important new components of how plants defend themselves from infection . If these findings translate to crop plants they could inform future agricultural strategies for enhancing the plant\u2019s own defences to increase crop yields , which would provide more food for a rapidly growing population .",

To do this, the immune cells must reprogram themselves so that they are able to detect and respond to pathogens. This process is known as \u2018reprogramming\u2019. In plants, a protein called the transcriptional coactivator NPR1 is active in the nucleus of the plant. However, it is not clear how this process works. Spoel, Dong et al. have now investigated if the activity of this protein is controlled by other proteins. The experiments show that the protein interacts with a group of enzymes called E3 and E4 ligases, which are responsible for the production of proteins that are essential for plant immunity. These enzymes are also involved in a process called ubiquitination, in which the proteins are removed from the cell nucleus and replaced with another protein, called CRL3. UBE4 is thought to play a key role in boosting the levels of NPR proteins in plant cells, but it was not known if it also plays a similar role when the proteasome is switched on, or if this is the case in other eukaryotes, such as yeast and humans. It was also unclear whether the enzymes that remove the NPR protein from cells also play the same role, and if so, if they do so in plants."

The addition of small chemical tags called methyl groups to DNA is one of the many ways by which cells can influence gene activity . These methyl groups can silence genes by altering the DNA so that is more tightly packed within the nucleus of the cell . Virus genes and mobile sections of DNA called transposable elements ( sometimes known as jumping genes ) are also silenced by DNA methylation to keep them from doing harm . In plants , methyl groups can be attached to DNA by proteins that are guided to the DNA by molecules called short interfering ribonucleic acids ( or siRNAs for short ) . Each siRNA is made of a chain of 24 building blocks called nucleotides and is able to bind to matching RNA molecules that are attached to the target DNA . The siRNAs are made from longer RNA molecules in a process that involves trimming by an enzyme called DCL3 . However , it is not clear how long these \u201cprecursor\u201d molecules are before DCL3 cuts them down to size . Here , Blevins , Podicheti et al . studied how siRNAs are made in a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana . The experiments show that RNAs containing around 26-45 nucleotides accumulate in cells that lack DCL3 and these cells are unable to make 24 nucleotide long siRNAs . Furthermore , the purified DCL3 enzyme can cut these precursor RNAs to make the siRNAs . Because the precursors are relatively short , the experiments suggest that DCL3 only cuts each precursor RNA once when making siRNAs . Blevins , Podicheti et al . also show that the siRNA precursors are made by a partnership of two RNA synthesizing enzymes . Therefore , a challenge for the future will be to understand exactly how they work together .",

In this process, the RNA molecules that make up the genome are packaged into 24-nucleotide small interfering RNA ( siRNAs ). The RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ) and RDR2 are involved in the production of these molecules. However, it is not clear how the 24 nt siRNA molecules are made. To investigate this question, Matzke et al. used a technique called RNA blot hybridization to identify 24 nucleotide small- interfering RNas that can be produced from either end of a DNA molecule called a single-stranded RNA molecule ( dsRNA ), or from both ends of one of two different types of ribosomal RNA: one strand of DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ) or the other strand. Mutations in a gene called dcl3 can cause the gene to switch on or off, but it was not known how these changes affect the activity of other genes. Using a combination of RNA and DNA sequencing techniques and deep sequencing to investigate the role of both enzymes in DNA methylation and RNA-directed RNA biogenesis was able to reveal that both of them are responsible for producing 24, 45, and 50, nucleotide short-initiatives. These results suggest that, in addition to blocking the transcription of genes, these two enzymes also play a key role in silencing the genes that do not work properly."

Dom\u00ednguez , Ma , Yu et al . therefore set out to determine when exactly these properties began to take shape in mice , using lightweight nets of electrodes to record brain activity in sleeping newborn pups . The nets were designed to avoid disturbing the animals or damaging their fragile brains . The recordings showed that patterns of brain activity similar to those seen in adults emerged during the first couple of weeks after birth . Just before , however , the brains of the pups went through a brief period of reduced activity: this lull seemed to mark a transition from an immature to a more mature mode of operation . After this pause , neurons in the mouse brains showed coordinated patterns of firing reminiscent of those seen in adults . By monitoring the brains of human babies using scalp sensors , Dom\u00ednguez , Ma , Yu et al . showed that a similar transition also occurs in infants during their first few months of life , suggesting that brains may mature via a process retained across species .

However, it is not clear when and how neural networks develop into their mature form. For example, in humans, the spindle-like pattern of activity that appears in the first week of development is thought to be triggered by peripheral stimuli, but it has not been fully understood how these patterns develop. Now, Khodagholy et al. have used a technique called electrophysiology to study the activity patterns of neurons in mice and humans. The experiments show that neurons are organized in a series of patterns that appear intermittently at the beginning of a developmental week. These patterns are then synchronized with each other, which allows the neurons to synchronize and coordinate their activity. This synchronization is known as the \u201cspindle quiescence\u201d. In contrast, mature neurons do not appear at this time point. Instead, they appear as spindles at a later stage in development, called the second postnatal week ( P ) 5 to 14 ( n = 108 pups ). During this period, neural activity is synchronized and synchronized across different layers of the cortex. Mice with immature neurons show a similar pattern to those in adults. But this transition is characterized by a transient period in which the neural network synchronizes with the cellular and cellular networks that are involved in memory and learning. Moreover, these changes occur at different times during the development of brain cells and neurons. Understanding how this occurs could lead to new treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders."

        "ground_truth": "Malaria is an infectious disease that is estimated to kill more than half a million people every year , mostly young children in Africa . It is spread by mosquitos that are infected with Plasmodium parasites that attack red blood cells in the human body . Plasmodium falciparum , the species that is responsible for most of these deaths , causes malaria by entering red blood cells and releasing antigens that travel to the surface of the cells , where they change the adhesion properties . This causes the infected red blood cells to accumulate in small blood vessels , surface capillaries or the brain , which can have severe consequences for the person infected . P . falciparum is particularly dangerous because of its ability to vary the antigens displayed on the cell surface: this process , known as antigenic variation , helps to maintain infections for extended periods of time by allowing the antigens to stay one step ahead of the immune system ( a process known as immune escape ) . The origins of antigenic variation lie in the fact that each P . falciparum genome has a repertoire of between 50 and 60 var genes that code for the variability of a major antigen that is responsible for immune escape in malaria . Molecular sequencing has shown that local parasite populations contain thousands of different types of var genes: hence , meiotic recombination in the mosquito can create a vast number of combinations of var repertoires . Artzy-Randrup et al . have developed a computational model of this highly diverse and complex system to address the following question: is a local pathogen population composed of largely random and ephemeral repertoires of these genes , or is it structured into independently circulating strains ? Their model goes beyond previous models by including interactions within the local host population that arise as a result of indirect competition between different strains of the pathogen for available hosts: this competition is influenced by the history of infection and , therefore , by the patterns of immunity within the host population . Previous models included within-host processes but not these higher , local population-level interactions . The model simulates the dynamics of all the unique combinations of var genes in a population of hosts , and shows that even with high rates of reproduction , the parasite population self-organizes into a limited number of coexisting strains: the distinct var repertoires of these strains only weakly overlap , suggesting that the immune response of the host population has been partitioned into distinct niches . By investigating genetic variation at both antigenic sites and regions of the genome that do not code for antigens , Artzy-Randrup et al . suggest that immune selection\u2014the selection imposed on var repertoires by the build up of specific immunity at the population level\u2014plays a central role in structuring parasite diversity . The new model should lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology of Plasmodium and other pathogens that work in similar ways , including Trypanosoma brucei ( sleeping sickness ) , Borellia burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ) and Giardia lamblia ( gastroenteritis ) , and help with global efforts to eliminate malaria and other diseases .",

The parasite\u2019s genome is composed of more than 60 different genes, each of which is unique to each individual host. However, it is not clear how this diversity of genes is maintained. To investigate this question, Tibayrenc et al. developed a mathematical model that simulates the dynamics of the parasite population in a large population of hosts. In the model, the parasites are exposed to a wide range of different viral and bacterial pathogens, and then recombine to produce new versions of their genes. This process is known as \u2018strain theory\u201d, but it has been difficult to test it empirically because of its complexity and complexity. These results show that a single parasite genome contains up to 60 genes that undergo recombination, which allows it to evade the host immune response and establish a chronic infection. Further experiments showed that, even under high levels of genetic variation, a small number of single-copy genes can be produced and recombinated to create new copies of each gene. Furthermore, many of these genes are present at the same time in different host populations, making it possible for a parasite to escape the immune system and evade detection. Many pathogen populations seem to have many different types of viral, bacterial and bacteriophage. It is therefore important to understand how parasite populations evolve and evolve."

There is currently no vaccine to protect against the disease , and some strains are also now resistant to antibiotics . People get infected by eating or drinking contaminated foods and water . After passing through the stomach , Shigella invades and then multiplies in the lining of the intestine , eventually causing tissue damage and irritation . During this process , Shigella \u2018hides\u2019 from its host\u2019s immune system by blocking how intestinal cells respond to infection . Normally , infected cells send out chemical signals that act like a call for help , attracting specialised immune cells to clear the infection . In intestinal cells , two proteins called UBC13 and TRAF6 work together to switch on this response . Specifically , TRAF6 needs to bind to UBC13 for the switch to turn on . Like many proteins , UBC13 is formed of thousands of atoms; some of these are organized in \u2018functional groups\u2019 , a collection of atoms joined in a specific manner and with special chemical properties . During Shigella infection , the bacteria produce an enzyme that changes a single functional group ( an amino group ) at a specific location within UBC13 for a different one ( an hydroxyl group ) . Previous research showed that this could stop the immune response in intestinal cells , but the mechanism remained unknown . Mohanty et al . therefore set out to determine exactly how a change of so few atoms could have such a dramatic effect . Biochemical studies using purified proteins revealed that Shigella\u2019s alteration to UBC13 did not change its overall structure . However , the altered protein could no longer bind to its partner TRAF6 . Theoretical analysis and computer simulations revealed that the normal binding process relies on a positively charged amino acid ( one of the protein\u2019s building blocks ) in UBC13 and a negatively charged one in TRAF6 being attracted to each other . Shigella\u2019s substitution , however , introduces a second negatively charged amino acid in UBC13 . This \u2018steals\u2019 the positively charged amino acid that would normally interact with TRAF6: the electrical attraction between the two proteins is disrupted , and this stops them from binding . The work by Mohanty et al . reveals the exact mechanism Shigella uses to dampen its host\u2019s immune response during infection . In the future , this knowledge could be used to develop more effective drugs that would help control outbreaks of diarrhoea .",

When a bacterium enters the body, it activates a signaling pathway known as Nf-\u03baB signaling. This pathway is activated by a protein called UBC13, and it converts it to glutamate ( Q100E ). However, when the bacteria enter the cell, the ubiquitins bind to a residue in the protein that binds to the glutamate residue. In the first steps of this process, a glutamine residue is attached to an amino group called a glycine residue, but the amino groups are not anchored to each other. Shigella flexneri is an enteric bacteria that is known to cause inflammation in its host cells. The bacteria use a process called post-translational modification to alter the structure of these proteins. To do this, they add a molecule called TRAF6RING to their DNA. These proteins interact with one another by attaching a salt-bridge at the end of their chains to form a complex. Now, Middleton et al. show that deamidation weakens the interaction between the two proteins and prevents them from interacting with the same molecule. Further experiments showed that the de-amidase deactivates the binding of TRAFs6 RING by disrupting the intermolecular interactions between these two protein-protein complexes. Unexpectedly, these interactions prevented the proteins from working together to create a new complex that could be used as a defense mechanism against pathogen invasion. Furthermore, this new structure prevents the activity of other proteins that are involved in this complex from interfering with it. Future work will be needed to understand how this modification works and to find out if it is also used in other signaling pathways."

A common assumption is that we can work out the role of each type of neuron by increasing or decreasing its activity experimentally and observing the consequences . Imagine , for example , that increasing the activity of a group of neurons boosts the formation of memories , whereas decreasing their activity has the opposite effect . Can we conclude that the natural role of those neurons is to support memory formation ? This question has become increasingly pertinent in recent years , as advances in molecular genetic techniques such as optogenetics have made it easier to experimentally manipulate the activity of neurons . However , the ease with which these experiments can be done masks how difficult it can be to interpret the results . To test the assumption that dialing a neuron\u2019s activity up or down provides a straightforward readout of its role in the brain , Phillips and Hasenstaub used optogenetics to inactivate two types of neurons in an area of the mouse brain responsible for processing sound . Inactivating each cell type produced different outcomes . The standard way of interpreting these results is to conclude that the neurons must therefore have different , separable roles . However , using optogenetics to increase the activity of the neurons revealed no such differences in the neurons\u2019 roles . Using a computer model , Phillips and Hasenstaub showed that relatively small changes in factors such as the spontaneous activity of the neurons can affect the outcome of the experiments . Under certain circumstances , the two types of neurons respond in the same way to activation and inactivation; under other circumstances , they respond differently . The results presented by Phillips and Hasenstaub remind us that the conclusions we draw about a neuron\u2019s role can be sensitive to how the cell was manipulated .

Previous research has shown that the activity of one type of neuron \u2013 called somatostatin-positive or parvalbumin-negative \u2013 controls the speed at which the same neuron can respond to a stimulus. However, it was not clear how these neurons perform their roles. Now, Adesnik et al. have used a technique called optogenetics to investigate this question. The experiments involved manipulating the firing rate of two neurons in an auditory cortex of awake mice. Stimulating the neurons with a light-on or off light caused them to fire down or up, while inactivating the cells that normally support this activity weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. When the mice were awake, they were able to hear the tone of their own voice, but they could not distinguish between the tones that they heard. This suggests that these differences in activity may be due to the way in which each neuron controls its own activity. In the future, the results of these experiments could be used to develop new strategies to study the role of different neurons within the cortex."

Rhythmic waves of electrical activity in the brain are considered to be essential to maintain the flow of information . These brain waves occur when many brain cells repeatedly send signals at the same time , and the precise \u2018beat\u2019 of the signals might be especially important when performing more complex tasks . In recent years , cheap and safe electrical stimulation has shown promise in being able to influence brain waves .

When these regions were stimulated with the same \u2018beat\u2019 to make the brain waves more synchronized , the person performed better in the more difficult tasks .

To investigate this question, Fries et al. used a technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation ( or tACS for short ) to stimulate a brain region called the frontoparietal network that supports WM. The activity of this region was measured using a combination of fMRI and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( FMRI ). This revealed that when a task was high, participants were more likely to perform better when their brain activity was low compared to when they performed a simple choice reaction task. Further experiments showed that the same type of stimulation was also applied to the back of a person\u2019s brain during the choice response task, which increased their performance when cognitive demands were high. In contrast, the opposite effect was seen when participants performed tasks that were low in activity. These results suggest that a process called \u201csynchronous\u201d stimulation is necessary to synchronize the activity in this network. Future studies are needed to investigate whether this synchronous activity is also important for the coordination of long-range cognitive processes."

Genes that are active in the region of the embryo that will express cVg1 later in development were identified , both in normal embryos and during the process of experimental twinning . This search revealed Pitx2 as a protein that acts to switch on the expression of the gene that encodes cVg1 . When the Pitx2 protein is removed , the embryonic axis forms from the opposite side . Next , Torlopp , Khan et al . searched the chicken genome to identify stretches of DNA around the cVg1 gene where proteins that regulate gene expression might bind . Six potential sites were found , including four to which Pitx2 can bind . Further experiments confirmed that two of these regulatory sequences encourage the expression of the cVg1 gene at its correct position in the embryo . Pitx2 and related proteins were known to be involved with the development of left\u2013right symmetry later in development; the findings of Torlopp , Khan et al . reveal , unexpectedly , that these proteins are also involved in first establishing the position at which the midline of the embryo will arise .

They found that a transcription factor called Pitx2 plays an important role, and that it regulates the expression of other genes. Further experiments showed that the genes involved in forming twins in chick embryos were also involved. These findings suggest that this mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution."

        "ground_truth": "Fruit flies are attracted to the smell of rotting fruit , and use it to guide them to nearby food sources . However , this task is made more challenging by the fact that the distribution of scent or odor molecules in the air is constantly changing . Fruit flies therefore need to cope with , and exploit , this variation if they are to use odors as cues . Odor molecules bind to receptors on the surface of nerve cells called olfactory sensory neurons , and trigger nerve impulses that travel along these cells . The olfactory sensory neurons are connected to other cells called projection neurons that in turn relay information to the higher centers of the brain . While many studies have investigated how fruit flies can distinguish between different odors , less is known about how animals can use variation in the strength of an odor to guide them towards its source . Kim et al . have now addressed this question by devising a method for delivering precise quantities of odors in controlled patterns to fruit flies , and then measuring the responses of olfactory sensory neurons and projection neurons . These experiments revealed that olfactory sensory neurons\u2014which are found mainly in the flies' antennae\u2014responded most strongly whenever an odor changed rapidly in strength , and showed relatively little response to constant odors . An independent study by Schulze , Gomez-Marin et al . found that olfactory sensory neurons in fruit fly larvae also respond in a similar way . Kim et al . also found that the response of the projection neurons depended on both the rate of nerve impulses in the olfactory sensory neurons and on how quickly this rate was changing . But , unlike the olfactory sensory neurons , projection neurons showed their strongest responses immediately after an odor first appeared . Thus , in contrast to organisms such as bacteria and worms , which are highly sensitive to the local concentration gradients of odors , fruit flies instead appear to be more responsive to the sudden appearance of an odor in their environment . Kim et al . suggest that this difference may reflect the fact that for ground-based organisms , local gradients are generally reliable predictors of the location of an odor source . However , for flying insects , continually changing air currents mean that predictable local gradients are less common . Therefore , the ability to detect a hint of an odor before the wind changes is a more useful skill .",
        "first_gen": "Animals have evolved the ability to detect and respond to odor gradients in nature. For example, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors such as turning upwind in flight upon contact with an attractive odor plume, and staying within a specific odor zone. However, fruit flies with only a single functional olfactory sensory neuron ( OSN ) are capable of detecting and responding to changes in the intensity of an odor gradient. This ability is essential for animals to be able to accurately detect the variation in odor concentrations in a given environment. To do so, it is important to understand how the brain processes the signals that are sent to higher brain centers. Previous studies have used a simple method to measure the activity of the sensory neurons that connect with the projection neurons ( or OSNs ) in an early stage of development. Kim et al. used this approach to study the response of flies to a series of odor stimuli. The flies were then exposed to short plumes of a chemical called acetone, which are produced by a network of neurons in one of roughly 50 spherical compartments called the antennal lobe. These neurons then send information about the chemical\u2019s intensity and its rate of change to the lower brain center, where the information is processed by the neurons themselves. In addition, these neurons also relay information to other brain regions, including those involved in vision, audition and audition. Together these findings suggest that the neural circuits that process odor signals can be used to develop new strategies for detecting the variations in odors."

        "ground_truth": "The seeds of rice , wheat and other flowering plants store a variety of nutrients , largely in the form of sugars , proteins and oils . These stored reserves provide the main source of calories for humans and livestock all over the world , so they are of major social and economic importance . Seed development is an intricate process . It begins after male sperm cells fuse with female gametes inside the flower . This leads to the formation of the embryo , which will develop into a new plant , and a structure called the endosperm , which nourishes the growing embryo . A protective seed coat surrounds the embryo and endosperm , which develops from certain parts of the parent flower . In order for the seed to develop successfully , these three components have to communicate so they can coordinate their growth . Auxin is a key plant hormone that is needed for plants to grow and develop properly and is necessary for the endosperm to form . Previous research has shown that the endosperm is also required to trigger the formation of the seed coat , but the signal that triggers this process has not yet been identified . Figueiredo et al . now address this question in a small flowering plant called Arabidopsis thaliana . The experiments show that the endosperm produces auxin , which acts as a molecular signal for the seed coat to start forming . Exposing unfertilized flowers to auxin caused a seed coat to form even though the endosperm was absent . This suggests that this hormone alone is sufficient to trigger the formation of the seed coat without any other signals . Further analysis revealed that a protein called AGL62 regulates the movement of auxin to the parts of the flower that give rise to the seed coat . In the absence of AGL62 , the hormone remains trapped in the endosperm and the seed coat fails to develop . The next step following on from this work is to understand how auxin moves from the endosperm to the parts of the flower that form the seed coat .",
        "first_gen": "In flowering plants, fertilization is initiated by two female gametes, the egg cell and the central cell. These two fertilizing products are surrounded by a layer of tissue called the endosperm, which supports the growth of the next generation of plants. However, it is not clear how this layer is connected to the seed coat. In the fruit fly Arabidopsis thaliana, a flowering plant that is found in the United States, two male sperm cells are fused together to form a maternally derived embryo and a sperm cell, respectively. The embryo is the only component of a fertilized seed that will form the new one, while the sperm and egg cells each produce a protein called Polycomb Group ( PcG ) protein. Mutations in this protein block the production of auxin, and this block prevents the embryo from developing into a viable seed. Now, Figueiredo et al. have shown that mutant plants that lack the PCG protein are unable to develop a mature seed because they lack an enzyme called AGL62. This enzyme is known to be involved in a number of processes that control the development of seeds, but it has not been fully understood how these processes are regulated."

For instance , the T7 bacteriophage preys on various strains of Escherichia coli , a type of bacteria often found in the human gut . While many E . coli strains are inoffensive or even beneficial to human health , some can be deadly . Finding a way to kill harmful strains while sparing the helpful ones would be a helpful addition to the medicine toolkit . Bacteriophages identify and interact with their specific target through a structure known as the receptor binding protein , or RBP . However , it is still unclear exactly how RBP helps the viruses recognize which type of bacteria to infect . Here , Huss et al . set to map out and modify this structure in T7 bacteriophage so the virus is more efficient and specific about which strain of E . coli it kills . First , the role of each building block in the tip of RBP was meticulously dissected; this generated the knowledge required to genetically engineer a large number of different T7 bacteriophages , each with a slightly variation in their RBP . These viruses were then exposed to various strains of bacteria . Monitoring the bacteriophages that survived and multiplied the most after infecting different strains of E . coli revealed which RBP building blocks are important for efficiency and specificity . This was then confirmed by engineering highly active T7 bacteriophage variants against an E . coli strain that causes urinary tract infections . These findings demonstrate that even small changes to the bacteriophages can make a big difference to their ability to infect their preys . The approaches developed by Huss et al . help to understand exactly how the RBP allows a virus to infect a specific type of bacteria; this could one day pave the way for new therapies that harness those viruses to fight increasingly resistant bacterial infections .",

They are able to infect and kill bacteria and viruses, and they can be used to manipulate the immune system and other biological processes in the body. However, it is not clear how these interactions are regulated. To find out, researchers have used a technique called deep mutational scanning ( or ORACLE ) to study the activity and host range of bacteria. This technique allows researchers to examine the molecular code of a bacterial bacterium and identify which proteins are active and which are inactive. The results are then compared to the results of previous studies, which showed that many of the proteins involved in phage activity are well adapted to different hosts. In addition, the analysis revealed that some proteins that are not active on their host are more likely to be active than others. These findings suggest that the ability of bacterial phages to adapt to their hosts is a key determinant of their ability to survive and thrive in different environments. Now, Yehl et al. have developed a high-throughput method that allows them to create large, unbiased collections of variants on different bacterial species. Using this method, they genetically modified a bacteriophile called T7 to produce 1660 variants that were much more effective against resistant hosts than wildtype variants. Further experiments revealed the role of these variants in preventing the emergence of spontaneous resistance in urinary tract infections. Furthermore, these findings show that a small group of \u2018winners\u2019, such as the bacteria that infects the host, are better at controlling the spread of infections than the ones that do not. Overall, this approach provides a generalized framework for characterizing the interactions between bacterial and phagomorphs. It is also a useful tool for studying how bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics."

We vary the length of syllables , drawing out some , and shortening others . These fluctuations , known as prosody , add emotion to speech and denote punctuation . In written language , we use a comma or a period to signal a boundary between phrases . In speech , we use changes in pitch \u2013 how deep or sharp a voice sounds \u2013 or in the length of syllables . Having more than one type of cue that can signal emotion or transitions between sentences has a number of advantages . It means that people can understand each other even when factors such as background noise obscure one set of cues . It also means that people with impaired sound perception can still understand speech . Those with a condition called congenital amusia , for example , struggle to perceive pitch , but they can compensate for this difficulty by placing greater emphasis on other aspects of speech . Jasmin et al . showed how the brain achieves this by comparing the brain activities of people with and without amusia . Participants were asked to read sentences on a screen where a comma indicated a boundary between two phrases . They then heard two spoken sentences , and had to choose the one that matched the written sentence . The spoken sentences used changes in pitch and/or syllable duration to signal the position of the comma . This provided listeners with the information needed to distinguish between \"after John runs the race , . . . \" and \"after John runs , the race . . . \" , for example . When two brain regions communicate , they tend to increase their activity at around the same time . The brain regions are then said to show functional connectivity . Jasmin et al . found that compared to healthy volunteers , people with amusia showed less functional connectivity between left hemisphere brain regions that process language and right hemisphere regions that process pitch . In other words , because pitch is a less reliable source of information for people with amusia , they recruit pitch-related brain regions less when processing speech . These results add to our understanding of how brains compensate for impaired perception . This may be useful for understanding the neural basis of compensation in other clinical conditions . It could also help us design bespoke hearing aids or other communication devices , such as computer programs that convert text into speech . Such programs could tailor the pitch and rhythm characteristics of the speech they produce to suit the perception of individual users .",
        "first_gen": "In people with congenital amusia, a condition characterized by an impaired perception of and memory for pitch, it is thought that this is due to the brain\u2019s inability to distinguish between pitch and duration. However, studies have shown that individuals with the condition are more likely to rely less on pitch than those who do not have this condition. This is because they rely more on the pitch of the words they hear, rather than the duration of their speech. For example, when a person hears a sentence, they often use a longer version of that sentence to make a decision about whether the sentence is longer or shorter. In contrast, people who have amusesia rely on a shorter sentence that is shorter or longer. These findings suggest that these individuals may have a compensatory mechanism. Jasmin et al. used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to scan 15 people in the laboratory. The experiments showed that the brains of individuals who rely most on pitches in speech were less able to detect the difference between the two sentences. When the volunteers were asked to read sentences that differed only in pitch or duration, their brain activity was less reliable for them than for the controls. Further experiments revealed that when the participants were given a choice between hearing the same sentence or hearing a different one, the left and right brain regions were more connected to each other than they were to their right and left hemisphere regions. Overall, these findings show that neural connections between these regions are related to how well people can detect and remember pitch. Future studies are also needed to understand how this process works in humans and other animals."

Remarkably , two examples have emerged in a single species , the Tasmanian devil , a marsupial carnivore . These tumours are known as Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( or DFT1 ) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( or DFT2 ) ; both cause tumours round the faces of infected devils . Since it emerged in the 1990s , DFT1 has killed 60\u201390% of the devil population . Preserving the few remaining healthy devils has been a major challenge for conservationists . This challenge became more urgent in 2014 , when the second contagious cancer , DFT2 , was discovered circulating in the population . Contagious cancers are rare because the immune system usually eliminates cells coming from outside the body . Each healthy cell carries molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) that act as a barcode showing where each cell comes from . The immune system uses these molecules to help it tell the difference between the body\u2019s own cells and those from elsewhere . DFT1 can avoid the immune system and spread to new hosts because it has lost MHC . In 2014 , scientists identified a new Tasmanian devil cancer named DFT2 , but it was unclear how this second cancer evades the immune system as it spreads from host to host . Caldwell et al . have now examined the MHC on cells from DFT2 cancers , including cells grown in the laboratory and cells taken from cancer biopsies . Biochemical tests showed that the DFT2 cells do carry MHCs , but that the MHC barcodes of DFT2 are similar to those of the devils infected with the disease . This finding may explain how the cancer can spread undetected in these animals , because the immune system does not recognize it as coming from outside the body . Further analyses also reveal that the cancer cells are slowly evolving to lose their MHCs . This means DFT2 could , with time , become as contagious as DFT1 . These two contagious cancers threaten the future of the Tasmanian devil . As top predators , devils are key to the ecosystem in Tasmania and their preservation is vital . While DFT2 provides a unique opportunity to study an emerging cancer as it develops , this research will also help to protect the devils and may lead to effective vaccines . These results could also reveal how other cancers avoid the immune system and may help to detect them during treatment . In addition , there are many similarities between contagious cancer cells and organ transplants . Understanding the role of MHC in DFT2 could lead to better ways to prevent rejection following transplants .",
        "first_gen": "The Tasmanian devil is the only mammal species in which two different types of cancer are present. Both cancers are caused by a protein called the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ), which is found on the surface of the tumour. This protein is important for the immune system to detect and respond to the cancer. However, it is not clear how the two cancers develop. To investigate this question, Pye et al. used a technique called immunohistochemical and drug sensitivity analyses to identify the genes that are expressed in the cells of a species of fruit fly called Tasmanians devil. The experiments show that the gene encoding the main HHC protein, called DFT1, is only present in a small number of individuals. In contrast, the other two proteins, known as the T cell receptor and TCR, are found in many individuals, including humans, dogs and molluscs. Further analysis revealed that in contrast to a normal human population, a population of Tasmania devil cells is more likely to develop the disease. These findings suggest that this population may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of another contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1, that was first discovered in Tasmania in 1996, but has since spread widely in humans and other mammals. Furthermore, some of these cells express a different class of proteins than the normal cells, suggesting that they may have evolved from a similar tissue to one that already harbours two contagious cancers. Together, these findings provide new insights into the evolution of this disease, and may help to guide the development of new treatments for these diseases."

Recent evidence has shown that this area contains \u2018low-rheobase\u2019 neurons which are not seen anywhere else in the brain , but what do these neurons do ? Brennan , Jedrasiak-Cape , Kailasa et al . decided to explore the role of these neurons , focusing on the brain regions they are connected to . Experiments were conducted in mice using optogenetics , a technique that activates neurons using pulses of light . This revealed that brain areas involved in processing information about direction and position preferentially communicate with low-rheobase neurons rather than with nearby , more standard neurons in the retrosplenial cortex . The way these spatial signals are sent to the low-rheobase neurons allows these cells to \u2018calculate\u2019 how fast a mouse is turning its head using only information about which direction the mouse is facing . Essentially , this neuron can turn directional compass-like signals into a gyroscope signal that can track both direction and speed of head movement . These unique neurons may therefore be ideally suited to combine information about direction and space , suggesting that they may have evolved specifically to support spatial navigation . Individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease show exactly the same type of spatial disorientation as individuals with direct damage to the retrosplenial cortex . This region is also one of the first to show altered activity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease .

To investigate this question, Yamawaki et al. used a technique called channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) to map the activity of neurons in a region of a brain known as the basal ganglia. This revealed a double-dissociation that allows neurons from two different types of cortical regions to communicate with each other. The neurons involved in this process are called low-rheobase ( LR ) neurons and regular-spiking neurons. However, it was not known how LR neurons are positioned to receive these inputs, and how they are able to do so.

Traumatic brain injury often causes seizures in the short term and is a risk factor for certain dementias , including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in the long term . A protein called Tau undergoes a series of chemical changes in these dementias that makes it accumulate , form toxic filaments and kill neurons . The toxic abnormal Tau proteins are initially found only in certain regions of the brain , but they spread as the disease progresses . Previous studies in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other diseases where Tau proteins are abnormal suggest that Tau can spread between neighboring neurons and this can be promoted by neuron activity . However , scientists do not know whether similar mechanisms are at work following traumatic brain injury . Given that seizures are very common following traumatic brain injury , could they be partly responsible for promoting dementia ? To investigate this , researchers need animal models in which they can measure neural activity associated with traumatic brain injury and observe the spread of abnormal Tau proteins . Alyenbaawi et al . engineered zebrafish so that their Tau proteins would be fluorescent , making it possible to track the accumulation of aggregated Tau protein in the brain . Next , they invented a simple way to perform traumatic brain injury on zebrafish larvae by using a syringe to produce a pressure wave . After this procedure , many of the fish exhibited features consistent with progression towards dementia , and seizure-like behaviors . The results showed that post-traumatic seizures are linked to the spread of aggregates of abnormal Tau following traumatic brain injury . Alyenbaawi et al . also found that anticonvulsant drugs can lower the levels of abnormal Tau proteins in neurons , preventing cell death , and could potentially ameliorate dementias associated with traumatic brain injury .

It is also a major risk factor for dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and several other dementias.

Traumatic brains injury can lead to a range of symptoms, including seizures, post-traumatic seizures and brain death. However, the mechanisms that trigger the spread of these symptoms are still poorly understood. To address this problem, Wang et al. genetically engineered zebrafish larvae to produce a genetically encoded fluorescent protein that can detect the accumulation of human Tau proteins in their brain and spinal cord. The experiments showed that the mutant animals were more likely to spread the Tau protein to distant regions, such as in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and CTE. Further experiments revealed that these animals also had more Tau inclusions than normal wild-type mice, suggesting that they may be able to prevent the spreading of Tau pathology.

Differentiation is regulated at the genetic level , and the development of myofibers relies on the activation of muscle-specific genes . A gene\u2019s expression is typically controlled via a nearby regulatory region of DNA called a promoter that can be recognized by various molecular machines made from protein complexes . In most adult tissues , such regulatory machineries contain a complex called TFIID .

But when Bridge et al . tried to train the animal on a visual task , it proved unable to learn like the other monkeys . A brain scan revealed that it had almost no primary visual cortex , probably because of an abnormality that arose early in development . Further studies of the monkey\u2019s brain showed that the other structures involved in visual processing were in their usual places and were of normal size . Connections from the eyes to higher visual areas that bypass the primary visual cortex were normal , but were no stronger than in other monkeys . In fact , areas beyond the primary visual cortex showed no fundamental changes in how they processed visual information . The brain of this monkey had thus adapted to early loss of the major gateway from the eyes to higher visual cortex . Visual areas of the brain beyond the primary visual cortex continued to work as normal , helping to minimize vision loss . Because the visual brain differs little between primates , this discovery could also benefit patients with blindsight . It suggests that targeting higher visual areas could further improve vision in patients with damage to the primary visual cortex .",
        "first_gen": "The primary visual cortex ( V1 ) of primates is the brain\u2019s main gateway for information from the retina, which is responsible for guiding movement around the world. Previous studies have suggested that the loss of visual function may lead to impaired vision in people with visual impairments. However, it is not clear whether this is also the case in humans. In a rare case of a brain lesion, a macaque monkey was born without a visual processing pathway called V5/MT. This pathway sends information to a region of the cortex called the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) that is involved in processing visual information. The lesions to this region are thought to have been caused by damage to the primary vision pathway. Miki et al. have now used magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to examine the structure of this pathway and found that it was not affected by the lesions. Further experiments showed that, even in monkeys that had been born with lesions, the structures outside the visual pathway remained intact. These findings suggest that there may be a link between the damaged visual pathways and residual vision. Future studies are also needed to understand how this process works."

One way that the immune system can identify these invaders is by detecting genetic material from the microbes . Like us , many of these microbes have genetic material made of a two-stranded molecule called DNA . A protein called IFI16 is an important sensor in immune cells that can bind to foreign DNA , but not to the DNA of the host . If the ability to discriminate between host and foreign DNA is lost , then immune cells start to attack the body\u2019s own tissues , which can lead to severe \u201cautoimmune\u201d diseases . However , it is not clear how IFI16 and other sensor proteins are able to tell foreign and host DNA apart . DNA in host cells is packaged in particular proteins to form structures called nucleosomes that can make it difficult for other proteins to bind to the DNA . When foreign DNA enters the cell , IFI16 promotes the formation of nucleosomes on these molecules , but the nucleosomes are further apart than those in host DNA , which leaves longer stretches of \u201cexposed\u201d DNA between the nucleosomes . In 2014 , a group of researchers reported that multiple molecules of IFI16 associate with each other and form clusters on exposed foreign DNA . Here , Stratmann , Morrone et al . \u2013 including some of the researchers from the earlier work \u2013 investigated how IFI16 selectively binds to foreign DNA using a combination of biochemical and single-molecule techniques . The experiments show that to start with , a few molecules of IFI16 bind to stretches of exposed foreign DNA and then move along the DNA strands . As more molecules of IFI16 bind to this DNA , they bump into each other and start to form clusters that eventually become immobile . Further experiments show that the more tightly packed nucleosomes in host DNA molecules act as a barrier to IFI16 cluster formation because they interfere with the ability of the protein to move along the DNA . Stratmann , Morrone et al . \u2019s findings show that IFI16 can only trigger immune responses when it binds to stretches of exposed DNA that are long enough to allow the assembly of IFI16 clusters . The next challenge will be to see whether other DNA sensors employ similar strategies to detect foreign DNA .",
        "first_gen": "The human immune system detects infections by detecting the presence of foreign DNA in the host\u2019s DNA. This detection process is called cytosolic detection machineries, and it is used to detect pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms by which this process works are not fully understood. For example, when a virus infects a cell, its DNA is not exposed until it reaches the nucleus, where it can be detected by its own immune cells. In the cytoplasm, a protein called interferon-inducible protein 16 ( IFI16 ) is a key sensor that detects foreign double-stranded ( ds ) DNA and uses it as a scaffold to assemble supramolecular signaling platforms that trigger inflammatory responses on the DNA of the infected cell. Morrone et al. have now used biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques to show that a single molecule of this sensor is able to track long stretches of exposed foreign DsDNA. The experiments showed that the I FI16 sensor tracks the movements of other proteins that are present inside the nucleosome, which is where the virus is most likely to enter the cell and cause it to become infected. Together, these findings reveal a new molecular mechanism that allows the immune systems to distinguish between foreign and non-foreign DNA by directly interfering with the assembly of these proteins. Further work is now needed to understand how this mechanism works and to develop a better understanding of how it works."

In many of these diseases , toxic proteins accumulate in the brain and build up as small \u2018plaques\u2019 in the gaps , or synapses , that cells called neurons communicate across . Eventually , the plaques prevent the neurons signaling to each other correctly , leading to problems such as memory loss . Identifying the proteins present in plaques is technically challenging , partly because the plaques are very small . Hadley , Rakhit et al . have now developed a new method called spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( or STOMP ) that can collect proteins from small areas of cells . In this method , plaques are identified under a light microscope , and their contents are attached to a molecule called a photo-affinity tag using lasers . The photo-tagged proteins are then pulled out using beads that specifically bind to the photo-affinity tag . The proteins can then be identified using a well-established method called mass spectrometry . Hadley , Rakhit et al . used STOMP to analyze plaques present in the brains of mice that develop similar symptoms to those seen in humans with Alzheimer's disease . This revealed that these plaques contain more than 50 different proteins , some of which had not previously been found in plaques . In particular , several proteins from the \u2018presynaptic\u2019 neuron that sends signals across the synapse were found in the plaques . However , no proteins from the receiving ( \u2018postsynaptic\u2019 ) neuron on the other side of the synapse were present in the plaque . Fixed human brain tissue is more difficult to analyze than mouse samples because it is modified for storage . In spite of these issues , Hadley , Rakhit et al . successfully also used STOMP to identify the proteins in human plaques . STOMP can be used to identify the proteins present in any area of a cell and thus has the potential to be widely used by scientists , not just those studying plaques .",

A technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ) can be used to identify the proteins that are important for the formation of proteins in the brains of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The technique uses two-photon laser scanning microscopy and mass spectrometry to study the structure and composition of protein deposits in a tissue sample. In the experiments, researchers were able to use a fluorescent dye or antibodies to detect the presence of specific proteins within the tissue. However, it was not possible to precisely identify these proteins because they were too small to be identified. Now, Sipe et al. have developed a new technique that uses a laser to capture the entire tissue of a mouse model and a post-mortem human brain. Using this technique, the researchers have identified the protein components of several proteins. These proteins were then tagged with a photo-tag, which was then applied to all of them. Further experiments showed that the photos-tags were more accurate than previous methods, and the results were consistent with the findings of previous studies. Overall, these results show that STomP is a powerful tool that can identify new proteins and help researchers to develop new ones."

They do this by lengthening their axons\u2014the \u2018cables\u2019 along which electrical signals flow\u2014and some axons in adult humans can grow to be more than 1 metre long . This type of long-range pathfinding activity is particularly common for neurons that control movement , as many of these neurons must establish connections with muscles that are some distance away from the brain . For example , motor neurons in the brainstem form connections with muscles in the face to control facial expressions , while motor neurons in parts of the spinal cord project to muscles in the limbs . Multiple signaling pathways tell the developing axons which direction to grow en route to their final targets . Now , Hua et al . have shown that an evolutionarily conserved protein called Frizzled3 is also involved in this process . In mouse embryos that lacked Frizzled3 , the motor nerves that control breathing and limb movements were thinner than those in normal mice . In the mutant animals , many motor axons failed to form connections with their targets . Instead , these axons came to an abrupt halt midway along their intended paths and the neurons from which they originated died soon afterwards . These experiments support the idea that developing neurons are programmed to die unless their axons progress on the appropriate schedule . As well as increasing our knowledge of the networks of connections that form within the developing mammalian nervous system , the work of Hua et al . provides new insights into some of the molecular mechanisms by which these connections are established .",

Now, Bonanomi et al. have used a technique called planar cell polarity ( or PCP for short ) to investigate the role of a protein called Frizzled3 in developing motor neurons. This protein is found in many different types of nerve cells, but it was not known how it works in mammals. The experiments show that a small group of proteins in a gene called Fz3 are required for the growth of motor neuron growth. These proteins are produced in two groups: the lateral motor column, which is responsible for controlling the direction of axon growth; and the ventral column that controls the orientation of muscles. In both groups of neurons, the cells in both directions are unable to form connections with each other, leading to the formation of new connections between neurons and their targets. Further experiments showed that the proteins that form these connections are also involved in guiding the development of other nerve cell types, such as the phrenic nerve and nerve plexus. Together, these findings suggest that cells with long-range nerve growth may be programmed not to die unless they arrive at their target on time."

Transposable elements \u2013 repetitive sequences that are present in many species \u2013 make up around half of the mouse genome . They are \u2018selfish\u2019 elements , in that the spread of them within the genome does not necessarily benefit the host organism . But sometimes transposable elements can be \u2018domesticated\u2019 , and used to the host\u2019s advantage . For example , transposable elements can generate new genes . In other cases , their non-coding sequences can regulate the activity of other nearby genes or even those elsewhere in the genome . It remains unclear to what extent transposable elements have shaped genome regulation throughout evolution . One idea is that the spread of transposable elements can help to establish large regulatory networks \u2013 whereby many genes are collectively regulated to produce a specific output . But it has not been fully explored how effective transposable elements are at regulating gene expression . Now , Todd et al . investigate whether particular transposable elements , that are suspected to boost the activity of other genes , are essential for normal gene expression in early mouse development . Todd et al . genetically edited stem cells from the inner and outer layer of the early mouse embryo to find transposable elements that promote gene expression . Whilst some transposable elements were found to be important for gene regulation , not all of the candidates tested were needed to maintain expression levels . To widen the search , several transposable elements were turned off simultaneously by compacting specific stretches of DNA so that they could no longer be activated . When 34 transposable elements were inactivated at once , it emerged that only three transposable elements had a significant impact on gene expression . These findings suggest that whether or not a given transposable element regulates gene expression cannot be predicted solely from profiling the structure and sequence of the genome . This highlights why it is important to interrogate the effect transposable elements have ona gene's role within a cell . Transposable elements are largely disregarded in genomics due to technical difficulties in analysing these repetitive stretches of DNA . But characteristic variations within a population may in part be driven by differences in these parts of the genome , which may also be implicated in diseases such as cancer .

        "first_gen": "Transposable elements ( or TEs for short ) are a group of proteins that are found in the genome of the embryo. These proteins are thought to be involved in regulating the expression of genes. However, it is not clear how they are regulated by the host. In the early embryo, for example, a protein called transcription factor ( TF ) binds to a gene in a way that allows it to switch on or off genes in specific tissues. This allows the gene to change its activity in response to changes in its environment, which in turn can lead to the development of new tissues and organs. It is therefore important to understand the role of these proteins in gene regulation in early development. Previous research has shown that a large number of TE families are important for regulating gene expression in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of mice. Now, Schoenfelder, Sundaram et al. have used genetic and epigenetic techniques to examine the roles of a set of long-terminal repeat TE family members in mouse embryonic stem cells and trophoblast stem cell cells. The experiments revealed that only a small proportion of all the long terminal repeat elements in these cells were active in their early stages of development, suggesting that they play a key role in controlling gene activity. Further experiments showed that the longer terminal repeats were more active than their counterparts in other tissues, such as the placenta and the gut. Furthermore, the shorter the repeats, their activity was less active when they switched on genes that were not active at the same time. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of functional tests when evaluating gene regulatory roles in preimplantation."

        "ground_truth": "Plants rely on carbon for their growth and survival: in a process called photosynthesis , they use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen gas . The chemical reactions that make up photosynthesis are powered by a chain of enzymes , and plants must ensure that these enzymes\u2014which are in the leaves of the plant\u2014are supplied with enough carbon dioxide and water . Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere enters plants through pores in their leaves , but water must be carried up the plant from the roots . The type of photosynthesis used by about 90% of flowering plant species\u2014including tomatoes and rice\u2014is called C3 photosynthesis . The first step in this process begins with an enzyme called RuBisCO , which reacts with carbon dioxide and a substance called RuBP to form molecules that contain three carbon atoms ( hence the name C3 photosynthesis ) . In a hot climate , however , a plant can lose a lot of water through the pores in its leaves: closing these pores allows the plant to retain water , but this also reduces the supply of carbon dioxide . Under these circumstances this causes problems because RuBisCO uses oxygen to break down RuBP , instead of creating sugars , when carbon dioxide is not readily available . To prevent this process , which wastes a lot of energy and resources , some plants\u2014including maize , sugar cane and many other agricultural staples\u2014have evolved an alternative process called C4 photosynthesis . Although it is more complex than C3 photosynthesis , and required many changes to be made to the structure of leaves , C4 photosynthesis has evolved on more than 60 different occasions . In C4 plants , the mesophyll\u2014the region that is associated with the capture of carbon dioxide by RuBisCO in C3 plants\u2014contains high levels of an alternative enzyme called PEPC that converts carbon dioxide molecules into an acid that contains four carbon atoms . To avoid carbon dioxide being captured by both enzymes , C4 plants evolved to relocate RuBisCO from the mesophyll to a second set of cells in an airtight structure known as the bundle sheath . The four-carbon acids produced by PEPC diffuse to the cells in the bundle sheath , where they are broken down into carbon dioxide molecules , and photosynthesis then proceeds as normal . This process allows photosynthesis to continue when the level of carbon dioxide in the leave is low because the plant has closed its pores to retain water . Since C4 plants grow faster than C3 plants , and also require less water , plant biologists would like to introduce certain C4 traits into C3 crop plants . To help with this process , Williams , Johnston et al . have used computational methods to explore how C4 photosynthesis evolved from ancestral C3 plants . This involved investigating the prevalence of 16 traits that are common to C4 plants in a total of 73 species that undergo C3 or C4 photosynthesis ( including 37 species that possess characteristics of both C3 and C4 ) . Williams , Johnston et al . then went on to produce a new mathematical model that represents evolutionary processes as pathways across a multi-dimensional \u201clandscape\u201d . The model shows that traits can be acquired in various orders , and that C4 photosynthesis evolved through a number of independent pathways . Some traits that evolved early in the transitions to C4 photosynthesis influenced how evolution proceeded , providing \u201cfoundations\u201d upon which further changes evolved . Interestingly , the structure of the leaf itself appeared to change before any of the photosynthetic enzymes changed . This led Williams , Johnston et al . to conclude that climate change\u2014in particular , the declines in carbon dioxide levels that occurred in prehistoric times\u2014was probably not responsible for the original evolution of C4 photosynthesis . Nevertheless , these results could help with efforts to adapt important C3 crop plants to on-going changes in our climate .",
        "first_gen": "C4 photosynthesis is one of the most efficient photosynthetic processes on the planet. Plants use this process to grow crops and native vegetation in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia and the Americas. The C4 pathway is thought to have first evolved between 32 and 25 million years ago, in response to a decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, it is not clear how the evolution of this pathway has evolved. Now, Sage et al. have used a mathematical model to identify the evolutionary paths that have led to the emergence of many complex traits in plants. These include the ability of plants to produce more carbon dioxide than previously thought, and changes to their leaf anatomy, cellular ultrastructure and metabolism to increase the efficiency of photoynthesis. This allows the plant to evolve into a variety of different types of plant, including plants that use C3, C2, or intermediate plants, to take photos of their leaves. Sage and Hatch then developed a new mathematical system that predicts which of these pathways the plants use to make photos. Using this system, they identified 18 different species that are able to use the same pathway in different ways. They were then compared to those that do not use a pathway that evolved from the ancestral pathway, which is known as a \u2018hidden Markov model\u2019. Together, the results show that the two-celled plants have evolved independently from each other in at least 60 different pathways. Further work is now needed to determine which pathways are most likely to be involved in this evolution."

ATP is present in all living cells and is often referred to as the energy currency of the cell , because it can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed . However , it is unknown why cells rely so heavily on ATP when a highly similar nucleotide called guanosine triphosphate , or GTP , could also act as an energy currency . There are several examples of proteins that originally used GTP and have since evolved to use ATP , but it is not clear why this switch occurred . One suggestion is that ATP is the more readily available nucleotide in the cell . To test this hypothesis , Updegrove , Harke et al . studied a protein that helps bacteria transition into spores , which are hardier and can survive in extreme environments until conditions become favorable for bacteria to grow again . In modern bacteria , this protein uses ATP to provide energy , but it evolved from an ancestral protein that used GTP instead . First , Updegrove , Harke et al . engineered the protein so that it became more similar to the ancestral protein and used GTP instead of ATP . When this was done , the protein gained the ability to break down GTP and release energy from it , but it no longer performed its enzymatic function . This suggests that both the energy released and the source of that energy are important for a protein\u2019s activity . Further analysis showed that the modern version of the protein has evolved to briefly hold on to ATP after releasing its energy , which did not happen with GTP in the modified protein . Updegrove , Harke et al . also discovered that the levels of GTP in a bacterial cell fall as it transforms into a spore , while ATP levels remain relatively high . This suggests that ATP may indeed have become the source of energy of choice because it was more available . These findings provide insights into how ATP became the energy currency in cells , and suggest that how ATP is bound by proteins can impact a protein\u2019s activity . Additionally , these experiments could help inform the development of drugs targeting proteins that bind nucleotides: it may be essential to consider the entirety of the binding event , and not just the release of energy .",

A protein called SpoIVA is an enzyme that is found in a bacterium called Bacillus subtilis. This enzyme is thought to have evolved from a GTPase, but it has switched its activity to using ATP instead of the more abundant ATP molecule. To investigate this, Ramamurthi et al. used a technique called site directed mutagenesis to recreate the activity of a bacterial ATPase. The experiments revealed that the enzyme was not able to use ATP in its original role. Instead, the enzymes switched their activity toward using the ATP molecules that are needed for the cell\u2019s genetic material to form a new cell type called the endospore. In addition, this enzyme did not form an intermediate that would be required for ATP polymerization. These findings suggest that this change in activity was due to the evolutionary pressure exerted by the bacteria to switch off ATP from ATP and instead use it for other biological functions. Further work is now needed to understand how this evolution occurred."

In animals and fungi , these proteins directly work with a specific class of receptor proteins called G protein-coupled receptors ( or GPCRs for short ) . Plants also have heterotrimeric G proteins , but it remains unclear whether they similiarly work with GPCRs . Plants detect invading microbes by using receptors that are completely different from GPCRs . For example , a receptor called FLS2 from the model plant Arabidopsis senses a telltale protein produced by bacteria , and then passes the signal to another protein called BIK1 to activate the plant\u2019s defenses . Heterotrimeric G proteins are required for this process , but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown . Liang , Ding et al . now show that heterotrimeric G proteins regulate FLS2-controlled defenses by directly interacting with FLS2 and BIK1 . Heterotrimeric G proteins also enhance defenses in at least two different ways . Firstly , in the absence of an infection , heterotrimeric G proteins stabilize the BIK1 protein to ensure that it is ready to respond . Secondly , if FLS2 does detect the telltale bacterial protein , BIK1 marks one of the heterotrimeric G proteins with a phosphate group . This then allows the G protein to boost the activity of another plant enzyme that is vital for defense signaling . In the future , it will be important to work out how activation of FLS2 leads to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins .

In the pre-activation state, the G protein interacts with the receptor to produce a molecule called GDP, which is required for the cell division process to work properly. However, it is not clear how the two proteins interact. To investigate this question, Maruta et al. genetically engineered plants that had been exposed to a bacterium called Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato to see if the bacteria could activate their defenses.

Further experiments showed that the mutant plants had a different type of immune response than normal plants and that they had different levels of G\u03b1 and G\u03b2 proteins in their cells. When the plants first received the antibiotic treatment, their immune responses were much better than expected, suggesting that these proteins regulate the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) that are needed for plants to defend themselves against pathogens.

In response , many organisms have evolved internal biological clocks which are synchronized with the rhythm of light and dark . Thanks to this \u2018circadian clock\u2019 , plants and animals can predict the onset of dawn and dusk , and schedule biological processes to specific times of the day . Each cell possesses its own circadian clock , which is formed of a complex network of genes and proteins that get activated along a 24-hour cycle . This raises the question: how do these cells coordinate to create a body clock at the level of the entire organism ? In mammals , this synchronisation happens thanks to a structure in the brain , but much less is known about how this occurs in plants . This is partly because few studies exist that focus on measuring the clocks of individual plant cells . Here , Gould , Domijan et al . monitor the circadian clock of single cells in seedlings of a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana across several days and under constant environmental conditions . To do so , they use time-lapse microscopy and genetic methods to see when and where one of the clock\u2019s core genes is switched on . The results show that , at the level of the plant , Arabidopsis has two waves of clock gene expression , one that goes up and one that goes down the root . In addition , the various parts of the plant have slightly different circadian rhythms \u2013 for instance , the tip of the root has a faster clock . Robust clock rhythms are also detected in individual cells across the plant . Clocks in neighbouring cells are found to communicate with each other to keep track of time , which might be contributing to this robustness . Mathematical simulations show that , when the individual clocks interact , they generate patterns of clock activity across the plant , which explains the two waves of gene expression in the root . Plant circadian rhythms control traits that are crucial for agriculture , such as growth , yield , disease resistance and flowering time . Understanding , and ultimately controlling , the intricate cogs of these clocks may one day allow scientists to create better performing crops .",

However, it remains unclear how robust the circadian rhythm is in individual cells, or how well it is coordinated across the plant. To answer this question, Takahashi et al. used a technique called luciferase reporter to measure the activity of a protein called CCA1, which is found in the fruit and vegetable seedlings. The experiments show that the Cca1 protein is active in many different parts of the seedling, including the shoots, the roots, and the root tip. This suggests that a core circuit that generates the 24-hr rhythm in single cells is also involved in other processes, such as photosynthesis. But it was not clear how much of this circuit is actually in cells at the same time. It was also not known how many cells are active at a single time and how fast the clock is at each time interval. Now, Sakamoto, Fukuda, Harmer and Hsu have combined the data from several studies to create a simple mathematical model that can be used to study the rhythms of individual cell activity in different plant species. In the model, each cell in a particular plant was measured by measuring its activity at different time intervals. Each cell was able to produce two waves of gene activity, one going up and one down. These waves were then compared to each other over several days, suggesting that different cell types have different rhythms. Furthermore, this model showed that cells can synchronise their activity with one another, similar to that seen in mammalian circadian clocks. Taken together, these findings suggest that unlike the centralised mammalian clock in which cells synchronize their genes to regulate the time of day or night, circadian rhythms are synchronized across different plants. Future work will be needed to understand how this synchronisation works in more detail."

        "ground_truth": "Our ears were not designed for the society our brains created . The World Health Organization estimates that a billion young adults are at risk for hearing problems due to prolonged exposure to high levels of noise . For many people , the first symptoms of hearing loss consist in an inability to follow a single speaker in crowded places such as restaurants . However , when Parthasarathy et al . examined over 100 , 000 records from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear audiology database , they found that around 10% of patients who complained about hearing difficulties were sent home with a clean bill of hearing health . This is because existing tests do not detect common problems related to understanding speech in complex , real-world environments: new tests are needed to spot these hidden hearing disorders . Parthasarathy et al . therefore focused on identifying biological measures that would reflect these issues . Normally , the brain can \u2018unmix\u2019 different speakers and focus on one person , but even in the context of normal hearing , some people are better at this than others . Parthasarathy et al pinpointed several behavioral and biological markers which , when combined , could predict most of this variability . This involved , for example , measuring the diameter of the pupil while people are listening to speech in the presence of several distracting voices ( which mirrors how intensively they have to focus on the task ) or measuring the participants\u2019 ability to detect subtle changes in frequency ( which reflects how fast-changing sound elements are encoded early on in the hearing system ) . The findings show that an over-reliance on high-level cognitive processes , such as increased listening effort , coupled with problems in the early processing of certain sound traits , was associated with problems in following a speaker in a busy environment . The biological and behavioral markers highlighted by Parthasarathy et al do not require specialized equipment or marathon sessions to be recorded . In theory , these tests could be implemented into most hospital hearing clinics to give patients and health providers objective data to understand , treat and monitor these hearing difficulties .",
        "first_gen": "As we grow older, our hearing is less able to process speech in noisy environments. For example, when we hear someone talking to us in a noisy environment, the brain unmixes the speech from nearby speakers into a stream of sounds. This process is known as \u201csignaling fine structure processing\u201d ( sTFS ), but it is not clear how this process works. To find out, researchers have used a technique called ear canal EEG recordings to track the activity of people who have lost their hearing. The results showed that people with reduced hearing were less likely to be diagnosed with hearing difficulties when they visited a clinic because of hearing loss. However, this was not the case for those who had lost the ability to hear other people\u2019s speech. Instead, these people were told that they had no hearing at all, and that their speech was fine. These findings suggest that individuals with lower hearing may be more likely than normal to have problems with communication difficulties. Now, Undurraga et al. have developed a new method to measure the variability in speech intelligibility in healthy people. In the experiments, 23 young or middle-aged adults were asked to listen to a familiar male speaker in the presence of two other male speakers. When the volunteers listened to the same speaker, they could hear the sounds of the other speakers at different frequencies. They could also hear sounds that were louder than those coming from their left or right ears, which could explain why they were unable to distinguish between the two voices. Further experiments revealed that this variability could be explained by a combination of brain processing, pupil-indexed listening effort and behavioral FM thresholds. It was also possible that the low-level levels of neural processing and brain activity in these individuals might be due to their loss of speech-in-noise processing."

Turbulence in the air distorts the light as it passes through , causing it to bend , which blurs the image . To get a clear picture of distant objects , astronomers use a technique called 'adaptive optics' . Deformable mirrors , controlled by computers , bend the light back to correct the distortion . Now , biologists are borrowing the same technique to take a closer look at the blood vessels of the brain . At the moment , functional MRI is one of the most popular imaging techniques for measuring blood flow in the brain . But it can only achieve a resolution of around 1 millimetre , and the tiniest capillaries measure less than a hundredth of a millimetre across . These tiny vessels can be examined surgically , or by injecting dyes into the bloodstream , but these techniques carry a risk . As a result , scientists can only use them in experimental animals . One solution is to look at the vessel network in the back of the eye . The retina is part of the brain and , because the eye is transparent , its blood supply is much easier to see . But imperfections in the eye bend light and blur images of the cells , just like the Earth's atmosphere blurs images of the stars . This is where adaptive optics comes in . Using this technique , it becomes possible to see single red blood cells . Combining adaptive optics with high-speed video could allow us to track cells through the whole network of blood vessels in the eye . At the moment , blood flow measurement techniques either focus on the very big vessels , or the very small ones; they cannot get a complete picture of the whole interconnected system . Now , Joseph et al . have combined adaptive optics , ultrafast imaging , and a new algorithm to view the whole blood vessel network in the eye of a mouse . The new method can automatically measure single blood cells , even when they are moving at their highest possible speed . It can capture the full range of retinal vessels , from the smallest capillaries to the largest arteries and veins . And , by tracking millions of cells at a time , it can reveal how the pressure wave of the blood changes with each beat of the heart . The slightest disruption in blood flow to the brain can cause irreversible damage . So , measuring blood flow is crucial to understanding what happens when things go wrong . This new method is not invasive and uses safe levels of near-infrared light which the retina cannot see , making it safe to use in humans . Joseph et al . have already started their first studies in humans , and the baseline data they have obtained for healthy mice also provides a starting point for comparison with mice with genetic mutations or disease .",
        "first_gen": "The retina is one of the most widely used eyes in the human body. It is surrounded by a network of blood vessels called capillaries. This network is made up of hundreds of thousands of cells, each with a different shape and size. However, it is not clear how these cells are moving in and out of these vessels. One way to understand this is to use microscopy, which is a technique called optical coherence tomography ( or OCT for short ). The technique can detect single blood cells in a capillary, but it can also be difficult to measure the flow of a single cell. To overcome this problem, Guevara-Torres et al. used the mouse retina to study single-cell blood flow, a type of eye disease that affects the retina of mammals. Using the microscope, the mice were able to see single cells traveling through the blood. In addition, they could also measure how much blood they were moving. These measurements were then used to compare the size and speed of each blood cell, and to determine whether the cells had died or were still alive. Further experiments showed that this was the case for many diseases, including diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, in which cells die within a short period of time. Overall, these results demonstrate that the eye is the world's most commonly used laboratory animal, yet there is still a huge gap in understanding how the brain works and how it responds to changes in health and disease."

        "ground_truth": "Like all plants , crop plants need nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate to grow . Often these essential elements are in short supply , and so millions of tons of fertiliser are applied to agricultural land each year to maintain crop yields . Another way for plants to gain access to scarce nutrients is to form symbiotic relationships with microorganisms that live in the soil . Plants pass on carbon-containing compounds\u2014such as sugars\u2014to the microbes and , in return , certain fungi provide minerals\u2014such as phosphates\u2014to the plants . Some plants called legumes ( such as peas , beans , and clovers ) can also form relationships with bacteria that convert nitrogen from the air into ammonia , which the plants then use to make molecules such as DNA and proteins . To establish these symbiotic relationships with plants , nitrogen-fixing bacteria release chemical signals that are recognized via receptor proteins , called NFR1 and NFR5 , found on the surface of the plant root cells . These signals trigger a cascade of events that ultimately lead to the plant forming an organ called \u2018root nodule\u2019 to house and nourish the nitrogen-fixing bacteria . A similar signalling mechanism is thought to take place during the establishment of symbiotic relationships between plants and certain soil fungi . A plant protein called Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( or SYMRK for short ) that is also located on the root cell surface is required for both bacteria\u2013plant and fungi\u2013plant associations to occur . However , the exact role of this protein in these processes was unclear . Ried et al . have now investigated this by taking advantage of a property of cell surface receptor proteins: if some of these proteins are made in excessive amounts they activate their signalling cascades even when the initial signal is not present . Ried et al . engineered plants called Lotus japonicus to produce high levels of SYMRK , NFR1 , or NFR5 . Each of these changes was sufficient to trigger the plants to develop root nodules in the absence of microbes . Genes associated with the activation of the signalling cascade involved the formation of root nodules were also switched on when each of the three proteins was produced in large amounts . In contrast , only an excess of SYMRK could activate genes related to fungi\u2013plant associations . Ried et al . also found that , while SYMRK can function in the absence of the NFRs , NFR1 and NFR5 need each other to function . These data suggest that the receptor proteins play a key role in the decision between the establishment of an association with a bacterium or a fungus . As an excess of symbiotic receptors caused plants to form symbiotic structures , Ried et al . propose that this strategy could be used to persuade plants that usually do not form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to do so . If this is possible , it might lead us to engineer crop plants to form symbiotic interactions with nitrogen-fixing bacteria; this would help increase crop yields and enable crops to be grown in nitrogen-poor environments without the addition of extra fertiliser .",
        "first_gen": "The plant Lotus japonicus has a symbiotic relationship with a fungus called arbuscular mycorrhiza. The two species share a common ancestor, which is known as rhizobia and Frankia bacteria. Both are found in the soil of the plant, and both are able to form symbioses with each other. However, it is not clear how the symbiosis works. To find out, Antol\u00edn-Llovera et al. used a technique called quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) to measure the levels of two genes that are required for the formation of symbiotes. First, a protein called Nod Factor Receptor 1 ( NFR1 ) and a gene called SYMRK are involved in forming the nodules. Second, the two gene-like kinases are needed to generate the calcium-spiking genes. These genes are also found on the surface of root hair cells in plants, but it was not known how they work together to produce the specific genes needed for this process. Now, Kistner and Parniske have used the same technique to investigate the role of these genes in plant nodule formation. This revealed that when the root hairs of a plant were exposed to a nutrient-fixing bacterium, they were more likely to develop nodular structures than normal roots. Further experiments showed that the genes were activated independently of either the NTR1 or the other gene that encodes the enzyme that codes for these proteins. In addition, when plants were treated with an antibiotic that inhibits the activity of both genes, these roots were also more sensitive to the antibiotic. Together these findings provide a new tool to study how plants and fungi communicate."

Computer programs that measure and analyze animal movement have made these studies faster and easier to complete . These tools have also made more advanced behavioral experiments possible , which have yielded new insights about how the brain organizes behavior . Recently , scientists have started using new machine learning tools called deep neural networks to measure animal behavior . These tools learn to measure animal posture \u2013 the positions of an animal\u2019s body parts in space \u2013 directly from real data , such as images or videos , without being explicitly programmed with instructions to perform the task . This allows deep learning algorithms to automatically track the locations of specific animal body parts in videos faster and more accurately than previous techniques . This ability to learn from images also removes the need to attach physical markers to animals , which may alter their natural behavior . Now , Graving et al . have created a new deep learning toolkit for measuring animal behavior that combines components from previous tools with the latest advances in computer science . Simple modifications to how the algorithms are trained can greatly improve their performance . For example , adding connections between layers , or \u2018neurons\u2019 , in the deep neural network and training the algorithm to learn the full geometry of the body \u2013 by drawing lines between body parts \u2013 both enhance its accuracy . As a result of adding these changes , the new toolkit can measure an animal's pose from previously unseen images with high speed and accuracy , after being trained on just 100 examples . Graving et al . tested their model on videos of fruit flies , zebras and locusts , and found that , after training , it was able to accurately track the animals\u2019 movements . The new toolkit has an easy-to-use software interface and is freely available for other scientists to use and build on . The new toolkit may help scientists in many fields including neuroscience and psychology , as well as other computer scientists . For example , companies like Google and Apple use similar algorithms to recognize gestures , so making those algorithms faster and more efficient may make them more suitable for mobile devices like smartphones or virtual-reality headsets . Other possible applications include diagnosing and tracking injuries , or movement-related diseases in humans and livestock .",

Now, Pereira et al. have developed a software toolkit that can automatically measure the movements of an animal\u2019s body parts directly from images or videos. This is a major improvement over existing methods for measuring movement, which rely on computer vision to capture and analyze images and videos of the animal. Previous methods used to measure movement were limited to capturing and analyzing images of individual animals, but these methods are now widely used in many experimental settings. These methods can also be used for studying the behavior of large groups of individuals in a laboratory, for example, by measuring the movement of a dog or a cat. In the past, researchers had to manually annotate the images to make sure that they were accurate. But, in recent years, computer-vision technology has made it possible to use deep-learning algorithms to automatically estimate the positions of animals in images, videos, or audio recordings. Using DeepPoseKit could help researchers to improve the accuracy of these algorithms and reduce the time and effort required to analyze the data. Moreover, the new tools are more efficient than previous methods, and they are less time-consuming than current methods. Furthermore, they have a much faster processing speed compared to current algorithms. Further work is now needed to test these new methods in more experimental situations."

Macrophages can sense a wide variety of danger signals associated with the presence of infectious microbes , and some of these signals cause macrophages to form protein complexes called inflammasomes inside the cell . Inflammasomes produce molecules that stimulate inflammation and trigger the death of the macrophage . This attracts other immune cells to the infection site to help combat the source of danger . Inflammasome complexes form around an activated receptor molecule called NLRP3 . NLRP3 is activated by a range of danger signals , including those produced by Salmonella bacteria . However , the sequence of events that leads to NLRP3 activation is still not well understood . Sanman et al . have now identified a small molecule that unexpectedly causes the formation of inflammasomes via NLRP3 and so triggers the death of macrophages . Further investigation revealed that this molecule disrupts glycolysis , a process macrophages use to produce energy . The energy imbalance caused by disrupting glycolysis triggers a stress response in macrophages , which ultimately activates the NLRP3 receptor and hence the inflammasome . Sanman et al . then found that Salmonella bacteria also activate the inflammasome by disrupting glycolysis when they invade macrophages . This occurs because the bacteria use up the macrophage\u2019s supply of glycolysis precursor molecules . Replenishing the macrophage with products of glycolysis restored partial energy production and prevented the inflammasome from being activated . Overall , Sanman et al . have identified a previously unknown trigger of inflammation and cell death in macrophages whereby cells can respond to infectious bacteria by sensing a change in energy levels . A next step will be to define the signaling molecules that activate NLRP3 to trigger the construction of the inflammasome . Sanman et al . also hope to uncover other infections and diseases where changes in energy balance might trigger inflammation and cell death .",
        "first_gen": "Inflammation is an immunological process required for an organized response to infection, injury, and stress. Immune cells such as macrophages have evolved a network of proteins called Nod-like receptors ( NLRs for short ) that are activated when they are challenged with an infection or infection by pathogens. The NLR proteins are then recruited to the inflammasome complex, which is responsible for triggering the activation of the NLRP3 proteins. However, it is not clear how the IL-1\u03b2 signaling pathway is activated. Lamkanfi, Dixit et al. have now identified an important signaling network in the immune cells of mice and humans that is involved in regulating the levels of inflammatory proteins in these cells. This network is known as the \u2018nodlike receptor\u2019 and is active in a wide variety of pathogens, including Salmonella typhimurium, a bacterium that causes a form of cell death called pyroptosis. In the experiments, the mice were treated with a drug that inhibits the production of a protein called NLP3, but it was not known whether the drug was active or inactive. Instead, they were exposed to a range of drugs that reduced the amount of NADH in their cells and prevented them from producing the enzyme needed for the cell to respond properly. Further experiments showed that the drugs were able to trigger the formation of two different types of NK cells, one of which was inactive and the other that did not. These findings reveal a mechanism by which inflammatory signaling networks can be activated by the presence or absence of other molecules."

These sources of stress can cause breaks in the genome , which if left unrepaired can lead to cancer or cell death . One of the most accurate ways to repair a broken fragment of DNA is through recombination \u2013 whereby an undamaged copy of the sequence is located in another DNA molecule and used as a template to replace the missing fragment . DNA recombination is regulated by more than a dozen proteins that help recruit the enzyme RAD51 to sites of DNA damage , and trigger its search for complementary sequences of DNA . A molecule known as PALB2 binds to these DNA repair proteins and coordinates their activity . If PALB2 , or these other proteins become mutated , this can increase the risk cancerous growths in various tissues , including the breasts and ovaries . Having a better understanding of how this group of proteins control the repair process could therefore improve prognosis and advance cancer treatments . Now , Deveryshetty et al . have discovered a new and unexpected role for PALB2 within the recombination pathway . As well as binding to other repair proteins , PALB2 interacts directly with DNA , and this interaction was found to be an important part of the repair process . Even in the absence of RAD51 , PALB2 was still able to recombine short fragments of DNA sequence . PALB2 achieves this by initiating recombination using single strands of DNA or a DNA-like molecule known as RNA . This latter property may be particularly important if the molecular machines needed to replicate DNA and synthesize RNA collide on the same DNA molecule . This new role for PALB2 could lead to the discovery of other DNA repair mechanisms , and could be used to predict which PALB2 mutations are more likely to cause cancer . Patients who are at greater risk of cancer could then be treated with more advanced therapies , in order to increase their chances of recovery .",

Breast cancer is caused by a genetic disorder called breast cancer, in which a protein called BRCA2 plays a key role in repairing damaged DNA. This protein, called PALB2, is an essential component of a family of proteins that are found in many mammals, including humans, and is involved in a wide range of cancers. In particular, it is thought that it helps to protect the DNA of cancerous cells. However, the precise role of this protein is not fully understood. To address this question, Brouwer et al. have now identified a new protein that is important for the repair of damaged chromosomes. The protein has been shown to bind to DNA and to other proteins, but it was not clear how it does this. Now, Zhao, Luijsterburg and Zhao have used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to study the protein in human cells and found that mutations in one of these proteins can reduce the efficiency of DNA repair in cancer cells by 50%. Further experiments showed that a mutation in another protein known as N-DBD, which binds to the same part of BCRA1, can also cause the cell to lose the ability to repair damaged chromosome repair. These findings reveal a novel protein binding site that allows the cells to use RNA as a substrate to attach DNA to it. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of an enzyme called RAD51 for repairing DNA damage. A next step will be to find out how this enzyme works in more detail in future studies."

Shape is important for bacterial cells because it plays a role in cell division , helps to maximize the uptake of nutrients , and aids cell movement . The shape of a cell is determined mainly by its cytoskeleton , a form of \u2018scaffolding\u2019 within the cell that is made of various protein filaments . The bacterial cytoskeleton was discovered over 20 years ago , but it has not been studied as much as the cytoskeletons of yeast , plant , animals , and other eukaryotes . Many of the bacterial proteins and filaments that make up the cytoskeleton are similar to those found in eukaryotes . A protein called MreB , for example , is the bacterial equivalent of actin , which performs a wide range of roles in eukaryotes . However , van den Ent , Izor\u00e9 et al . have now shown that the detailed structure of MreB filaments is different to that of actin filaments . It has been known for some time that actin filaments are composed of two strands of actin proteins that are twisted and parallel with each other . MreB filaments are also made of two strands of MreB proteins , but van den Ent , Izor\u00e9 et al . found that these strands are straight , not twisted , and that they are antiparallel rather than parallel . Thus , unlike other filaments of actin-like proteins , where the two ends of the filament are clearly different from each other , the antiparallel strands of MreB form a double filament without a clear direction . van den Ent , Izor\u00e9 et al . also showed that MreB double filaments can bind to surfaces that mimic a bacterial cell membrane , and that mutant bacterial cells without these double filaments adopt the wrong cell shape .

To investigate this question, Kabsch et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structures of Caulobacter crescentus. The experiments showed that the proteins assemble in pairs in an antiparallel fashion. This is similar to the way that other proteins, such as GTP, are assembled in other organisms. Further experiments revealed that a doublet is essential for the formation of these pair-of-protofils, and that it binds to membrane proteins in the presence of antimicrobial agents A22/MP265. Together, the experiments show that MREB and the anti-oxidant agents are able to bind together and form pairs that are similar in shape to those found in many other bacteria. Furthermore, when the two proteins interact, they can bind close to one another, preventing the membranes from breaking apart. Kaballah-Stabile and L\u00f6we also found that these proteins bind tightly to their membranes, allowing them to be used to treat bacterial infections.

This process involves the formation of internal staples that keep the molecule of proinsulin folded correctly . Individuals developing type 2 diabetes have spikes of sugar in their blood , and so their bodies often respond by trying to make large amounts of insulin . After a while , the beta cells can fail to keep up , which brings on the full-blown disease . However , scientists have discovered that early in type 2 diabetes , the endoplasmic reticulum of beta cells can already show signs of stress; yet , the exact causes of this early damage are still unknown . To investigate this , Arunagiri et al . looked into whether proinsulin folds correctly during the earliest stages of type 2 diabetes . Biochemical experiments showed that even healthy beta cells contained some misfolded proinsulin molecules , where the molecular staples that should fold proinsulin internally were instead abnormally linking proinsulin molecules together . Further work revealed that the misfolded proinsulin was accumulating inside the endoplasmic reticulum . Finally , obese mice that were in the earliest stages of type 2 diabetes had the highest levels of abnormal proinsulin in their beta cells .

This arrangement helps to inactivate genes that are not needed in specific cells or at specific times , and provides a way to protect the genetic material from damage . Heterochromatin tends to form when an enzyme called a lysine methyltransferase chemically modifies some of the proteins associated with the DNA , which are known as histones . This enzyme modifies only some of the histones to get the process started , while a second protein then binds to the modified histones and causes more of the DNA to become packaged up as heterochromatin . In 2012 , researchers reported that the version of the lysine methyltransferase enzyme from yeast binds to RNA molecules via a portion known as its chromodomain . Moreover , the enzyme needed to bind to RNA to help heterochromatin to form . A similar mechanism also occurs in fruit flies , another organism that is commonly studied in the laboratory .

The first experiments were conducted using purified enzymes in the laboratory , while follow-up experiments looked at the enzyme\u2019s activity within mouse cells . Other studies have previously reported that mutant mice lacking the lysine methyltransferase enzyme have defective heterochromatin , tend to die young and have genetic instabilities that are associated with an increased risk of tumors and male infertility . The new findings of Shirai , Kawaguchi et al . reveal that the mechanism behind the establishment of heterochromatin has mostly likely been conserved over a billion years of evolution , which is when yeast and mammals last shared a common ancestor . By revealing more about how mammalian cells can protect their DNA , these new findings could also mark an important step toward understanding and preventing birth defects that are caused when an embryo\u2019s genetic material becomes damaged .",
        "first_gen": "Heterochromatin is a complex structure of DNA that is made up of a series of proteins called histones. The histone H3K9-specific methyltransferase ( SUV39H ) is involved in the assembly of these proteins. In fission yeast, it is known as the \u2018silent\u2019 chromatin, and it has been shown that it can bind nucleic acids to specific regions of the DNA. However, the precise role of this enzyme is not well understood. It was previously thought that the activity of an enzyme called Suv39h1, which is responsible for the production of H1 proteins, was linked to its ability to bind to DNA, but this was not the case. Now, Ishida et al. have used a technique called electrophoretic mobility-shift assays ( EMSAs ) to investigate whether the enzyme could bind DNA via its chromodomain ( CD ). This revealed that a protein called SUV39 h1-CD binds to a region called the pericentromere, where DNA is stored. When the CD was added to the EMSA, this made it easier for SUVs to attach to this region. Further experiments showed that this binding was also important for SuVsH1 to be able to target specific chromosomal regions. These findings suggest that SuVSH has a role in this process. Furthermore, these findings may help scientists to understand the role that DNA plays in DNA assembly."

A network of regions deep within the brain acts a little like an inbuilt GPS and tracks our position relative to other objects in the environment . Cells in one of these brain regions , called the entorhinal cortex , construct a map of our surroundings . The map resembles a grid of tessellating triangles , and the cells that produce it are called grid cells . Whenever we move onto a corner of one of the triangles , the corresponding grid cells start to fire . This firing enables the brain to track our movements . But grid cells may do more than support navigation through the physical world . They may also help us navigate through our memories . Evidence suggests that we organize our knowledge and experiences into mental maps . These maps connect related concepts just as physical maps connect nearby locations . In principle , the brain systems that support physical navigation may also enable us to access the information within our mental maps . But for this to be true , cells such as grid cells must respond to movement in mental space as well as in physical space . Wilming et al . have now tested this possibility by training macaque monkeys to detect a color change in a dot moving across a screen . The monkeys had to keep their eyes fixed on the center of the screen throughout the task . This meant they could not move their eyes to track the dot . Instead they had to mentally move the focus of their attention . Wilming et al . monitored the activity of cells in the entorhinal cortex as the monkeys mentally followed the dot . As predicted , some of the cells fired in a triangular grid-like pattern similar to that seen when animals move through their environment . Grid cells can thus fire in the absence of physical movement . These findings bring us closer to understanding how brain circuits that code for spatial locations also support other mental processes . Evidence from many sources suggests that structures within the brain\u2019s medial temporal lobe , including the entorhinal cortex , contribute to memory . The next challenge is to identify how these brain regions encode spatial and other types of information and use them to form memories .",

These cells are active during movements of attention, such as moving around a computer monitor. Grid cells also help us to remember where we are when we need to be, and to plan our next move. However, it is not clear whether grid cells can also be activated during covert attention. To answer this question, Killian et al. recorded the activity of 141 neurons in a brain region of two rhesus macaque monkeys performing a task that involves tracking a small dot that moved around the computer screen. The monkeys were trained to respond by releasing a response bar when the dot changed color. This signaled that the monkey was at a choice point. In the experiments, the monkeys had to focus on a dot with a triangular tiling on the screen and then respond to it as it moved. They were then asked to repeat the same task for a second time. When they repeated the task again, they were shown a grid-like representation of their location. It was unclear whether these cells were activated by the movement of eye-movements, or if they responded by responding by moving their gaze to a specific dot. Spatial representations, in particular, of the location of an animal\u2019s gaze, could be useful for remembering and planning."

Researchers therefore need to know all the details of previous experiments in order to implement the procedures as exactly as possible . However , this is becoming a major problem in neuroscience , as animal studies of behavior have proven to be hard to reproduce , and most experiments are never replicated by other laboratories . Mice are increasingly being used to study the neural mechanisms of decision making , taking advantage of the genetic , imaging and physiological tools that are available for mouse brains . Yet , the lack of standardized behavioral assays is leading to inconsistent results between laboratories . This makes it challenging to carry out large-scale collaborations which have led to massive breakthroughs in other fields such as physics and genetics . To help make these studies more reproducible , the International Brain Laboratory ( a collaborative research group ) et al . developed a standardized approach for investigating decision making in mice that incorporates every step of the process; from the training protocol to the software used to analyze the data . In the experiment , mice were shown images with different contrast and had to indicate , using a steering wheel , whether it appeared on their right or left . The mice then received a drop of sugar water for every correction decision . When the image contrast was high , mice could rely on their vision . However , when the image contrast was very low or zero , they needed to consider the information of previous trials and choose the side that had recently appeared more frequently . This method was used to train 140 mice in seven laboratories from three different countries . The results showed that learning speed was different across mice and laboratories , but once training was complete the mice behaved consistently , relying on visual stimuli or experiences to guide their choices in a similar way . These results show that complex behaviors in mice can be reproduced across multiple laboratories , providing an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools for studying decision making . This work could serve as a foundation for other groups , paving the way to a more collaborative approach in the field of neuroscience that could help to tackle complex research challenges .",

This means that it is possible to measure and reproduce the same mouse behavior in multiple laboratories. However, reproducibility has been a problem in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of decision-making in mice. Previous research has shown that mice can learn to make decisions by using visual stimuli. For example, a mouse can detect the presence of a visual grating to their left or right, and report the perceived location with a simple movement: by turning a steering wheel, for example. Mice in different laboratories were trained to perform this task. The experiments involved training 140 mice in which they were asked to choose between two different types of stimuli: the left and the right. When the mice were given a choice between the two stimuli, they chose the one that was most likely to be more likely. In the experiments, mice learned the task by making a series of decisions based on their past successes and failures and on estimates of the likelihood that they would be rewarded for making the correct choice. Overall, the results show that mouse decision making is reproducible across laboratories, which is important because it allows researchers to compare and compare the data and methods available for studying the behavior of different animals. Future studies should use this data to develop new approaches to studying mice behavior."

Each species in this family produces its own distinct shape of electrical signals . Other fish detect these signals using structures called receptors , which then send information to the brain in the form of an electrical nerve impulse . Previous research showed that different species of fish respond to different aspects of the electric fields they detect , depending on the receptor types that they have evolved . For example , some species have \u2018spiking receptors\u2019 that send a spike of activity to the brain at the start or end of a detected electrical pulse . This allows the fish to detect subtle changes to the shape of the detected electric field . Other species have sensors known as oscillatory receptors; these send a continuous wave of nerve activity to the brain even when no electric field is detected . It is not clear exactly how oscillatory receptors work or what the roles of these different receptor types are . Baker et al . have now recorded the activity of the receptors of mormyrid fish as they were exposed to electrical fields that mimic the signals they are normally exposed to in their daily environment . The recordings confirmed previous results that suggest that species with spiking receptors are able to detect variations in the shapes of electrical signals produced by other fish because the receptors produce spikes of activity at the start or end of a detected signal . This response pattern allows their brains to analyze the signal shape . In contrast , Baker et al . found that when oscillatory receptors detect a new electric field , they reset their pattern of nerve activity , causing multiple receptors to briefly synchronize their activity . This enables the fish to detect where a signal has been sent from . However , the oscillatory receptors are unable to detect any variations in the shape of the detected electric signal . The oscillatory receptors are most sensitive to certain electric field patterns that are produced by large groups of a single species of fish . Further experiments showed that the fish also change their behavior when these particular electric field patterns are detected . Why some species of mormyrids have spiking receptors while others have oscillatory receptors is unknown . It is also unknown how the brain processes oscillatory receptor activity . Future studies will investigate whether these two receptor types may be linked to differences in fish's social behavior , and how the neural networks for processing sensory information differ between the two types of fishes .",

For example, the brain pathway that processes electrical signals can switch on and off at different times in response to different stimuli. However, it is not clear how these differences in sensory activity are related to how animals communicate. Carlson, Arnegard et al. have now investigated how different species of mormyrid fish communicate by producing receptors that fire a single, time-locked spike at variable interpulse intervals ( IPIs ). These receptors are clustered in three groups, called rosettes, on each side of the head, back, and underbelly. This means that the receptors of some species are sensitive to changes in electric signals, whereas those of others are not sensitive at all. In contrast, some of these receptors fire spikes at the same time, but not waveforms. The results of this study suggest that these divergent mechanisms may explain the evolution of our ability to sense subtle variation in electrical signal activity.

Among the general public , Bordetella species have become a hot topic in recent years due to the re-emergence of whooping cough in the United States and elsewhere . Scientists , meanwhile have become interested in a virus called BPP-1 that can kill the Bordetella species . BPP-1 is a double-stranded DNA virus , and such viruses have long been of interest to scientists because they are the most abundant organisms on Earth . These viruses are also noteworthy because their shells ( also known as capsids ) are capable of withstanding the very high pressures ( up to about 40 atmospheres ) that are created by packing so much DNA into the very small volume inside the capsid . BPP-1 is of particular interest because it is capable of making large-scale changes to its own DNA in order to adapt to changes in its hosts and environment . Of all the organism that do not contain nuclei within their cells ( collectively known as prokaryotes ) , BPP-1 is the only one that is capable of making such changes to its DNA . However , efforts to exploit the properties of BPP-1 for bioengineering applications have been hampered because its detailed structure is not known . Now Zhang et al . have used cryo electron microscopy to study the structure of BPP-1 at the atomic level . Most viruses belong to one of three major lineages , with each lineage having a characteristic fold in its capsid proteins . Zhang et al . found that BPP-1 contains two of these folds , which suggests that it is a hybrid of two of these lineages . This is the first time that such a structure has been observed . Moreover , Zhang et al . found that one of the folds has an unusual topology that has not been seen before . The atomic structure reveals how double-stranded DNA viruses use a variety of non-covalent interactions and a type of protein \u2018chainmail\u2019 to form a highly stable capsid that is capable of withstanding very high pressures . In addition to enabling applications in bioengineering , the new structure might also provide insights into the evolution of prokaryotes .",

To find out, researchers have used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of the virus\u2019s genome.

However, it was not known how these proteins interact with each other. Now, Krupovic, Bamford et al. have developed an atomic model that shows the three proteins that make up the head of a bacterium called B-Protein B ( or BP for short ) in a way that is similar to that seen in the jellyroll motif. These two proteins are found in many different types of viruses and are thought to be essential for the formation of phages. In particular, they are known to form a structure called the Jellyroll-like structure, which is also known as the Johnson fold, and is used by many other viruses to make proteins. Together, these findings suggest that a new topology may be the only feasible alternative to the old topological structure."

This virus is able to adapt to different environments, but it is not clear how it does so. To investigate this question, Domingo et al. used a technique called CirSeq RNA sequencing to study the viral genomes of infected humans and mosquitos. Using this technique, the viruses were genetically modified to produce different versions of the virus. In the experiments, each virus was exposed to a different host, and each individual virus underwent a series of rounds of infection. Each virus had a unique set of genetic mutations that made it more likely that it would survive in its host\u2019s body temperature, cellular machineries and environment. These mutations were then copied into the DNA of each viral cell line, where they were sequenced to identify the genetic variants that were most likely to occur in a given viral population. Further analysis revealed that the number of beneficial and deleterious mutations in each population varied between the host and the cell lines. However, some of these beneficial mutations did not accumulate under positive selection, while others accumulated under negative selection. Overall, these findings reveal the evolutionary constraints that shape the evolution of viral populations. Future studies are also needed to understand how viruses evolve in different ways."

Ras proteins are attached by a fatty tail to the inner surface of the cell membrane . When activated they transmit a burst of signal that controls critical behaviors like growth , survival and movement . It has been suggested that to prevent these signals from being accidently activated , Ras molecules must group together at specialized sites within the membrane before passing on their message . However , visualizing how Ras molecules cluster together at these domains has thus far been challenging . As a result , little is known about where these sites are located and how Ras molecules come to a stop at these domains . Now , Lee et al . have combined two microscopy techniques called \u2018single-particle tracking\u2019 and \u2018photoactivated localization microscopy' to track how individual molecules of activated Ras move in human cells grown in the lab .

However , computer models consisting of just the \u2018fast\u2019 and \u2018immobile\u2019 state could not correctly re-capture the way Ras molecules moved along the membrane . Lee et al . found that for these models to mimic the movement of Ras , a third \u2018intermediate\u2019 state of Ras mobility needed to be included . To investigate this further , Lee et al . created a fluorescent map that overlaid all the individual paths taken by each Ras molecule . The map showed regions in the membrane where the Ras molecules had stopped and possibly clustered together . Each of these \u2018immobilization domains\u2019 were then surrounded by an \u2018intermediate domain\u2019 where Ras molecules had begun to slow down their movement . Although the intermediate domains did not last long , they seemed to guide Ras molecules into the immobilization domains where they could cluster together with other molecules . From there , the cell constantly removed Ras molecules from these membrane domains and returned them back to their \u2018fast\u2019 diffusing state .

The prevailing view among scientists is that the BMP gradient is created by an opposing gradient of another protein called Chordin , which is found at high levels at the back of the embryo and lower levels near the front . Chordin inhibits BMP and the interaction between the two proteins establishes the gradients that create order across the embryo . Zinski et al . used computer models to investigate how the BMP gradient is created . Several possibilities were considered , including the effect of Chordin . Comparing the models to precise experimental measurements of BMP activity in zebrafish embryos suggested that a different mechanism known as a source-sink model , rather than the opposing Chordin gradient , may be responsible for the pattern of BMP found in the embryo . In this model , the BMP is produced at the front of the embryo and moves towards the back end by diffusion . At the back of the embryo , BMP is mopped up by Chordin , resulting in a constant gradient of BMP along the embryo .

In vertebrates, the activity of a protein known as a morphogenic gradient is regulated by a network of extracellular regulators. These regulators bind to a receptor called the metalloprotease Tolloid ( Tld ), which is responsible for regulating the signaling levels of many other proteins. However, it was not clear how the gradient was formed. Now, Shilo et al. have used mathematical models to investigate the mechanisms by which a gradient can be formed in zebrafish and other vertebrate embryos. The experiments show that the stem cells that produce the protein in a particular form of protein ( called a \u2018morphogen gradient\u2019 ) are active in all the different stages of development. Chordin, Noggin and Follistatin are the main antagonists that block the expression of this protein, but they are also used as ligand antagonists in other animals, such as frogs and fish.

Mice without GLMP were found to have very similar liver problems to those observed in the mice lacking MFSD1 . Moreover , the GLMP deficient mice had low levels of the MFSD1 protein . Further experiments demonstrated that MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact with each other: GLMP seemed to protect MFSD1 from being degraded in the harsh internal environment of the lysosome .

The experiments revealed that MFSD1 is a highly glycosylated protein and that it contains a sorting motif needed for it to be sorted to ensure that the protein is sorted correctly.

It is thought that this enzyme is needed to transport the LMP protein, but it was not known what role it plays in this process. Further experiments showed that a group of other proteins called the major facilitator superfamily ( Mfsd1 ) plays an important role in maintaining a normal level of MFDS1 in LYSOSomes. Furthermore, this protein was found to interact with a subunit of another protein known as MFS1 that was also important for its transport to LMSs.

Large molecules such as proteins are commonly transported within a cell by \u2018motor proteins\u2019 , which move along a network of filaments called microtubules . One group of motor proteins , the kinesins , typically have one end called a motor domain that attaches itself to a microtubule . The other end links to the cargo being carried , and a flexible \u2018neck\u2019 region connects the two ends of the motor protein . Kinesins are bound together in pairs . The flexible neck region allows each motor domain in a pair to move past that of the other , allowing the kinesin to \u2018walk\u2019 along a microtubule in a step-like manner . Each step requires one motor domain to alternately tightly associate with , and then release from , a microtubule filament . This alternating cycle is coordinated by kinesin binding to and breaking down a molecule called ATP to form another molecule called ADP , which releases the energy needed for its next step . This repeating cycle is possible because a motor domain changes shape when it binds to a microtubule . This shape change stimulates the release of ADP , freeing up room for a new ATP molecule to bind to the motor domain . Although relatively small , these structural changes produce larger changes in the flexible neck region that enable the individual motor domains within a kinesin pair to co-ordinate their movement and move efficiently . Many previous studies have investigated these shape changes using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy , which rapidly freezes samples and allows their structure to be recorded in high detail . However , the small size of the motor domains and their changes in shape means that this technique was not able to reveal the structures in full detail . Shang et al . now exploit recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy to examine the structural changes of individual kinesin motor domains in greater detail . Images of motor domains bound to microtubules were made while the motor domain was in one of two different states: not bound to ATP or ADP , or bound to a chemically modified form of ATP that cannot be broken down . Shang et al . then used these images to produce models of the motor domains and compared the models with previously published images . This revealed a cleft in the kinesin motor domain that opens when it attaches to a microtubule . This cleft's \u2018clamshell-like\u2019 opening allows ADP to be released; it then closes when a molecule of ATP binds to it . The opening and closing of the cleft causes the changes in the \u2018neck linker\u2019 of the kinesin that enable the motor protein to transport its cargo , and so links ATP binding to the movement of the motor protein . Shang et al . suggest that similar processes may also occur in other motor proteins that have not been as well studied as the kinesins .",

However, it is not clear how these co-ordinated steps are controlled. To investigate this question, Rath and Kozielski used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of a motor domain on a protein called kinein. Using X-ray crystallography, they were able to reconstruct a series of structures that were similar to those seen in previous studies. These structures were then compared with the structures of other proteins that are found in the same family of motors. This revealed that the three-dimensional structures are similar in shape and size, suggesting that these structures may be linked by a specific \u2018linchpin\u2019 residue. Further work is now needed to understand how this structure works, and how it can be used as a therapeutic drug target."

If proteins lose that shape , not only do they stop working but they risk clumping together and becoming toxic , potentially leading to disease . Fortunately , the cell has quality control systems that normally detect and remove misfolded proteins before they can cause damage to the cell . First , sets of proteins known as chaperones recognize the misfolded proteins , and then another class of proteins attaches a molecular tag , known as ubiquitin , to the misshapen proteins . When several ubiquitin tags are attached to a protein , forming chains of ubiquitin , it is transported to a large molecular machine within the cell called the proteasome . The proteasome unravels the protein and breaks it down into its constituent building blocks , which can then be used to create new proteins . Proteins are found throughout the different compartments of the cell and quality control processes have been well-studied in some parts of the cell but not others . Metzger et al . have now revealed how the process works on the surface of mitochondria , the compartment that provides the cell with most of its energy . To do this , they used baker\u2019s yeast , a model laboratory organism that shares many fundamental properties with animal cells , but which is easier to manipulate genetically . The quality control process was studied using two mitochondrial proteins that had been mutated to make them sensitive to changes in temperature . This meant that , when the temperature increased from 25\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C , these proteins would begin to unravel and trigger the clean-up operation . This approach has been used previously to understand the quality control processes in other parts of the cell . By removing different quality control machinery in turn from the yeast cells , Metzger et al . could detect which were necessary for the process on mitochondria . This showed that there were many similarities with how this process happen in other parts of the cell but that the precise combination of chaperones and enzymes involved was distinct . Furthermore , when the proteasome was not working , the misfolded proteins remained on the mitochondria , showing that they are not transported to other parts of the cell to be broken down . In the future , understanding this process could help to find potential drug targets for mitochondrial diseases . The next steps will be to see how well these findings apply to human and other mammalian cells .",
        "first_gen": "Maintaining the essential functions of a cell\u2019s mitochondria is essential for the survival of the cells. Proteins are made from proteins that are misfolded, which can lead to their destruction by other proteins in the cell. This process is known as quality control ( QC ). QC is the process by which proteins are degraded to ensure that they are properly folded. However, it is not clear how QC works in mammals or yeast. To find out, Kowalski et al. studied the degradation of proteins from the outer membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a fruit fly that is thought to be involved in mitochondrial health and well-being. The experiments show that a number of QC pathways are involved, including one called temperature-sensitive ( ts- ) and another called SUM-associated degradation ( MAD ) pathway. Mitochondria are highly sensitive to temperature, but it was not known how these proteins were degraded in yeast, or how they were targeted for degradation by QC. In the experiments, the yeast cells were grown at 25\u00b0C for 40 min and then exposed to temperatures that were higher than the normal temperature. These experiments revealed that the temperature sensors were able to detect and degrade the proteins, while the MAD pathways were not. Further experiments showed that this MAD pathway was also found in other cells, such as mammals, yeast and humans. Together, these findings reveal a unique QC pathway that can recognize, degrade, and destroy proteins. It is also possible to identify and remove proteins with the help of other factors that have been previously identified."

Both of these roles subject the skin to wear and tear and so it must constantly create new skin cells to replace those lost or damaged . However , if this renewal process goes awry it can lead to excessive cell growth or skin cancer . To avoid this , cells tightly regulate the pathways that stimulate skin renewal . Skin renewal involves growth signals activating an enzyme called ERK . When and where the ERK enzyme is activated is normally tightly regulated , and many kinds of cancer have been linked to ERK becoming active at the wrong time or in the wrong place . Despite the importance of ERK in skin cells , a number of technical challenges have made it difficult to study how these signals are passed from cell to cell . Hiratsuka et al . have now examined genetically altered mice that produce a fluorescent sensor molecule that makes it possible to see ERK activity in living skin cells . The skin of anesthetized mice was observed under a microscope , and time-lapse videos revealed occasional \u2018firework-like\u2019 bursts of ERK activity . At first the ERK enzyme was active in a small cluster of skin cells , then ERK activity was seen in the surrounding cells\u2014appearing to spread outwards over the course of several minutes\u2014before the activity stopped . Hiratsuka et al . named this pattern of activity a \u2018Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution\u2019 , or SPREAD for short . By studying SPREADs in the skin on the ears and the back of these mice , Hiratsuka et al . learned that these bursts of ERK activity coincided with skin cell growth; the bursts happened more frequently in the areas where the skin cells were dividing . Applying a chemical that stimulates cell division to the skin of the mice triggered more bursts of ERK activity; whereas fewer bursts were observed if Hiratsuka et al . used other chemicals to block the activity of some of the signaling proteins that work upstream of ERK . Further experiments suggested that SPREADs encourage cells to progress through the cycle of events that leads a cell to divide; blocking these bursts caused the cell to pause at the stage just before it would normally divide . Hiratsuka et al . also observed similar patterns of ERK activity moving out like waves from the edges of skin wounds . Further research using similar methods will reveal how growth signals are triggered and propagated in healthy and diseased tissues , not only in the skin but also other organs such as the liver , intestine , and muscles .",
        "first_gen": "In the epidermis, a protein called extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) is responsible for controlling the activity of many cells in the body. This protein is made up of a group of proteins called EGF receptors, which are released from the cell membrane and are then released into the tissue. When a cell divides, the signal is sent to another cell in a radial wave that travels from cell to cell. However, it is not clear how this process is regulated in living cells. Now, Kamioka et al. have used a biosensor to image mice that had been genetically engineered to be able to see the signals that are sent from cells to cells as they divide. The experiments revealed that when the mice were exposed to a chemical called mitotic stimulation, they would occasionally appear with bursts of activity that radially propagated from a cluster of cells into a region of the mouse skin. In contrast, when they were treated with a drug, this activity was not seen. Instead, these bursts were seen as a \u2018spatial projection\u2019 of radial activity distribution ( SPREAD ), where the activation of an enzyme called 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) was stimulated in parallel to the growth factor receptor and its cognate ligands ( EGFRs ). Further experiments showed that the spatial projections were associated with the rate of cell division. These findings provide new insights into how cell-to-cell communication is synchronised in cells and tissues."

        "ground_truth": "All life forms on the surface of our planet face an environment that cycles between day and night as the Earth rotates around its axis . To deal with these regular changes , organisms from bacteria to humans have internal rhythms , called circadian clocks , that coordinate different aspects of these organisms\u2019 lives , from growth to the urge to sleep , with the day-night cycle . The simplest of all known circadian clocks is found in bacteria called cyanobacteria , which live in bodies of water all around the world . Like plants , these microorganisms can harness the energy in sunlight to fuel their growth . The internal clock of cyanobacteria is remarkable because it can be rebuilt in the laboratory using just three components , proteins called KaiA , KaiB and KaiC . When mixed together in a test tube , these proteins spontaneously generate a 24-hour cycle in which KaiC gets chemically modified by the addition and removal of a phosphate group . These chemical modifications on KaiC are like the hands of the clock that tell the time of day . Much work on the internal clock of cyanobacteria has focused on how the clock proteins generate rhythms . What has been less clear is how this rhythm works in an environment that changes between day and night and from season to season . For example , away from the equator , the length of the day changes throughout the year . Changes in day length are important for cyanobacteria because they can grow only during the day and must rest at night . Yet , it was not understood how this microorganism's clock adjusts to days of different length . To address this question , Leypunskiy et al . made a device to grow cyanobacteria in many different light-dark cycles while monitoring their circadian rhythm . The experiments revealed a fairly simple result: the internal clock time is always the same at the middle of the day , regardless of how long the day is . Next , Leypunskiy et al . developed a way to study how the clock proteins in the test tube respond to chemical signals mimicking day and night . Unexpectedly , this showed that the Kai proteins themselves have the ability to track the middle of the day . It turns out that these proteins are not only able to generate a 24-hour rhythm , but also to correctly align it to the day-night cycle . Together , these findings will guide other researchers to better understand the molecular origins of how circadian clocks align to the day-night cycle . Moreover , by showing that the effects of a light-dark cycle on a circadian clock can be mimicked in a test tube , these results open the doors to using the tools of biochemistry to understand how circadian clocks work in natural environments .",
        "first_gen": "Cyanobacteria are a photosynthetic bacterium whose physiology is closely related to the 24-hour diurnal cycle. In the laboratory, the cyanobacterial circadian clock is driven by a set of proteins called KaiABC proteins. These proteins are found in many species of bacteria, but it is not clear how these proteins coordinate their activity in different ways. To investigate this question, Kageyama et al. have developed a mathematical framework that can be used to model how the circadian rhythm works in bacteria. The framework is based on a simple mathematical formula, and it can then be reconstituted in a wide range of environments. This allows the model to be applied to bacteria grown in living organisms that are closely linked to light and dark. KaeABC is a protein that is responsible for controlling the activity of many genes, including those involved in the production of oxygen and nutrients. It has been known for a long time that the kaiABC protein\u2019s activity scales linearly with the time of day and night. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control how circadian rhythms work in organisms with different days and seasons. Now, S. elongatus is able to track its biological rhythms using a series of LED illumination devices grown on solid media that mimic the light-dark cycles of its host species. Using this model, it was possible to predict the behavior of circadian clocks under many different conditions."

For example , these nerve cells are responsible for accelerating the heart rate during exercise . In a developing embryo , there are initially more of these neurons than are needed , and only those that develop correctly and form a connection with a target cell will survive . This is because the target cells provide the growing neurons with vital molecules called neurotrophins , which are trafficked back along the nerve fiber and into the main body of the nerve cell to ensure its survival . However , it is largely unknown which proteins or genes are also involved in this developmental process . Now , Bouilloux , Thireau et al . show that if a gene called Meis1 is inactivated in mice , the sympathetic neurons start to develop and grow nerve fibers , but then fail to establish connections with their target cells and finally die . The Meis1 gene encodes a transcription factor , which is a protein that regulates gene activity . Therefore , Bouilloux , Thireau et al . looked for the genes that are regulated by this transcription factor in sympathetic neurons . This search uncovered several genes that are involved in the packaging and trafficking of molecules within cells . Other experiments then revealed that the trafficking of molecules back along the nerve fiber was altered in mutant neurons in which the Meis1 gene had been inactivated . Furthermore , Meis1 mutant mice had problems with their heart rate , especially during exercise , and an increased risk of dying from a sudden cardiac arrest . These findings reveal a transcription factor that helps to establish a connection between a neuron and its target , and that activates a pattern of gene expression that works alongside the neurotrophin-based signals . Since all neurons undergo similar processes during development , future work could ask if comparable patterns of gene expression exist in other types of neurons , and if problems with such processes contribute to some neurodegenerative diseases .",
        "first_gen": "Cardio-vascular diseases and sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) are among the most common causes of death in young people. These diseases are caused by mutations in a gene called Meis1, which is found in many genes. This gene is involved in the development of the nervous system, and it is thought to play an important role in controlling the formation of sympathetic nerves. However, it was not clear how this gene plays a role. Now, Manousiouthakis et al. have shown that the gene that regulates the expression of genes that regulate the activity of these genes in mice leads to changes in how sympathetic neurons develop and how they respond to cardiac events. In the experiments, the mice were grown in an embryo and genetically modified to produce mice that had a mutation that caused the genes to be switched on or off. The mutant mice developed a condition in which the neurons were unable to reach their target organs and died within a few days of birth. Further experiments showed that this was due to the loss of a protein that is essential for the cell's internal organs to work properly. Furthermore, when the mouse neural crest was crossed with a mutant mouse that was genetically engineered to have mutations that reduced the production of proteins that are needed to make these proteins, these mice died prematurely and unpredictably before reaching adult stages of development. Together these findings suggest that mutations can alter the role of this protein in early development and may contribute to sudden death."

For example , stresses can build up within a tissue if one layer grows faster than an adjacent layer . The tissue can release this stress by wrinkling , folding or creasing . Though ancient and single-celled , bacteria can also develop spectacular patterns when they exist in the lifestyle known as a biofilm: a community of cells adhered to a surface . But do mechanical instabilities drive the patterns seen in biofilms ? To investigate , Yan , Fei , Mao et al . grew biofilms of the bacterium called Vibrio cholerae \u2013 which causes the disease cholera \u2013 on solid , non-growing \u2018substrates\u2019 . This work revealed that as the biofilms grow , their expansion is constrained by the substrate , and this situation generates mechanical stresses . To release the stresses , the biofilm initially folds to form wrinkles . Later , as the biofilm expands further , small parts of it detach from the substrate to form blisters . The same forces that keep water droplets spherical ( known as interfacial forces ) dictate how the blisters evolve , interact , and eventually shape the expanding biofilm . Using these principles , Yan et al . could engineer the biofilm into desired shapes . Collectively , the results presented by Yan et al . connect the shape of the biofilm surface with its material properties , in particular its stiffness . Understanding this relationship could help researchers to develop new ways to remove harmful biofilms , such as those that cause disease or that damage underwater structures . The stiffness of biofilms is already known to affect how well bacteria can resist antibiotics . Future studies could look for new genes or compounds that change the material properties of a biofilm , thereby altering the biofilm surface .",
        "first_gen": "Bacteria live in a community lifestyle called biofilms. These communities are made up of two or more layers of biomaterials that are attached to one another, and each grows at a different rate. This process is known as biofilm growth, but it is not well understood how these communities grow and develop. Now, Wang, Zhao et al. have used a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae as a model organism to study how the bacterial community grows and matures. The experiments show that the bacteria can grow at different rates depending on the amount of water they are exposed to. However, it was not clear how this process occurs. Wang and Zhao found that, in addition to being able to control the growth rate of the microbial community, they can also change the shape of its surface. Further experiments showed that these changes are driven by mechanical instabilities, such as wrinkling and delamination. In the experiments, the cells were inoculated onto a substrate that was too high in water and too low in nutrients, which resulted in the formation of blisters that formed at the edge of each cell\u2019s core. When these cells grew on an agar plate, their surface was wrinkled and their surfaces were covered with a layer of matrix components that made them more rigid than the substrate. As a result, these \u2018biofilm-substrate-associated bacterial communities grew faster than they had grown before. Furthermore, when the microorganisms grew at an air\u2013liquid interface, there were more wrinkles than there had been before, leading to the development of new cells and new tissues. To test whether this is the case in bacteria that grow on a surface that has been compressed by a nutrient-limited environment, Yang, Chen, Zhaoxing, Li, Meylan, Zhang, Yan, Xu, etc., used the model system to grow a variety of bacteria on surfaces that were not tightly packed by the environment. Each of these bacteria had different properties, including the ability to bend and fold, as well as the strength of their cells. Overall, this work provides a new understanding of how bacteria grow. It may also help us to understand how they adapt to changes in their environment and to improve health and industry."

During a seizure , brain cells send out abnormal signals , which can mean that people having seizures may be unaware of their surroundings and may fall or otherwise injure themselves . Individuals with epilepsy develop changes in their brain cells and in the circuits that connect these cells together . Some people develop epilepsy because they have mutations in genes . Others develop the condition after an injury or a long seizure , which leads to changes in gene expression and therefore changes to the brain's cells and circuits . In 2011 , researchers found that a protein that normally switches off the expression of certain genes during brain development , but which is almost absent in the adult brain , may run amok after a seizure . The level of this protein\u2014a transcription factor called NRSF\u2014increased in the brains of rats that had been caused to have a seizure . A long provoked seizure caused many of the rats to develop epilepsy . But , if NRSF was blocked after the original seizure , the rats were less likely to have further seizures later on . Now McClelland et al . , including several of the researchers involved in the 2011 work , have examined what normally happens to the expression of genes after a seizure and what happens when the NRSF transcription factor is blocked . McClelland et al . found that only a small subset\u2014about 10%\u2014of the genes that can theoretically be silenced by NRSF are switched off in the brain when this protein's levels increase after a seizure . The increased NRSF levels , unexpectedly , did not affect the genes that bind tightly to this transcription factor . Nor did NRSF affect genes that bind loosely . Instead , the genes that the transcription factor binds to with an intermediate strength were the ones that were switched off . McClelland et al . suggest that this \u2018mid-range binding\u2019 to NRSF allows the expression of these genes to be increased or decreased in response to there being more or less NRSF in the cell . Genes that bind tightly to NRSF are likely to already have a lot of NRSF bound and are therefore already switched off; and loosely-binding genes would likely need even more NRSF before they are switched off . The subset of genes that were switched off by the increased levels of NRSF after a seizure code for a number of proteins that brain cells need to be able to effectively send and receive messages . Blocking the ability of NRSF to bind to these genes and switch them off may help to prevent the brain changes that cause epilepsy .",

To investigate this question, Roopra et al. used a technique called gene set enrichment analysis to examine the role of an important transcription factor that regulates gene expression. The experiments showed that when a protein called chromatin was blocked by a drug called kainic acid, this increased the levels of some of the genes that are normally regulated by the gene. In contrast, when the protein was not blocked, some genes were not regulated at all. This suggests that the changes in gene activity that trigger seizures may be caused by mutations in other genes, such as genes for ion channels, receptors, and other crucial components of neuronal function. Roopy et. also found that inhibiting the ability of NRSFs to bind to a specific sequence of target genes led to the loss of only a small subset ( \u223c10% ) of those genes being repressed. Further experiments revealed that this was the case for a subset of gene-regulating proteins, which are essential for the cell\u2019s ability to communicate with other cells. Furthermore, these proteins were able to resist the effects of other proteins that were blocked. Finally, in mice that had epilepsy-provoking seizures, they were more sensitive to changes to their genes than those that caused them to become epileptic.

For example , when seeing an object , information about colour and movement are processed by separate types of neurons in the eye . These neurons in turn relay information to different sets of brain areas , all of which are active at the same time . Such parallel processing was originally not thought to apply to information about smell . This was because in mammals , the two types of neurons in the brain area that processes smell seemed to play the same role . However , more recent work suggests that there are in fact differences in the responses of these two neuron types ( called mitral cells and tufted cells ) to odors , suggesting that the brain might use parallel processing for information about smells too . Information travels along neurons in the form of electrical signals , and this activity is often seen in the form of a series of \u201cspikes\u201d . In a process called lateral inhibition , the activity of one neuron can feed back and inhibit the activity of its neighbors . This is important for enhancing contrast; in terms of the sense of smell , lateral inhibition is thought to help distinguish between similar odors . A technique called optogenetics allows the activity of particular neurons in an animal\u2019s brain to be controlled by shining light onto them . Geramita et al . have now used this technique in mice to investigate whether there are differences in how lateral inhibition works in mitral cells and tufted cells . This revealed that lateral inhibition affects mitral cells only when they are spiking at intermediate firing rates , whereas tufted cells are only affected by lateral inhibition when spiking at low firing rates . Using computer simulations , Geramita et al . show that these different responses mean that mitral cells are best at distinguishing similar smells when they are present at high concentrations , while tufted cells are best at distinguishing similar smells that are present at low concentrations . These differences also mean that , by working together , mitral and tufted cells can distinguish between smells much better than either type of neuron on its own . These results demonstrate that , as with the other senses , the brain processes information about smell using parallel pathways .

However, it is not clear how these neurons work together to encode information about specific stimuli.

The experiments show that these projections cells are able to discriminate between different stimuli in different concentrations. In addition, they can also inhibit the firing of other neurons that are involved in similar tasks. This suggests that the cells in these parallel pathways may be responsible for discriminating between similar stimuli at different levels of intensity.

GPCRs are known to form clusters of two or more receptor units , but it is not known if these clusters have unique properties or what role they play in cells . Many drugs can bind to GPCRs and most of them block the activity of the receptors by taking the place of the natural ligand . Another way to alter the activity of a GPCR is with so-called 'allosteric' drugs . These bind to different sites on the receptor than the natural ligands do and can inhibit or enhance binding of the ligands by altering the shape of the receptor . Shivnaraine et al . investigated how a type of GPCR called muscarinic cholinergic receptors interact within clusters . This involved developing a method to track the receptor in mammalian cells using a fluorescent sensor that detects changes in the allosteric site . The experiments show that two or more GPCRs need to interact for the receptors to respond to allosteric drugs in a manner that reflects the normal effect of the drugs on the body . This result is unexpected in light of the assumption that individual receptor molecules act independently . Shivnaraine et al . \u2019s findings indicate that the clusters may play a role in the normal behavior of GPCRs in cells .

These two sites are known as orthostomers and oligomers, but it is not clear how they interact with each other. Kruse et al. have now used a technique called FRET-based microscopy to study the interactions between two different types of receptors. The experiments show that the interaction between the two receptors can be positive or negative, depending on how the receptor interacts with the other receptor. In contrast, the effects of a receptor on an oligomer are not known, and the molecular and supramolecular properties of these interactions are unknown. This is partly because it was not possible to predict how these effects would occur in a cell that has not yet reached equilibrium. To address this question, researchers genetically engineered mice to be able to detect the activity of both receptors at one site on a monomer and another site at an alloster site. When the mice were genetically modified to produce mutant mice that lacked the sensor of conformation, they were unable to distinguish the effect of either site from the one that had been engineered to prevent it from being used in experiments. However, when the experiments were used to test the results of this technique, it became clear that these results were not only positive but also that they arose from interactions within the M2 receptor, which is the prototypic model of allostery. As a result, these findings provide a direct demonstration of how muscaric receptors behave in myocardial preparations. A future challenge will be to understand how this is achieved."

Double-strand breaks\u2014one of the most serious forms of DNA damage\u2014are detected by an enzyme called ATM , and can be repaired in two ways . Bringing the broken strands back together is an obvious method , but it is also error prone . Using templates to generate new DNA to repair the damage is less prone to error , but it can only happen at certain times of the cell cycle . Some cancers are linked to the faulty repair of double-strand breaks . Moreover , a type of kidney cancer called clear cell renal carcinoma is linked to a lack of activity by a protein called p53 , even in individuals who don't have mutations in the gene for this protein . However , many people with this type of cancer have mutations in the gene for a protein called SETD2 . To investigate the links between SETD2 and DNA repair , Carvalho et al . compared cells with and without mutations in the gene for SETD2 . It emerged that SETD2 must be present for DNA repair to take place: the SETD2 modifies the histones so that they can recruit the enzymes that repair the DNA via the template approach ( which is relatively error free ) . SETD2 may be particularly important for repairing damage to genes without introducing errors . Carvalho et al . also show that mutations in SETD2 are sufficient to inactivate p53 . The gene for this protein , which impedes the proliferation of cells with genomic aberrations , such as double-strand breaks , is mutated in most cancers . Overall the results help to illustrate how histone modifications and the DNA damage repair mechanisms and checkpoints work in concert to suppress cancer .",

This revealed that the enzyme is required to activate a gene that encodes a molecule that is essential for DNA repair. In addition to being able to detect and repair the damaged DNA, the enzymes also play a key role in repairing DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ). Previous studies have shown that this enzyme can be activated by other enzymes, but it was unclear whether it also plays a similar role during the same process. Now, Matsuoka and Sato have investigated whether the role of a different enzyme in this process is also played by another gene called p53. These experiments show that P53 is a master guardian of the genome, and that it plays an important role when it comes to repair of D SBs. Further experiments showed that, despite the presence of many other proteins, SETDB2 was not activated in cells that had been exposed to three different drugs. Furthermore, these cells were unable to recognize and rejoin the repaired DNA end, suggesting that SETB2 is needed for this repair to work properly. Overall, this work provides a new way to identify and activate the proteins that are needed to make the repair process more efficient. It may also provide an alternative mechanism for avoiding the need for additional mutations in other genes."

Sometimes these variants have no consequence , but they can be harmful if replacing the correct amino acid with a different amino acid prevents the protein from performing an important task . In particular , missense gene variants in genes that encode immune system proteins are likely to play a role in diseases of the immune system . For example , variants near a gene called Rasgrp1 have been linked to two autoimmune diseases \u2013 type 1 diabetes and Graves\u2019 disease\u2014in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body\u2019s own cells and tissues . Now Daley et al . have shed new light on the mechanism by which a missense gene variant in Rasgrp1 can cause autoimmune diseases . Mice with this mutation show signs of autoimmune disease , but their T cells\u2014white blood cells that have a central role in the immune system \u2013 develop normally despite this mutation . Instead , Daley et al . found that a specific type of T cell , called T helper cells , accumulated in large numbers in the mutant mice and stimulated cells of a third type\u2014immune cells called B cells\u2014to produce autoantibodies . The production of autoantibodies is a common feature of autoimmune diseases . Daley et al . traced the origins of the T helper cells to excessive activity on a signaling pathway that involves a protein called mTOR , and went on to show that treatment with the drug rapamycin counteracted the accumulation of the T helper cells and reduced the level of autoimmune activity . In addition to exemplifying how changing just one amino acid change can have a profound effect , the work of Daley et al . is an attractive model for exploring how missense gene variants in people can contribute to autoimmune diseases .",
        "first_gen": "The human immune system is made up of many different types of cells. One type of cell is called the thymus, which is a region of the body that is responsible for the development of all the cells in our body. A protein called Ras guanine is involved in this process, but it is not known exactly how this protein is activated. It is thought that a mutation in a gene called RASGRP1 leads to the formation of a population of T cells that are dependent on B cells to produce proteins. However, it was not clear how the Rasgrp1 protein works in mice. To investigate this question, Iwig et al. genetically engineered mice to have a missense variant. The mutant mice were genetically modified to be able to carry a missing gene. This mutant mouse had a different set of amino acids than normal mice, and they were more likely to develop autoimmune diseases, such as Graves\u2019 disease, or autoimmune arthritis. These mice also had mutations in the gene that encodes a molecule called mTOR, a protein that binds to receptors on the surface of proteins called T cell receptors. In addition, the mutated mice had an increased activity of another messenger diacylglycerol ( or MTOR for short ) called CD44. Together, these findings suggest that the missing protein may be important for controlling the production of these signals. Further work is now needed to understand the role of this gene in human autoimmune disease."

        "ground_truth": "The pancreas produces many different hormones , as well as several substances important for digestion . To perform these roles , the pancreas contains different types of cells; for example , acinar cells make digestive enzymes that help to break down food . But , like other cells in the body , pancreatic cells can accumulate mutations in their DNA that cause them to divide , acquire an altered identity and form a cancerous tumor . The DNA of cells is packed into a structure called chromatin . While the DNA sequence is essentially the same across all normal cells of a given individual , chromatin can be more or less compacted in the different cell types that comprise our body tissues . A collection of proteins called the SWI/SNF complex can reorganize the chromatin to change how tightly the DNA is packed . This determines which genes in the DNA are accessible and can be activated , and which ones cannot . Around 25% of pancreatic cancers contain mutations in genes that produce proteins of the SWI/SNF complex . These mutations normally occur with an additional mutation that over-activates the gene that produces a potentially cancer-causing protein called Kras . Livshits et al . have now genetically engineered mice to investigate how one such SWI/SNF complex protein , called Arid1a , affects how pancreatic cancer develops using a genetic approach that made possible to temporarily halt the production of Arid1a in acinar cells by feeding these mice an antibiotic . The gene that produces Kras was also over-activated in the pancreases of the mice , making them more likely to develop cancer . Within just two weeks of stopping the production of Arid1a , the acinar cells stopped producing digestive enzymes and started making other proteins that are typically found in cancerous cells , indicating that Arid1a is involved in maintaining the normal identity and activity of these cells . Restoring the ability of altered acinar cells to produce normal levels of Arid1a ( by removing the mice from the antibiotic diet ) did not reverse these changes . Biochemical experiments showed that acinar cells with reduced levels of Arid1a have altered chromatin . In particular , the genes that produce digestive enzymes , which are normally active in healthy pancreases , were less accessible in mice who had over-active Kras and reduced levels of Arid1a . The results presented by Livshits et al . provide the first evidence of how alterations to Arid1a can lead to irreversible changes in the identity and activity of pancreatic acinar cells . These results will need to be carefully considered by researchers who are developing treatments for cancer patients with mutations in Arid1a and other SWI/SNF proteins . In particular , methods that attempt to restore the functions of absent SWI/SNF proteins to cancer cells are unlikely to treat the cancer successfully .",

It is caused by mutations in a gene called SWI/SNF, which controls the activity of a protein called chromatin readers. This protein is found in many different types of cells, including the pancreas and the colon. However, it is not clear how these mutations affect the development of new cancer cells. To investigate this question, Saborowski et al. used a technique called RNA interference ( RNAi ) to genetically engineer mice to produce a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ). The experiments showed that a mutation in an enzyme called KrasG12D affects the ability of the enzyme to interact with other transcription factors. In addition, this enzyme is also known to alter the expression of genes that control the production of other proteins, such as the transcription factor that codes for proteins. Further work is now needed to understand how this process works."

Recent research suggests that young girls are more sensitive to social stress than boys . This could mean that social networks are more important for females in general , and that young females from different species , such as mice , may be more sensitive to social isolation than males . However , few studies have examined how social isolation affects the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones . As such , it remains unknown whether isolating individuals from their social group impacts on the brain in sex-specific ways . Senst , Baimoukhametova et al . now show that the brains of young male and female mice react differently to social isolation . Less than a day after separation from their littermates , the activity in the brain cells of female mice became markedly different from that of isolated males . In contrast to social isolation , the physical stress of being made to swim produced similar changes in the brains of both male and female mice . Further experiments then showed that the changes in the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones required a signalling chemical called corticosterone , which is produced in response to stressful situations . This suggests that , in repsonse to soical isolation , the females are experiencing more stress than the males . Following on from this work , one future challenge will be to investigate if reuniting a social group erases the effects of social isolation on the brain . Further experiments could also examine the behavioural and physiological effects of social isolation , including how females respond to later stressful events .",
        "first_gen": "Many species use social networks to buffer the effects of stress. For example, some species, such as humans, rely on social support and group dynamics to cope with stressful situations. However, it is also important for survival to be able to adapt to changes in the environment. To do so, the hypothalamus releases a hormone called corticotropin releasing hormone ( CRH ) into the brain. This hormone is produced by a group of cells called hypothalamic pituitary cells ( PVNs ), which are involved in regulating the release of hormones. These cells release hormones in response to stress, but they do not release them in a sexually dimorphic fashion. Now, Wamsteeker Cusulin et al. have investigated whether social isolation alters the activity of the nerve cells in PVNs in female mice. The experiments show that isolating the cells from their mates for longer periods of time alters their ability to release the hormone. In the experiments, female and male mice were housed in same-sex groups and isolated from littermates for sixteen to eighteen hours. Mice were then treated with a chemical called metyrapone and then subjected to a series of experiments in which they were exposed to an acute physical stress ( swim ). When the mice had access to drinking water, they had longer first spike latency ( FSL ) and a decrease in their excitability of CRN neurons. Further experiments showed that the same chemical was present in both male and female cells, and that it was not necessary for these changes to occur in either male or female cell types. Furthermore, when the animals were separated, these cells were more sensitive to the stress than those found in male cells. Overall, this suggests that, in comparison to males, females are more likely to respond to stressful stimuli than males. Future work will be needed to investigate whether these findings are consistent with the findings of previous studies."

        "ground_truth": "In humans and other mammals , a protein in the blood called hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body . This protein contains four subunits that can each bind to one molecule of oxygen , so a single hemoglobin can carry up to four oxygen molecules at the same time . Previous studies have found that , although each subunit can potentially bind oxygen on its own , the subunits actually work together to help each other bind to oxygen in the body . Two biochemical properties of hemoglobin affect how it carries oxygen molecules . First , oxygen-binding affinity , or how tightly the protein can bind to oxygen; and secondly cooperativity , or the degree to which the subunits interact with each other to bind oxygen more tightly . Mammals of different shapes and sizes have different requirements for transporting oxygen from the lungs to organ tissues , which have shaped their hemoglobin proteins over evolutionary timescales . While the contribution of affinity to hemoglobin evolution in animals of different sizes has been addressed in the past , the role of cooperativity in hemoglobin adapting to body size has remained unclear . Here , Rapp and Yifrach used a mathematical approach to analyze existing data from 14 different mammals \u2013 including mice , sheep , humans and elephants \u2013 on how oxygen binds to hemoglobin . Using this approach , they were able to explain why different mammalian hemoglobins present different oxygen-binding affinity and cooperativity values . Furthermore , they demonstrated that the cooperativity values were very close to the maximum they could be for each version of hemoglobin . These findings suggest that , as mammals evolved , genetic mutations that altered the oxygen-binding affinity or the ability of hemoglobin subunits to cooperate may have allowed hemoglobin proteins to adapt to meet the oxygen needs of mammals of different sizes and shapes . In the future , the approach used by Rapp and Yifrach could be adapted to study how other proteins that bind molecules in a cooperative manner have evolved .",
        "first_gen": "A protein called hemoglobin ( or Hb for short ) is an important model protein to study how animals adapt to changes in their body size, lifestyle and/or environment. Hemoglobin is a protein that binds to oxygen in the lungs and cooperates with other proteins to deliver oxygen to the body. However, it is not clear how this mechanism works in vertebrates. To investigate this question, Rapp, Yifrach et al. used a technique called the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model to investigate the molecular properties of the protein. The experiments revealed that the two factors that determine how much and how efficiently the proteins bind to each other are different for different animals. In particular, the molecules binding to different proteins have different degrees of cooperativity and affinity, which are known as the Hill coefficients. This means that when an animal\u2019s body is large, its oxygen is delivered to its tissues in a way that allows it to absorb oxygen more efficiently than it would if it were smaller. Rapp and Yefrich then used the same model and graphed the values of both affinity and coativity of hemophilia to show that these two properties are indeed different in mammals. These findings reveal the evolutionary and physiological mechanisms underlying the evolution of these properties. Further work is now needed to understand how these mechanisms work in humans and other animals, and to develop a better understanding of how they work."

        "ground_truth": "Malaria remains a devastating disease in many parts of the world . Malaria parasites enter the host via the skin , where they are deposited by infected mosquitoes as they look for blood . The parasites must exit the skin to reach the liver , where they multiply and ultimately infect red blood cells , where they cause the symptoms of the disease . In the skin , the parasites must move to find blood vessels that they enter to travel via the blood circulation to the liver . Only about 10\u201320% of parasites make it out of the skin , making this a bottleneck for the parasite . Scientists have been working to develop vaccines that would protect people against malaria . One way these could work would be to stop malaria parasites from leaving the skin and entering the blood vessels . But to do that , more needs to be learnt about how the parasites move in the skin and enter the blood vessels . Hopp et al . , using a mouse model of malaria , created malaria parasites that produce a fluorescent protein that allows the parasites to be tracked after they have been injected into the skin of a mouse's ear . This revealed that the parasites have two ways of moving . After first being injected , the parasites move quickly and freely . The parasites slow down when they come close to a blood vessel and move on or around the vessel for some time before entering it . During this stage of movement , the parasites tend to move in paths that follow the curvature of the blood vessels , which may improve how well they make contact with the blood vessel surface and may enable them to find the areas of the vessels best suited for entry . Next , Hopp et al . investigated how two parasite mutants move through mouse skin . Both mutants had previously been found to be less likely than wild-type parasites to exit the inoculation site . Hopp et al . found that one of the mutants moves slowly after being injected and so explores a smaller tissue volume than normal and encounters fewer blood vessels . The second mutant parasite spends more time than normal moving on the surface of the blood vessels , but finds it difficult to enter them . Continuing this work will allow us to learn more about the interactions between the parasite and the blood vessels , which in turn could reveal key events that could be targeted by a vaccine . Furthermore , the significant amount of time that the parasites spend moving and looking for blood vessels in the skin could be a good time to target them with antibodies and prevent malaria infection .",
        "first_gen": "Malaria is an infection caused by a parasite called Plasmodium sporozoites. The parasite infects the skin of the infected animal, which is then infected with malaria. This infection starts with the bite of an infected mosquito, and the parasite then travels through the body to infect the host\u2019s blood vessels. During the infection, the parasites move in a circular pattern, but they are unable to enter the bloodstream. It is thought that this is due to the speed at which these parasites are moving. However, it is not clear how these movements occur. To investigate this question, Ejigiri et al. used microscopy to study the movement of parasites in the blood of infected mice. In the experiments, mice were injected with a drug called anti-CD31. When the drug was injected into the mice, they were able to move faster than normal. Further experiments showed that these mice had two types of motility: high speed and less confinement, while in areas far from blood vessel activity. These mice also had mutations in key adhesive proteins that allow them to travel in more constrained paths. Furthermore, when the drugs were given to mice that had been injected directly into their bloodstream, these animals were less likely to pass through blood-sucking vessels, suggesting that the virus was more restricted in its ability to exit from the dermis. More work is now needed to understand how this happens."

Very different organisms can share many of the same modules because certain abilities are fundamental to the survival of all cells and so they have been retained over the course of evolution . That said , these modules may not necessarily involve the same genes because it is often possible to achieve the same result using different components . One way to study how those modules can diversify is to deliberately disrupt one of the genes in a module , and observe how the organism and its descendants respond over many generations . Other genes in these organisms may acquire genetic mutations that enable the genes to take on the role of the missing protein . However , the removal of a single component can be detrimental to the survival of the organisms or may affect many different processes . This can make it difficult to understand what is going on . A gene called BEM1 is crucial for yeast cells to establish polarity , that is , to allow the different sides of a cell to become distinct from one another . This activity is essential for the yeast to replicate itself . Previous studies have shown that the BEM1 gene had a different role in other species of fungi , which suggests that yeast may have other genes that previously assumed the role that BEM1 does now . In this study , Laan et al . removed BEM1 from yeast and allowed the population of mutant cells to evolve for a thousand generations . The approach differs from previous studies because Laan et al . deliberately selected for yeast that had acquired multiple genetic mutations that can together almost fully compensate for the loss of BEM1 . Initially , the mutant cells grew very slowly , were abnormal in shape and likely to burst open . However , by the end of the experiment , the cells were able to grow almost as well as the original yeast cells had before the gene deletion . Genetic analysis revealed that the deletion of BEM1 triggers the inactivation of other genes that are also involved in the regulation of polarity , which largely restored the ability of the disrupted polarity module to work . This restoration follows a \u2018reproducible trajectory\u2019 , as the same genes were switched off in the same order in different populations of yeast that were studied at the same time . The work is an example of reproducible evolution , whereby a specific order of changes to gene activity repeatedly enables cells with severe defects in important processes to adapt and restore a gene module , using whatever components they have left . The next challenge will be to understand how the particular roles of important modules affect their adaptability .",
        "first_gen": "Cells are organized by a structure called the polarity gene, which is responsible for the polarization of the cell membrane. When a cell divides, it switches on a protein called GTPase. This protein is essential for polarization, but it is also important for other functions, such as cell wall growth and cell division. It is not clear how cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. To investigate this question, Kvitek et al. sequenced the genomes of thousands of yeast cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments revealed that the cells evolved to be polarized in a way that allowed them to grow more quickly than their ancestors. However, the mutations that caused the changes in polarization did not occur in all species. Instead, mutations in one gene called BEM1 caused cells to rapidly increase in fitness and then slowly decrease in their fitness. These results suggest that cells are able to adapt to changing requirements and to respond to the chance loss of a particular gene. In the future, these findings could lead to a better understanding of how the evolution of cell polarization and movement occurs."

        "ground_truth": "Humans , in general , are not particularly good at making economic decisions . People can be influenced by unhelpful biases: such as \u2018loss aversion\u2019 where a person views losses as more significant than gains . Sometimes these biases stop us making the decisions that offer the best reward , as such , they raise the question: why do these biases exist at all ? One way to examine this question is by looking at the brain activity of people making economic decisions . Two regions near the front of the brain are known to be involved in human decision-making in response to rewards . However , many researchers disagree as to what these two regions are actually doing when we make economic decisions . Much of the research in this area has asked participants to essentially gamble on a series of independent events , which typically provide a one-off instant reward with no further positive consequences . However , these tasks do not accurately reflect real economic decisions . In real life situations , people tend to take time to make a decision , and weigh up the potential long-term costs and benefits of an investment . Indeed the decision itself may be deferred until enough information is gathered; for example , very few people would choose to buy a house on the spur of the moment . Now Tsetsos et al . have attempted to bridge the gap between previous studies and everyday experiences by designing a task that encompasses many of the factors involved in real life decision-making . In this task , participants were given the option of deciding whether to commit to , or reject , an investment opportunity immediately; or to choose to defer making the decision until later\u2014similar to how a person might wait to view different properties before deciding which house to buy . Using brain imaging , Tsetsos et al . found that one of the two brain regions ( called the dorsal ACC for short ) was involved in weighing up the cost of rejecting an offer , but not accepting it . The other region ( called the rostromedial prefrontal cortex or rmPFC ) was involved in assessing the value of an offer only when the participant decided to defer making a decision , and not when they decided to commit . Furthermore , by using computer simulations , Tsetsos et al . found that , with this more realistic task , biases such as loss aversion were in fact beneficial and helped participants to make decisions that increased their financial payoff . This suggests that the \u2018unhelpful biases\u2019 often seen in traditional decision making tasks may be a result of participants\u2019 real life strategies failing to work when applied to an artificial situation . In other words , perhaps humans are not so bad at economic decision-making after all .",
        "first_gen": "Many people make choices that enhance their chances of positive reinforcement. For example, when deciding whether to invest in a house or choosing a partner, people often make successive, independent choices about which type of reward they would like to receive. However, these decisions often have lasting consequences, such as when making a decision about whether or not to buy a new car. In many cases, the decision is made in anticipation of receiving a long-term financial return. Yet, it is not clear how the brain processes these choices in the same way. Now, Kolling et al. have investigated this question using a task in which volunteers were asked to choose between two different types of rewards. The volunteers chose between either accepting or rejecting one of the two rewards, or to accept the other reward, and to decide which of these rewards was more likely to be received later in life. When the volunteers made a choice between acceptance or rejection, they had two choices: accept or reject. Accepting the reward and rejecting it were both decisions that resulted in sustained financial returns for many years into the future. Conversely, rejection and acceptance were decisions made only when the participants had already received a reward. These findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex plays a key role in decision-making, but it remains unclear how this process works."

        "ground_truth": "Many biological features of animals , including body temperature and hormone levels , follow daily rhythms that repeat every 24 hours . These so-called circadian rhythms are driven by an internal body clock and are essential for the organism to adapt to the daily cycle of light and dark . Circadian rhythms also take place inside individual cells \u2013 for example , the amount of a given protein in a cell often rises and falls over each 24-hour period . To generate these daily fluctuations , the processes used to make proteins based on the instructions encoded within a gene must be carefully controlled . Genes are first copied or \u2018transcribed' into intermediate molecules called messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) . These mRNA molecules must then travel out of the cell\u2019s nucleus before they can be de-coded to produce proteins . This means that daily fluctuations in mRNA and protein levels could occur because the rate at which the DNA is transcribed fluctuates or because controlling the steps that occur after transcription . However it is not clear how much these post-transcriptional steps contribute to circadian rhythms inside cells . Recently , structures called paraspeckles were seen inside the nucleus . These structures are made from a long RNA molecule that does not code for a protein , and a number of proteins that can bind mRNA molecules . Paraspeckles are thought to prevent certain mRNAs from leaving the nucleus and therefore stop them from being decoded to make proteins . Torres et al . have now investigated whether paraspeckles may play a role in circadian rhythms . Torres et al . looked at the long non-coding RNA and several proteins that are known to be components of paraspeckles in cells taken from the pituitary glands of rats using a variety of techniques . These cells were chosen because they were known to have a working circadian clock . The analysis showed that the levels of these components , as well as the number of paraspeckles within the nucleus , changed over the course of a daily cycle . Torres et al . then confirmed that mRNAs containing a sequence that is known to recruit mRNAs to paraspeckes ( the IRAlu sequence ) could be also retained in the nucleus or released with a circadian rhythm . This pattern was lost when the paraspeckles were disrupted . These findings suggest that daily fluctuations in protein levels can be post-transcriptionally controlled by paraspeckles rhythmically retaining mRNAs in the nucleus . Future studies could explore whether it may be possible to control circadian rhythms by targeting the paraspeckles , which could help to improve conditions where the internal body clock goes wrong .",
        "first_gen": "The circadian clock is the biological clock that controls the activity of the body\u2019s genes. The circadian clocks are a group of proteins that are found in the nucleus of a cell, called the pituitary. These proteins are made up of long noncoding RNA molecules called RNA-binding proteins ( or RNAs for short ). When a gene is transcribed, the RNA is copied into a protein called Neat1, which is then passed on to the next gene. This process is known as transcriptional control, but it is not fully understood how these proteins control gene expression. Now, Guillaumond et al. have used fluorescent microscopy to study the expression patterns of many of these RNA proteins. They found that all the proteins involved in gene transcription were retained in their nucleoplasm, while only a small number of other proteins, including four major proteins and a transcription factor called IRAlu, were also retained. However, it was not clear how the nuclear retention of RNA RNA was controlled by the same nuclear bodies. To investigate this further, guillaamond and Fox used a technique called artificial light microscopes to observe the production of mRNA in pituitsary cells. In the experiments, all four proteins were kept in a nuclear body that was arranged in such a way that they were able to retain their RNA in place. Further experiments showed that this was the case for all proteins on the mRNA that had been lost when the gene was disrupted. Furthermore, when a single RNA molecule was inserted into the mitochondria, this RNA retained its RNA for a long period of time. Overall, these findings suggest that the circadian rhythms of cells are regulated by a set of molecular clocks that regulate gene activity at a post-transcriptional level. It is also possible that these clocks may also be regulated in other cells, such as the pancreas, liver and other organs."

Instead , the signals trigger the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters , which then stimulate a corresponding electrical signal in a neighboring neuron . Inside the neuron , the neurotransmitters are packaged into structures called vesicles and are released across the synapse when the vesicle merges with the cell membrane at a location called the active zone . Calcium ions move through proteins known as calcium channels , which are embedded in the neuron's cell membrane in the active zone , and cause the vesicle to merge with the neuron's membrane and release its contents into the synapse . A protein called Munc13 is also important for helping to release neurotransmitters , which it does by binding to various other proteins in the active zone known to be critical for the process of allowing the vesicle and cell membranes to merge . Now , Calloway et al . have found that Munc13 also interacts with the calcium channels . The experiments used genetic tools to eliminate or mutate Munc13 in rat neurons . Electrical impulses were then applied to these neurons and the flow of calcium ions was monitored at the synapses . The results showed that Munc13 controls when the calcium channels open and close in response to nerve impulses . Further experiments revealed the specific region of the Munc13 protein that interacts with the calcium channels . Mutations to this part of Munc13 affected the ability of the calcium channels to open and close . The results indicate that active zone proteins such as Munc13 can potentially play multiple roles in controlling neurotransmitter release . It seems unlikely that Munc13 is the only calcium channel partner that helps sculpt information transfer at synapses . Future studies could investigate how multiple partners work together to determine the behavior of calcium channels in specific locations and at specific times , and how this interplay affects how well synapses work in the brain .",

However, it is not clear how this activity is controlled. To investigate this question, Rangaraju et al. studied mice, flies, worms and worms that have mutations that prevent them from being able to produce a mutant version of this protein. This mutant mutant protein was found to have a different role in synapses, but it was not known how it controls the activity at nerve terminals. Now, using a technique called heterologous expression systems to study the effects of these mutations on synapse activity in mice and flies has revealed that a mutation in a gene that encodes the gene for this gene controls how neurons respond to voltage-gated calcium channels. In the experiments, the mutant gene was removed from the neurons and replaced with a modified version that had two basic residues in it that were identical to those found on other mutant proteins. Further experiments showed that this mutant mutation alters the behavior of neurons when they are exposed to high-frequency electrical signals, such as bursts of electrical activity. Moreover, this mutation also alters how the cells respond when the voltage is applied to the nerve cell membrane. Together, these findings show that the mutations in these mutant neurons are a novel form of synaptic modulation that could be used to change the way neurons communicate. Future studies are needed to investigate whether this type of modulation is also possible in humans and other animals."

Their internal pressure can be higher than the pressure in a car tire . It is this pressure that gives non-woody plant tissue its shape . Take away the pressure , and the plant wilts . The pressure inside a cell creates a lot of mechanical stress on the epidermal cell walls \u2013 those that make up the surface of the plant . The extent of the stress depends on the shape and size of the cells; for example , large cells bulge out and experience more stress than small cells . This could mean that the shape of puzzle cells is an adaptation used by plants to reduce the stress on their surface . To investigate this possibility , Sapala , Runions et al . developed a computer simulation that models how a plant grows and re-creates a variety of realistic puzzle cell shapes . The simulations show that \u2018paving\u2019 the leaf surface with puzzle shaped cells instead of more regularly shaped cells reduces the stress in the epidermal cell walls . Counterintuitively , the simulations also show that complex puzzle shapes develop in parts of the plant that grow isotropically ( uniformly in all directions ) , such as leaves . If a plant organ grows mostly in one direction , like in a root or stem , long thin cells are sufficient to reduce the stress on the epidermal cell wall . Sapala , Runions et al . tested this idea by analyzing the shape of organs and cells in many plant species and by genetically modifying growth directions in Arabidopsis thaliana plants . This confirmed that puzzle cell shape is related to both organ shape and how isotropically the plant grows . It had previously been proposed that mobile chemical signals passed between cells coordinate the process by which a lobe in one puzzle cell matches an indentation in its neighbor . However , the model developed by Sapala , Runions et al . does not require such chemical signaling . Instead , mechanical forces and the shape the puzzle cells themselves may transmit this information . Mechanical forces are known to have important effects on the shape and behavior of cells from other species too .

The shape of these cells depends on the size of the cell wall, and it has been suggested that the shape and function of a puzzle cell are closely related. However, it is not clear how these shapes are formed. To investigate this question, Majda et al. used computer simulations to simulate the shapes of puzzle-shaped cells grown in a plant organ called Arabidopsis thaliana. This revealed that, when the cells were growing in two directions, the outermost part of each cell was larger than the innermost cell. When the growth of this organ was less than 1 centimeter, this made it easier for cells to divide and expand. In the same way, if a cell grows in one direction and expands in another direction, that cell would shrink under the stress produced by the expansion of its outer layer. As a result, cells would become larger and larger, which would reduce the amount of cellulose and other wall material required to maintain the tissue's integrity. Further experiments showed that a mechanism called the \u2018lobeyness\u2019 mechanism helps to prevent the formation of such shapes. It was also possible to test this hypothesis by using computer simulation models that simulate how cells grow at the cellular level. By using these simulations in plants and animals that have been genetically engineered to be more flexible than normal, these findings may help scientists to better understand how plants grow and evolve."

This DNA segment is organized in modules , with coding sections separated by portions of non-coding DNA known as introns . When a gene is \u2018turned on\u2019 , it gets faithfully copied into a molecule of pre-messenger RNA ( pre-mRNA ) , which contains the alternating coding and non-coding modules . Before it can serve as a template to create a protein , this pre-mRNA must be processed and all the introns removed by a structure called the spliceosome . If this delicate process goes wrong , inaccurate protein templates are produced that may be damaging for the cell . Spliceosomes are precise molecular \u2018scissors\u2019 that can recognize where a coding module stops and an intron starts , and then make a snip in the pre-mRNA to remove the non-coding sequence . The spliceosome is a complex molecular machine formed of numerous parts \u2013 including one known as U1 snRNP \u2013 that must come together . When a pre-mRNA has several introns , a spliceosome assembles anew for each of them . Braun et al . designed a new method that allows them to \u2018tag\u2019 spliceosomes extracted from a human cell and follow them as they come together . The experiments show that spliceosomes working on different introns in the same pre-mRNA actually help each other out . As one assembles , this helps the spliceosome that processes the neighboring intron to get built . In particular , the U1 snRNPs processing nearby introns collaborate to promote the assembly and activity of the spliceosomes . This teamwork is likely important to guarantee that multiple introns are cut out quickly and accurately .",
        "first_gen": "Most human genes contain multiple introns and short exons. Each of these is known as a spliceosome, which is made up of a group of proteins called pre-mRNAs. These proteins can be recognized by other proteins, such as the U1, U2, and U3. However, it is not clear how these proteins interact with each other to form the splicesosomes. To investigate this question, Roca et al. used a technique called colocalization single molecule spectroscopy ( CoSMoS ) to study how the two processes work together in human cells. The experiments showed that the cross-intron pathway recognizes and binds to a single RNA molecule, but it does not recognize the other RNA molecules that are present at the same time. In addition, the co-interactions between the different subcomplexes are important for the formation of the new splicing proteins. This is because the interactions between these two proteins are known to be important in the assembly of multi-inucleoproteins. It is also unclear how this process works in humans, where the three-dimensional structure of DNA is poorly understood. Here, S. cerevisiae extracts were grown in a laboratory and used to investigate the mechanisms by which the human nuclear extracts can assemble single pre\u2013mRNA molecules. First, a fluorescent tag was tagged with a protein that is found on the surface of one of three pre mRNA molecules, while another tag is tagged on another mRNA molecule that contains a different protein. Together, these experiments show that two different types of RNA are involved in assembling the pre\u2014splicesome. Further experiments revealed that both the RNA and the tag can interact in different ways, with the first binding occurring at different locations on each mRNA, whereas the second binding occurs at other sites. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these interactions could help to develop new treatments for cancer and other diseases that affect the immune system."

Like all machines , their ability to work properly depends on their three-dimensional shape and structure . To make proteins , building blocks called amino acids are first assembled into a string that , like wool in a sweater , needs to be knitted into the final three-dimensional structure . How proteins reach their 3D structure is called \u201cfolding\u201d , and when protein folding fails , or is not so efficient , it can cause very severe diseases . Protein folding is not as nicely progressive as knitting a sweater: it is more like putting all the wool into a big messy blob that then suddenly turns into a protein with the right three-dimensional structure . Cells have machinery that can detect messy-looking molecules and destroy them . Therefore , new proteins need to be hidden from this machinery until they have finished folding . A human protein called LRP6 is found on the surface of cells and it plays an important role in allowing cells to communicate with each other . Like many other proteins , LRP6 is produced inside the cell in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum and is then exported to the cell surface . In 2008 , a team of researchers found that LRP6 is modified in a particular way known as S-palmitoylation before it leaves the endoplasmic reticulum . This suggested that there is a system that helps this protein to fold correctly . Here Perrody , Abrami et al . \u2013 including some of the researchers from the previous work \u2013 used biochemical techniques to investigate how LRP6 folds . The experiments show that another type of protein modification that involves attaching a molecule called ubiquitin to LRP6 promotes this protein\u2019s folding . Once the protein is folded , the ubiquitin is removed from LRP6 by an enzyme called USP19 . Further experiments show that this system also helps to ensure that two other important proteins fold correctly . The next steps following on from this work are to identify the other molecules involved in this protein folding system . A future challenge is to find out how this system protects new proteins from being degraded while they are still folding .",
        "first_gen": "Proteins are made of a membrane protein called the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ). The ER is a region of the cell membrane that is responsible for the production of proteins. When a protein is made, it needs to be folded in three places: the cytosolic side, the membrane side and the extracellular side. To fold proteins, proteins must first pass through a process called palmitoylation. This process involves a group of enzymes and chaperones that help the protein to fold. These enzymes are called ubiquitins, which are involved in the folding process. However, when the proteins are not folded correctly, they can be destroyed by other enzymes, such as the enzyme USP19. In the case of ER proteins that are folded incorrectly, this can lead to a disease called Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator ( LRP6 ), a type of cystic fibrosis that causes muscle atrophy in patients with the disease. It was previously thought that the ER was a better place to produce proteins than it is now. Now, Abrami et al. have shown that this is not true. Instead, an enzyme is needed to remove a specific lysine from the E-terminus, and this enzyme helps to ensure that a sufficient number of active proteins reach their final destination. UUPITIN is also a key player in this process, but it was not clear how it controls the activity of these enzymes."

However , in an uncertain situation , this decision process requires balancing two competing priorities: exploiting options that are expected to be rewarding ( exploitation ) , and exploring alternatives that could be more valuable ( exploration ) . Decision making and exploration are disrupted in many mental disorders , some of which can differ in either presentation or risk of development across women and men . This raises the question of whether sex differences in exploration and exploitation could contribute to the vulnerability to these conditions . To shed light on this question , Chen et al . studied exploration in male and female mice as they played a video game . The mice had the option to touch one of two locations on a screen for a chance to win a small reward . The likelihood of success was different between the two options , and so the mice were incentivized to determine which was the more rewarding button . While the mice were similarly successful in finding rewards regardless of sex , on average male mice were more likely to keep exploring between the options while female mice more quickly gained confidence in an option . These differences were stronger during uncertain periods of learning and exploration than when making choices in a well-known situation , indicating that periods of uncertainty are when the influence of sex on cognition are most visible . However , not every female or male mouse was the same \u2013 there was as much variability within a sex as was seen between sexes . These results indicate that sex mechanisms , along with many other influences cause individual differences in the cognitive processes important for decision making . The approach used by Chen et al . could help to study individual differences in cognition in other species , and shed light on how individual differences in decision-making processes could contribute to risk and resilience to mental disorders .",

For example, some people may struggle to make decisions when they are available, while others may find it difficult to do so. This is partly because the brain processes that control decision making are different in different people. In addition, it is not clear how sex influences the decision-making process. To address this question, Grissom et al. trained male and female mice on a classic value-based decision task. The experiments showed that both males and females made the same amount of exploration, even if they were more likely to get \u2018stuck\u2019 in the task than in stable choices. However, when the mice were given a choice to explore, they learned more quickly than their stable counterparts. These findings suggest that sex may be a major source of errors in decisions, but it remains unclear how these errors are caused by differences in behavior. Using computational tools to quantify the effects of sex differences on decisions made by mice, the researchers used a technique called a Hidden Markov model to measure how well the animals responded to the choices they had been given. When the experiments were repeated, both groups of mice performed better at making choices than the stable ones. Overall, these findings show that the results of these experiments reveal how much sex is involved in decisionmaking. Further work is now needed to understand how this process is affected by sex."

Each organelle is composed of a unique set of proteins and performs specific roles in the cell . The endoplasmic reticulum , or ER for short , is an organelle where many proteins are produced . Most of these proteins are then released from the cell or sorted to other organelles . The ER has a strict quality control system that ensures any faulty proteins are quickly marked for the cell to destroy . However , the destruction process itself does not happen in the ER , so faulty proteins first need to leave this organelle . This is achieved by a group of proteins known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation machinery ( or ERAD for short ) . To extract a faulty protein from the ER , proteins of the ER and outside the ER cooperate . First , an ERAD protein called Doa10 attaches a small protein tag called ubiquitin to the faulty proteins to mark them for destruction . Then , outside of the ER , a protein called Cdc48 \u2018grabs\u2019 the ubiquitin tag and pulls . But that is only part of the story . Many of the proteins made by the ER have tethers that anchor them firmly to the membrane , making them much harder to remove . To get a better idea of how the extraction works , Schmidt et al . rebuilt the ERAD machinery in a test tube . This involved purifying proteins from yeast and inserting them into artificial membranes , allowing closer study of each part of the process . This revealed that attaching ubiquitin tags to faulty proteins is only one part of Doa10's role; it also participates in the extraction itself . Part of Doa10 resides within the membrane , and this \u2018membrane-spanning domain\u2019 can interact with faulty proteins , loosening their membrane anchors . At the same time , Cdc48 pulls from the outside . This pulling force causes the faulty proteins to unfold , allowing them to pass through the membrane . Given these findings , the next step is to find out exactly how Doa10 works by looking at its three-dimensional structure . This could have implications not only for the study of ERAD , but of similar quality control processes in other organelles too . A build-up of faulty proteins can cause diseases like neurodegeneration , so understanding how cells remove faulty proteins could help future medical research .",

ERAD removes misfolded, unassembled and mistargeted proteins by pulling on polyubiquitinated proteins, which are then degraded by the proteasome. However, it is not clear how these proteins are pulled across the cytosol, or how they are extracted. To find out, Guo et al. used a technique called a reconstituted system of proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the role of a protein called Cdc48. The experiments showed that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 is involved in this process, but it was not known how this enzyme works. In the experiments, the proteins were packaged in a way that made it possible for the enzyme to pull on a polymer-embedded protein. When the enzymes were mixed with purified proteins they were able to move the protein across and extract it. These experiments also revealed that this protein is pulled on by a membrane protein that is folded into a \u201ctranslocase\u201d that pulls on the polymer embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. Further experiments show that a similar protein, called D-4/MARCH6, plays an important role in pulling the transmembane proteins across.

These chemical signals act over a wide area , and the amount of signal each cell receives typically initiates a sequence of events that spatially pattern the multiple cells of an organ or tissue . One of the most well-studied groups of morphogens are the hedgehog proteins , which are involved in the development of many animals , ranging from flies to humans . In fruit flies , hedgehog proteins kickstart a cascade of molecular changes that switch on a set of 'target' genes . They do this by ultimately altering the activity of a protein called cubitus interruptus , which comes in two lengths: a long version called Ci-155 and a short version called Ci-75 . When hedgehog is absent , Ci-155 is kept in an inactive state in the cytoplasm , where it is slowly converted into its shorter form , Ci-75: this repressor protein is then able to access the nucleus , where it switches \u2018off\u2019 the target genes . However , when a hedgehog signal is present , the processing of Ci into its shorter form is inhibited . Instead , Ci-155 becomes activated by a separate mechanism that allows the long form protein to enter the nucleus and switch \u2018on\u2019 the target genes . But it was unclear whether hedgehog requires both of these mechanisms in order to act as a morphogen and regulate the activity of developmental genes . To answer this question , Little et al . mutated the gene for Ci in the embryo of fruit flies , so that the Ci-155 protein could no longer be processed into Ci-75 . Examining the developing wings of these flies revealed that the genes targeted by hedgehog are still activated in the correct pattern . In some parts of the wing , Ci-75 is required to switch off specific sets of genes . But when Little et al . blocked these genes , by adding a gene that constantly produces the Ci repressor in the presence or absence of hedgehog , the adult flies still developed normally structured wings . This suggests that hedgehog does not need to regulate the processing of Ci-155 into Ci-75 in order to perform its developmental role . Previous work showed that when one of the major mechanisms used by hedgehog to activate Ci-155 is blocked , fruit flies are still able to develop normal wings . Taken together with the findings of Little et al . , this suggests that the two mechanisms induced by hedgehog can compensate for each other , and independently regulate the development of the fruit fly wing . These mechanisms , which are also found in humans , have been linked to birth defects and several common types of cancer , and understanding how they work could help the development of new treatments .",
        "first_gen": "Embryonic Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling proteins help to control the development of adult tissues in both invertebrates and vertebrates. These proteins are found in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which is one of the most common causes of birth defects and cancer. In fruit flies, HH signals to a group of cells at the anterior-posterior border with declining strength from posterior to anterior. This region is known as Cubitus Interruptus ( Ci ), and it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of this pathway in order to develop new treatments for these disorders. However, it was not clear what role Ci plays in this process. Now, Garcia-Garcia et al. have used a technique called CRISPR-Cas9 to investigate the role of Ci in developing wing discs in flies. The experiments showed that a protein called Escherichia coli ( or Ci for short ) binds to the Ci protein and activates it, but not the full-length Ci or Gli proteins. When Ci is activated, Ci-155 protein levels are elevated to uniformly high levels in anterior wing disc cells, suggesting that it can signal normally in a normal setting. Further experiments revealed that the activity of other proteins, such as PKA and Cos2, is also regulated by Ci. By contrast, the levels of some of these proteins were not regulated in normal conditions. Furthermore, when Ci was activated in response to Ci, this protein was more likely to signal normal wing shape than it would have been in cells that lacked it. Together, these findings suggest that Ci can regulate the production of Hhog proteins in an appropriate way. Future studies will also be needed to test the effects of different proteins on the ability of ci-null cells to communicate with each other."

Day-to-day pain like a stubbed toe or a pricked finger is called acute pain . It alerts the body to harm but only lasts a short time and usually goes away on its own . Pain that persists more than three months after the damaged tissue has healed is known as chronic pain , and it is a serious problem that is often difficult to treat . Learning more about the causes of chronic pain is necessary to help develop more effective therapies . Nerve pathways in the spinal cord help process pain and other sensory information from the skin and relay it to the brain . These pathways include sensory fibers that carry pain information from the body to the spinal cord , as well as cells that relay this information to the brain . But not much is known about how the nerves and cells in this region prioritize or refine sensory information before sending it to the brain . Now , Smith et al . have used mice to show that nerve cells in the spinal cord that produce the protein calretinin can act as a pain amplifier , causing it to persist . A technique called optogenetics was used to turn on calretinin nerve cells by exposing them to light . This caused the mice to behave like they were in pain even though they had not been harmed , and the behaviour stopped when they were treated with morphine , a powerful painkiller . Further experiments showed that calretinin nerve cells form a highly interconnected network in the spinal cord . These results show that calretinin nerve cells can \u2018jump-start\u2019 the pain pathway within the spinal cord , even when there is no painful stimulation of the skin . Turning on these cells even briefly causes behaviours associated with prolonged pain .

To address this problem, Peirs et al. used a technique called optogenetics to selectively activate neurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin ( CR ). This allowed the neurons to communicate with each other in a way that was not previously known. The experiments showed that the interneurons in this region are involved in signaling to other neurons in the same region. In addition, the researchers found that these neurons were able to send signals to a group of nerve cells that were not excitatory. Further experiments revealed that this group is important for the generation and amplification of pain. Furthermore, it was also possible to detect the activity of calcium ions in these cells, and to activate them in response to light and other sensory signals.

A genetic disease called Carpenter syndrome causes the bones of the skull to fuse early in life , stopping it from growing correctly . Carpenter syndrome is often caused by changes to the gene responsible for making a protein called RAB23 . RAB23 helps move other molecules and cell components between different parts of the cell , and is therefore involved in a number of cellular processes . Previous studies suggest that RAB23 has a role in many parts of the body during development . Yet , it is unclear which cells in the skull depend on RAB23 activity and how this protein is controlled . To answer this question , Hasan et al . grew pieces of developing skull bones that had been taken from mice lacking the RAB23 protein in the laboratory . Examining these samples revealed that RAB23 is active in cells called osteoblasts that add new bone to the edge of each piece of the skull as it grows . Hasan et al . also found that RAB23 regulates two cellular signaling pathways \u2013 called the hedgehog pathway and the fibroblast growth factor pathway \u2013 that interact with one another and co-ordinate skull development .

Carpenter syndrome is caused by a mutation in a gene that encodes a protein called RAB23. This protein is involved in several steps in cell development, including the formation of the suture and the movement of bones. In the early stages of this process, cells called progenitor cells proliferate and differentiate, while the stem cells at the back of these cells divide and divide to make new cells. However, when a cell divides, the cells that make up the cell are unable to divide properly. The resulting defects can lead to a condition called Carpenter Syndrome, which is characterized by the premature fusion of a craniofacial skull and a loss of bone growth. To investigate this, Veistinen et al. created mice that had been genetically engineered to lack the gene for the protein 23. These mice were able to survive to an age where they could be studied in animal models. They were then genetically modified to produce mice with a mutant version of 23 that did not survive until embryonic day ( E ) 18. 5. When the mutant mice survived, they were more likely to develop a severe form of Carpenter\u2019s syndrome than normal mice. Further experiments showed that the mutated mice had a higher level of FGF10 signaling, a signaling pathway that regulates the activity of other signaling pathways, and reduced the levels of an enzyme called pERK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, these mice also showed a reduction in osteoprogenitor proliferation and increased the number of stem cell divisions in their skull.

When a cell divides , it is sometimes important that genes in the daughter cells have similar levels of activity as the parent cell . This allows individual cells to \u2018remember\u2019 past events , such as exposure to cold temperatures or other environmental conditions . The pattern of methyl tags on histones can be passed onto the daughter cells , but it is not clear if this is actually responsible for providing the memory . One gene that PRC2 regulates is called FLC , which influences when a plant called Arabidopsis produces flowers . If the plants are exposed to cold temperatures , the activity of FLC is repressed . FLC activity remains low after the period of cold has ended to ensure that the plants produce flowers at an appropriate time . If this 'memory of cold' is held locally in the chromatin of the FLC gene , then it should be possible for two copies of the FLC gene in the same cell to show different gene activities . However , if the memory is stored more globally inside each cell by other proteins , then the two copies should have identical gene activities . To distinguish between these two possibilities , Berry et al . added different fluorescent tags to two copies of the FLC gene in Arabidopsis plants , which allowed the activity of each gene copy to be tracked in individual cells under a microscope . The experiments show that one copy of FLC may be switched off , while the other remains switched on inside the same cell . Furthermore , it was found that this pattern of gene activity is passed onto the daughter cells when the original cell divides . Berry et al .

In the experiments, the plants were exposed to prolonged cold exposure to a high concentration of a chemical called diffusible factors ( cis ), which is required for trans memory to be maintained. Further experiments revealed that the same gene in both trans and cis memory can also be copied to produce a different version of another protein, called a fluorescent protein. These experiments show that a specific type of trans protein ( known as a diffuseible factor ) can repress the activity of one of these trans-factors. Furthermore, when a trans factor is present in one trans gene, this repression is maintained for a longer period of time than when the trans marker is inactive. Future studies are needed to test whether the Trans memory system is also able to store the memory of genes that are copied from one gene to the next."

On the other hand , if too many chaperones are present they may slow down the protein folding process . If a cell experiences stressful conditions , or if there is a sudden demand for more proteins to be made , protein folding can be disrupted . This leads to an increase in the number of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and so the cell increases the levels of chaperone proteins to cope with this . Hsp70 chaperones are one family of chaperone proteins . These proteins can be present in a cell as single molecules ( monomers ) or as a group of several chaperone molecules ( oligomers ) . Previous research has suggested that the chaperone proteins in oligomers are inactive , but the oligomers may be rapidly broken down into monomers when the cell needs to fold more proteins . A region within the Hsp70 called the \u2018interdomain linker\u2019 is important for regulating the chaperone activity , but it is not clear if this is connected to the formation of oligomers . Preissler et al . used biochemical techniques to study how an Hsp70 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum called BiP forms oligomers . The experiments show that oligomers form when the interdomain linker of one BiP molecule is bound to the region of an adjacent BiP molecule that is normally reserved for binding to unfolded proteins . The presence of the interdomain linker makes it more difficult for unfolded proteins to bind . Further experiments challenged cells with chemicals that caused the number of unfolded proteins in the cells to increase . Under these conditions , there was a decrease in the number of BiP molecules associated with oligomers . Preissler et al . propose that BiP oligomers act as reservoirs to store BiP molecules when they aren't needed by the cell . However , when the levels of unfolded proteins rise , cells can rapidly break up these oligomers to make active monomers that help to deal with the excess numbers of unfolded proteins .

BiP is made up of two groups of molecules: active and inactive, and an inactive form. When the enzyme is exposed to a chemical called hexokinase or glucose, this causes the oligomer to bind to the substrate of another protein. This prevents the enzymes that make proteins from binding to their substrates, but it is not clear how this happens. Now, Qi et al. have used a technique called X-ray electrophoresis to study the structure of oligomolecule molecules that form the hemispheres of mammalian and bacterial cells.

Agirrezabala et al . used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy ( or cryoEM for short ) to generate a highly detailed three-dimensional model of a flexible filamentous virus called Pepino Mosaic Virus . Agirezabala et al . \u2019s findings reveal how the virus particles assemble , and the interactions between the coat protein and the ssRNA . Unexpectedly , the structure of the coat protein from Pepino Mosiac Virus is very similar to the structure of \u201cnucleoproteins\u201d from a group of viruses called the Phleboviruses , which infect animals . This similarity is striking and suggests that the gene that encodes these proteins has been transferred between the two groups of viruses during evolution . A future challenge is to find out whether this similarity extends to other groups of viruses .",
        "first_gen": "Flexible filamentous viruses are ubiquitous plant pathogens that have an enormous impact in agriculture. These viruses contain several hundred copies of a coat protein ( CP ) that protects a protein called a ssRNA. The CP is arranged in a helical fashion, which allows the virus to bind to the RNA and protect it. Flexible filaments can be found in many different species of plants, but it is not clear how they work together. To find out, Revers et al. used a technique called electron cryomicroscopy ( cryoEM ) to study the structure of Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ), a potexvirus from the family Alphaflexiviridae. This revealed that the CP protects the protein, and that it also protects other proteins, such as ribonucleoproteins, that are needed for cell-to-cell movement. In the future, it will be important to understand how these proteins interact with each other to develop new strategies to control the spread of these viruses."

These proteins stick to harmful substances , such as bacteria and other disease-causing pathogens , marking them for destruction or blocking their attack . Antibodies are highly selective , and this ability has been used to target particular molecules in research , diagnostics and therapies . Typically , antibodies need to stick to a particular segment , or \u2018epitope\u2019 , on the surface of a cell in order to trigger an immune response . Knowing where these regions are can help explain how these immune proteins work and aid the development of more effective drugs and diagnostic tools . One way to identify these sites is to measure the nano-distance between antibodies and other features on the cell surface . To do this , researchers take multiple images of the cell the antibody is attached to using light microscopy . Various statistical methods are then applied to create an \u2018average image\u2019 that has a higher resolution and can therefore be used to measure the distance between these two points more accurately . While this approach works on fixed shapes , like a perfect circle , it cannot handle human cells and bacteria which are less uniform and have more complex surfaces . Here , Kumra Ahnlide et al . have developed a new method called SiteLoc which can overcome this barrier . The method involves two fluorescent probes: one attached to a specific site on the cell\u2019s surface , and the other to the antibody or another molecule of interest . These two probes emit different colours when imaged with a fluorescent microscope . To cope with objects that have uneven surfaces , such as cells and bacteria , the two signals are transformed to \u2018follow\u2019 the same geometrical shape . The relative distance between them is then measured using statistical methods . Using this approach , Kumra Ahnlide et al . were able to identify epitopes on a bacterium , and measure distances on the surface of human red blood cells . The SiteLoc system could make it easier to develop antibody-based treatments and diagnostic tools . Furthermore , it could also be beneficial to the wider research community who could use it to probe other questions that require measuring nanoscale distances .",
        "first_gen": "Antibody binds to proteins on the surface of cells. This binding is essential for the immune system to respond to infection. Antibodies can also bind to other proteins, which can help to protect the body against infections. However, it is not clear where the binding sites are on a cell\u2019s surface. It is possible that the location of a binding site can be determined by using a technique called nanometer-scale localization, but this technique is costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis. To overcome this problem, Hauri et al. have developed a new method for detecting the locations of antibody sites on cell surface proteins. The method is based on measuring the average distance between the antibody and a reference surface protein. In the experiments, the method was used to determine the position of an antibody that is bound to a protein on its surface and to identify where it binds. Using a combination of microscopy and computer-based imaging techniques, these methods were able to accurately estimate the positions of the antibodies on their surfaces. These results show that this method can accurately identify the sites of antibodies that are binding to pathogen proteins in a wide range of cellular processes, including immune signalling, cell migration and phagocytosis. Further work is now needed to test the technique in humans and other animals."

The causes of most cases of high blood pressure are unknown , but it is often accompanied by the reduced flow of blood through small vessels in the skin and other parts of the body that are a long way from the heart . It is not clear why this change happens or why it tends to get worse over time in people with high blood pressure that has not been treated . Previous research has shown that when a tissue is starved of oxygen , blood flow to that tissue will increase . The HIF family of proteins help to increase blood flow to tissues in these low-oxygen situations . To investigate what role the skin plays in the flow of blood through small vessels , Cowburn et al . exposed mutant mice that cannot produce certain HIF proteins specifically in the skin to low-oxygen conditions . The experiments show that mice lacking either HIF-1\u03b1 or HIF-2\u03b1 in the skin have altered responses to oxygen starvation that affected their heart rate , blood pressure , skin temperature and general levels of activity . Mice lacking specific proteins controlled by the HIFs also responded in a similar way . Cowburn et al . also demonstrated that the way normal healthy mice respond to oxygen starvation is more complex than previously thought . Blood pressure and heart rate rise in during the first ten minutes . This is followed by a period of up to 36 hours where blood pressure and heart rate decrease below normal levels . By around 48 hours after exposure to low levels of oxygen , blood pressure and heart rate recover , returning to normal levels . Loss of the HIF proteins or other proteins involved in the response to oxygen starvation specifically in the skin affect when this process starts and how long it takes . These findings suggest that the responses of the skin to environmental challenges may have substantial effects on the how the heart pumps blood around the body . More studies are needed to understand how the HIFs and other proteins may contribute to high blood pressure and diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels .",

In mammals, for example, the basal layer of the epidermis is highly permeable to oxygen, which helps to increase blood flow and blood pressure. However, it is not clear how this is regulated in mammals. To investigate this question, Cowburn et al. used mice, rats, rabbits, chickens, sheep and humans to study the effects of hypoxia in mice. The experiments show that the amount of oxygen in the blood is controlled by a number of factors. One of these factors is a transcription factor called HIF. These transcription factors are involved in a range of biological processes, but it was not known how they affect the body's ability to regulate blood oxygen levels. This is because it has not been studied in humans or in animals that live in low oxygen environments. Now, he and his colleagues have used mouse skin as a model to investigate how the immune system responds to a hypoxic response. They found that when mice were exposed to high levels of high oxygen they were more likely to experience a tachycardia and heart rate that lasted as long as 24 hr. Further experiments showed that this response was also influenced by other factors, such as how much oxygen was released into the animal's blood and how quickly it recovered. Furthermore, when the animals were removed from the oxygen-deprived environment, they had a greater drop in blood pressures, heart rates and body temperature than those of normal animals. Overall, these findings demonstrate that a central role for the human body\u2019s immune response is important for controlling the response of its own tissues."

Mapping out the neurons in the brain can reveal how different circuits contribute to an animal\u2019s behavior . Yet , because the brains of mammals contain millions of neurons , these circuits are often difficult to untangle . One way to tease apart circuits of neurons uses a technique called optogenetics , which involves manipulating the genes inside neurons such that the cells produce a light-sensitive protein and respond to blasts of light . The aim is to activate a specific neuron and then see which other neurons are activated shortly afterwards , revealing a connected circuit . However , exposure to light can be imprecise . Also , the neurons in the brain are so densely packed that the nerve endings from neighboring neurons often overlap without actually being connected . This makes it unclear if activated neurons are truly part of the same circuit or simply bystanders reacting to the same nearby blast of light . To overcome this limitation , Baker et al . developed a new optogenetic approach with two important features . First , the approach makes use of a light-sensitive protein called channelrhodopsin that had been modified to confine it to the cell body of each neuron and exclude it from the nerve endings . Second , pulses of laser light were specifically shaped to target only the cell body of an individual neuron . Baker et al . show that this new method can activate neurons inside slices of mouse brain without affecting the neighboring neurons . This allowed circuits of neurons to be mapped in fine detail . This new optogenetic method is expected to shed light on the patterns of nerve signals that contribute to animal behavior . The approach may also be modified to use other light-sensitive proteins or investigate how neural circuits are altered in animal models of human disorders like autism and schizophrenia .",

These connections are made up of two distinct types of neurons, each of which has a specific role in the activity of the brain. One type of neuron is called channelrhodopsin, and it is found in many nerve cells, including the soma and axons. However, it has been difficult to precisely measure the connections between individual neurons. To do so, optogenetics is a technique that uses two-photon excitation of caged neurotransmitters, which can be used to track the movement of a neuron\u2019s electrical activity. This technique is particularly useful for studying how neurons are organized into circuits. It is also possible to study how a single neuron works by focusing on specific regions of its brain, such as the axon and somatic regions. Now, Rickgauer et al. have developed a new technique for imaging single neurons in mouse brain slices. The technique uses a special technique called scanless temporal focusing ( TF ) to selectively target a particular region of an individual neuron. Using this technique, the neurons were able to detect the presence or absence of channels in their cells. In the future, this approach could also be applied to other neurons that are involved in sensory input and production of behavioral responses."

Most cells in the body carry the same DNA , which is arranged into sections known as genes . The marked differences between cell types arise because different sets of genes are switched on or \u2018expressed\u2019 . Proteins called transcription factors control which genes are expressed by binding to DNA and recruiting groups of accessory proteins . However , it is not clear how they interact with each other and with the accessory proteins to decide whether to express a gene . For instance , it is thought that some accessory proteins may provide energy for this process , but it is unknown whether the energy is used continuously or only for a short time . Insights from physics suggest that the former could have more powerful effects . In 2014 , a team of researchers reported using a microscopy approach , known as single-molecule imaging , to follow two transcription factors called Sox2 and Oct4 in cells from mice . After analyzing the data , the researchers concluded that Sox2 and Oct4 had a specific order of binding to DNA , with Sox2 often binding first and then assisting Oct4 to bind . Now Biddle et al . report that the claim made in the 2014 study is unsupported because of errors in the way the data were analyzed . In particular , Biddle et al . argue that what the earlier study actually calculated is not an order of binding but a measure of whether energy is being continuously used when Sox2 and Oct4 bind to DNA . Biddle et al . reanalyzed the data from the 2014 work and concluded that Sox2 increases the extent of Oct4 binding to DNA , while Oct4 decreases the amount of Sox2 binding to DNA . Mathematical models suggest this may be due to the continuous use of energy as the two proteins bind to DNA . Alternatively , it could also happen if Sox2 and Oct4 helped each other to bind at some sites on DNA and hindered each other from binding in other places , even if energy is only used for a short time . These findings reveal that there is unexpected complexity in how transcription factors bind to DNA . The next step following on from this work is to carry out experiments that test the two possible explanations for how Sox2 and Oct4 interact on DNA . Including physics in the analysis may help describe more accurately the biology of how transcription factors determine gene expression . Understanding this process will shed new light on many important biological questions and may aid the development of gene therapy and other new medical techniques .",

Chen et al. have now used a technique called single-molecule microscopy to measure the activity of two proteins called Sox2 and Oct4 on the genome of living cells. The experiments show that the proteins bind to specific sites on DNA in a process called \u2018transduction\u2019. This process involves a group of proteins that are involved in the transcription of genes. These proteins are known to act in opposite ways to other proteins, but it was not known how they do this. To investigate this question, Chen and colleagues used two different methods to study the interactions between the different proteins. First, they measured how much energy was being spent on each protein, and then compared this to the amount of energy being consumed by the protein. Then, using a variety of techniques, the experiments showed that both proteins were able to bind at the same time to different DNA sites. In other words, when a protein binds to a specific DNA site, its DNA is bound to that site. When this happens, a region of DNA called the cell nucleus ( or TF ) switches between two distinct states of binding: one in which it binds first to DNA and the other to RNA. Both of these states are likely to be conserved by a mixture of positive and negative energy expenditure. As a result, these findings provide new insights into how genes are regulated. Future work will be needed to understand how this process works and to develop new methods for studying it."

However , mounting an immune response to a bacterial infection requires a lot of energy . It also can be potentially dangerous if the immune system becomes too active . Therefore , avoiding bacteria and not getting infected to begin with may be a better strategy to stay healthy . Fruit flies , like humans , can detect dangerous substances in the environment via their sense of smell , but it is not known whether they also detect disease-causing organisms through their sense of taste . Bacterial molecules called lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) can alert the immune system to the presence of dangerous bacteria .

However it was not clear how the flies actually detected the LPS .

A series of experiments showed that when a fly tastes LPS it stimulates bitter-sensing neurons in the fly\u2019s mouth and throat . The experiments also revealed that the protein that activates these neurons in response to LPS is the same protein that acts in humans as detector of pungent chemicals contained in ordinary food items like mustard , garlic and wasabi . This suggests this protein , called TRPA1 , is part of a key survival mechanism that has been preserved in many species throughout evolution . Soldano et al . showed that a fly\u2019s senses and nervous system are actively involved in protecting it from bacterial infection .

In the experiments, the flies were able to avoid eating food that contained the bacteria, but they also avoided eating foods that were not contaminated.

There are several types of T cells that play different roles in the immune response: some activate other immune cells , while others destroy cells that have been infected by viruses or other pathogens . T cells develop in a specialized organ called the thymus , where they go through a rigorous selection process before being released as mature T cells into the rest of the body . This selection process includes eliminating individual T cells that are found to be sub-standard , perhaps because they might mistake our own cells for enemy cells . However , many of the details of the later stages of T cell development are not fully understood . Han et al . have now found that a protein called Zfp335 that is involved in the production of mature T cells . Mice carrying a mutation in the gene that makes this protein have fewer mature T cells than normal mice .

One way to understand this process is to look for mutations in a protein called Zfp335, a zinc finger protein that is found in mouse embryos. This protein is essential for the development of T lymphocytes, but it was not known how it regulates the production of the protein. Now, Klein et al. have identified a mutant mouse mutant that harbors a mutation in this protein, known as bloto. Bloto is a mouse model of a type of immune cell that has been shown to have a developmental defect that prevents it from becoming mature. The mutant mice also lack a gene for a transcription factor called Ankle2. Further experiments revealed that this gene is mutated in mice that have been genetically engineered to produce a different form of ZFP335 than normal mice. Furthermore, this mutant mutant had a lower number of zfp334 target genes, suggesting that the mutation may be a result of altered selection and maturation.

These RNA messages are then interpreted by the ribosome , the molecular machine that makes proteins . Many messages are produced from each gene , and each message can be read multiple times . Thus , it should follow that the number of messages produced dictates the number of proteins made . However , this is not the case and the number of proteins produced cannot be completely predicted from knowing the number of messenger RNAs . Cells control how much of a given protein they produce through interactions between the messenger RNAs and other regulatory RNAs . The regulatory RNAs bind directly to a message and impede protein production . Because there are millions of RNAs in a cell , these interactions have evolved to be highly specific . Nevertheless , it seems inevitable that messenger RNAs would encounter other RNAs too , which could short-circuit gene regulation and lead to less protein being produced . Umu et al . have now asked if such short-circuit events are selected against during evolution . Computational tools were used to predict the strength of binding between the RNAs found in the dominant forms of microbial life on Earth: the bacteria and the archaea . This approach revealed that the majority of messenger RNAs bind more weakly to the most common RNA molecules found in cells than would be expected by chance . Weakened binding should prevent the RNA molecules from becoming tangled with each other and ensure that protein levels are not perturbed by unintended interactions between highly expressed messages and other RNAs . To test this hypothesis further , Umu et al . generated versions of the gene for a green fluorescent protein that differed only in how well their messenger RNAs could avoid interacting with the most abundant RNAs in E . coli cells . Those messengers that were designed to avoid interacting with other RNAs yielded far more protein than those that were not . The findings show that taking this kind of avoidance into account can improve predictions about how much protein will be produced and should therefore make it easier to control protein production in experimental systems . Finally , the messenger RNAs of some bacteria do not show such clear avoidance . However , these bacteria have a more complex internal cell structure . This finding hints at an alternative means for avoiding short-circuiting events that could be used by more complicated cells , such of those of animals and plants , which also contain much larger numbers of RNAs .",

This suggests that there is a strong selection for the least abundant mRNA:ncRNA interactions, and that it can be both predicted and controlled.

More and more muscles become affected over time until eventually the muscles that control breathing also become paralyzed . Most patients die within two to five years of diagnosis . Motoneurons consist of a cell body plus a cable-like structure called the axon . The cell body of each motoneuron sits within the spinal cord , and the axon extends out of the spinal cord to the motoneuron\u2019s target muscle . Within the muscle the axon divides into branches , each of which connects with multiple muscle fibers . The breakdown of these connections , known as neuromuscular junctions , is one of the first signs of ALS . Does a motoneuron lose all of its connections with muscle fibers at once , or do the connections break down a few at a time ? This distinction is important as it will help to identify the events that lead to muscle paralysis in ALS . To find out , Martineau et al . studied mice that had two genetic mutations: one that causes ALS and another that produces fluorescent molecules in some motoneurons .

Moreover , motoneurons grow new branches and form new connections even while losing their old ones .

However, it is not clear whether this process is the first manifestation of a disease-modifying mechanism. To address this question, Li et al. studied the activity of single motor-units in mice that had been genetically engineered to have ALS. This revealed that after a few weeks, the neurons that make up the neuron die and the nerve fibers that they innervate are replaced. In the next three months, these neurons will be replaced by new neurons, which will eventually replace the old ones. Further experiments showed that the same neurons die asynchronously in ALS mice, and that this happens in a similar way to a nerve injury in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Furthermore, when the mice were exposed to drugs that could treat the disease, they were more likely to die of ALS than in normal mice. Overall, this suggests that ALS is an early disease that can be treated by treating it with a drug."

Now, Zhao et al. have used a technique called stable isotope labeling in tissue culture to reveal that a protein called ISG15 is present in nonphagocytic cells.

These events can be triggered by the presence of other proteins, such as cytokines known to counteract infection, or by genes that are activated during the infection of the host cell. Further experiments showed that when a cell is infected with Listeriosis, an enzyme called STING ( which senses bacterial DNA and signals ) triggers the activation of a pathway that regulates the activity of cytokine signaling. Importantly, when the cells were exposed to the virus, this protein was switched off, and it was not known whether it had any effect on the response of normal cells or whether this was due to a process known as the \u201ccytoplasmic surveillance\u201d pathway ( or CSP ). Zhao and colleagues then used this technique to identify the proteins that could be responsible for the protective effect of infection and to investigate whether the same mechanism is also found in other types of immune responses."

Identifying these movements is an important part of understanding how proteins work and interact with each other . Unfortunately , when researchers study the structures of proteins , they often look at the \u2018average\u2019 shape a protein takes , missing out on other conformations the protein might only be in temporarily . An important technique for studying protein flexibility is known as single molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . In this technique , two light-sensitive tags are attached to the same protein molecule and give off a signal when they come into close contact . This nano-scale sensor allows structural biologists to get information from individual protein movements that can be lost when looking at the average conformations of proteins . Advances in the instruments used to perform FRET have made observing the motion of individual proteins more widely accessible to non-specialists , but the analysis of the data that these instruments produce still requires a high level of expertise . To lower the barrier for non-specialists to use the technology , and to ensure that experiments can be reproduced on different instruments and by different researchers , Thomsen et al . have developed a new way to automate the data analysis . They used machine learning technology to recognize , filter and characterize data so as to produce reliable results , with the user only needing to perform a couple of steps . This new analysis approach could help expand the use of single-molecule FRET to different fields , allowing researchers to investigate the importance of protein flexibility for certain diseases , or to better understand the roles that proteins have in a cell .",

One way to study these molecules is to use a technique called single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer ( smFRET ). This technique is a powerful tool for studying the structure and interactions between different molecules. However, it is not a direct imaging modality or data treatment for biomolecular dynamics. Instead, the technique can be used to analyze large amounts of data from raw images. The technique relies on a combination of algorithms and machine learning to make predictions based on the data. In the past few years, researchers have developed a new method that can analyze a large amount of raw data, but it was not possible to do this in real time. Now, Hohlbein et al. have created a free-to-use, open-source software that combines the best of both existing and new techniques to produce a fully automated analysis software. It is the first time that a computer has been trained to perform this type of analysis, and it has the potential to be widely used in the field of structural biology. Moreover, this software is free to download and use and is available for anyone with limited programming skills to easily use."

Much of the DNA in a cell is wrapped around proteins called histones to form a compact structure called chromatin . The DNA in chromatin is often so tightly packed that the genes in the DNA cannot to be accessed or switched on . A complex of proteins called the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 ( or PRC1 for short ) pack DNA into chromatin to switch genes off ( and keep them off ) in both plants and animals . Other proteins are known to weakly bind to this complex , including one called SCM in fruit flies . However , this protein has not been extensively studied . Bonasio , Lecona et al . have now looked at a related version of this protein that binds to chromatin in humans . These experiments revealed that this protein , which is called SCML2A , also binds to molecules of RNA , and Bonasio , Lecona et al . also identified a previously unrecognized domain within SCML2A that interacts with these molecules . Like other domains in this protein that bind to PRC1 and histones , SCML2A needs its RNA-binding region to be able to bind to chromatin in order to target and switch off certain genes . As such , the findings of Bonasio , Lecona et al . support models whereby RNA molecules can regulate the expression of genes , and suggest that some RNA molecules do this by interacting with SCML2A . Future work is needed to address whether RNA molecules serve as guides that direct SCML2A to specific genes that need to be switched off , or whether these molecules' roles are more complex .",

These proteins are made up of a protein called SCML2, which is found on the surface of DNA in mammals and plants. However, it is not clear how this protein is involved in gene regulation. To investigate this question, Lecona et al. used a technique called RNA immunoprecipitation ( RIP ) to look for proteins that are not stable components of known polycomb complexes. The experiments revealed that a group of proteins known as SCM binds to a region called the RNA-binding region ( or RBR ) that is responsible for binding to the DNA. This region is also known to bind to other proteins, such as RNA helicase MOV10, and is thought to regulate the activity of certain proteins in the cell. In mammals, this region has been shown to be important for controlling the expression of genes, but little is known about how it works in humans and other mammals. Now, Kaneko, Yap, Wang, Rinn and Kassis have used RIP to identify a new protein that plays a key role in this process. SCMP is a homolog of Drosophila scM, a species of fruit fly that has a large number of copies of its genetic material, including DNA, RNA and proteins. It was also found that the protein also interacts with another protein, called a \u2018RNA binding region\u2019, that helps to control the production of specific DNA sequences. Further work is now needed to understand how the proteins interact with each other in different contexts."

        "ground_truth": "Many genes code for proteins that carry out essential tasks . The instructions in a gene are first copied into a messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , and a molecular machine known as a ribosome reads the copied instructions in groups of three letters at a time ( called codons ) . The ribosome translates the order of the codons into a sequence of amino acids; each amino acid is carried into the ribosome by a transfer RNA ( tRNA ) molecule . As it translates , the ribosome joins each new amino acid to the one before it , like the links in a chain . Finally , the newly built protein chain passes through a tunnel to exit the ribosome . Ribosomes do not build all proteins at a constant rate; there are many examples of proteins that stall when they are in the ribosome exit tunnel . It is thought that this stalling is an important way for cells to control the expression of proteins . SecM is a bacterial protein that stalls while it is being made . Previous research has shown that a sequence of amino acids in SecM ( called the arrest sequence ) interacts with components of the ribosome tunnel . This interaction leads to stalling , and regulates the translation of another important bacterial protein ( called SecA ) that is encoded downstream on the same mRNA as SecM . If SecM-induced stalling takes place , the translation of SecA actually increases . Nevertheless , it remains poorly understood how SecM stalls in the ribosome . Zhang et al . have now solved the structures of SecM proteins stalled inside ribosomes using a method called cryo-electron microscopy . This approach identified two different states of SecM present in the ribosome , which corresponded to two different stalling mechanisms . The addition of an amino acid to a growing protein occurs in stages . First , the tRNA that carries the amino acid to the ribosome and bind to it in a region known as the A-site . After this , the tRNA moves to the P-site where the attached amino acid is incorporated into the elongating protein chain . Zhang et al . observed that the arrest sequence of SecM and the ribosome tunnel interact extensively . These interactions are strong and alter the configuration of both the A-site and P-site of the ribosome . This has two major consequences for translation . First , the tRNA cannot be stably accommodated in the A-site and secondly , its passage to the P-site is slowed down . Both these mechanisms contribute to stalling . This study provides a detailed analysis of how the ribosome can adjust to control translation . It also highlights that codon-specific control of translation constitutes an important component of how gene expression is regulated .",
        "first_gen": "Ribosomes are a part of the cell\u2019s genetic code, and are responsible for controlling the expression of many genes. The ribosome is made up of a protein called SecM, which is a secreted protein with 170 amino acids in length. When a gene is translated into a new protein, it must be translated to produce the new gene. This process takes place at different stages in the translation process. For example, when the mRNA is transcribed into the protein SecA, the RNA molecule that secA is sent to the correct mRNA molecule. However, this process does not always take place in a single place. Instead, a process called stalling can occur at distinct stages. In the case of Escherichia coli, for instance, an exit tunnel is used to stop the transcription of genes from being translated, but it is not clear how this happens. Now, Voorhees et al. have used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to analyze the structure of two distinct forms of stalled mRNA. These two forms are thought to be linked together by a series of interactions between the end and end of secM and a peptidyl-transferase center, both of which are important for the production of proteins. Together, these findings reveal a complex of molecular mechanisms that can be controlled by two different mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is the presence of an end-to-end region called the \u201cexit tunnel\u201d, where the peptide-bond forms a bond with the newly translated protein. Further experiments showed that this region is also active in two other forms, one in post-state and the other in hybrid rotated state. Moreover, in both cases the exit and exit regions are active at the same time, allowing the release of new mRNA molecules from the region that is active during translation. Furthermore, as a result of this work, researchers are now able to understand how these two mechanisms work together to control gene expression."

The retina is the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye , and it contains the fovea , the region that provides the clearest vision . Light must be focused on the retina to create images , a feat achieved by the transparent parts at the front of the eye called the cornea and lens . These parts of the eye are called the optics . Between birth and adulthood , significant changes take place in the eye . Most noticeably , the distance between the optics and the fovea grows by about seven millimeters . Cells called cone photoreceptors , which provide light sensitivity , migrate and pack into the fovea . Finally , the eye\u2019s optics adjust to maintain a sharp focus . At the same time , the brain is learning how to process inputs from the eyes to generate mental images that realistically correspond to the physical world around it . The development of the eye is fascinating in its complexity , but for more and more people , the process does not go as expected . Specifically , a growing proportion of the population has eyes that are too long . This means that , for light reflected by far away objects , the eye\u2019s optics form an image in front of the retina instead of on it . As a result , images of distant objects cannot be seen clearly , a condition known as myopia or nearsightedness . Researchers have also discovered that nearsighted people see less clearly than those who do not use glasses , even when given a sharp image to examine at close range . It has been hypothesized that these deficits result from stretching of the retina as the eye becomes bigger . Until recently , testing this hypothesis by looking at cone photoreceptors directly in the eye was impossible . This is because the optics of all eyes have small imperfections that distort the light passing through them , including any light used to take high resolution microscopic images of the fovea . This hurdle can be overcome using adaptive optics , which means adding a deformable mirror to the instrument being used to image the eye that can adjust to correct the distortion . Wang et al . use a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to check the density of cones at the fovea in relation to the size of the eye . They show that although the center of the fovea has fewer cones when the eye is bigger , this effect is more than offset because the longer eye increases magnification . So , if a near-sighted person wearing contacts and someone who does not need glasses stood side-by-side admiring the full moon , the near-sighted person would most likely have more cones sampling the image and should therefore have a higher resolution view . These findings rule out reductions in the density of cone photoreceptors as the cause or effect of visual deficits associated with near-sightedness , adding to the understanding of this common condition .",

This is known as the foveal center, and it is thought that this stretch is caused by retinal stretching. However, it was not clear how this stretching affects cone density in living eyes. To investigate this, Agaoglu et al. used a new generation adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the focal point of each eye of 16 subjects. The images were then compared to the images taken in the previous studies. These results show that myopes generally have the smallest number of cones within a fixed area, in square mm. In contrast, shorter eyes have larger cones in their front and back. Further experiments showed that these smaller cones are more spaced out in longer eyes than in shorter ones. Overall, these results suggest that a longer eye is more likely to be able to sample the field of vision than a shorter one. Future studies will investigate whether this is the cause of myopia."

For example , the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis , but generally , it lives harmlessly in the nose , and is particularly common in children and the elderly . The longer the bacteria live in the nose before being killed by the immune system , the more likely they are to be transmitted to another person .

In their model , Lees et al . calculated that the bacteria\u2019s genetics explained over 60% of the variability in survival time .

This ion flow generates the electrical signals that stimulate the heart muscle to contract for each heart beat . Different ion channels influence different steps in the initiation and termination of each electrical signal . For example , the IKs ion channel complex helps to return the cell to a resting state so the heart muscle can relax . This allows chambers of the heart to fill with blood before the next beat pumps blood throughout the body . Mutations that affect IKs cause serious heart conditions that affect heart rhythm , such as Long QT Syndrome . The IKs complex consists of channels that are each made of four copies of a protein called KCNQ1 , through which potassium ions exit the cell . This channel opens in response to changes in the voltage across the cell membrane ( known as the \u201cmembrane potential\u201d ) . A small protein subunit called KCNE1 also makes up part of the complex , but it was not clear how many KCNE1 molecules combine with KCNQ1 to form a working channel complex . Several previous studies have reported two different results: that the KCNQ1 channel complex only exists with two KCNE1 molecules , or that the association is flexible , allowing the complex to contain up to four KCNE1 subunits . Murray et al . have now constructed IKs fusion channels out of different numbers of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 molecules to investigate how different KCNQ1:KCNE1 ratios affect how the channel works . Measuring the responses of these modified channels in mammalian cells revealed that channels with four KCNE1 subunits conducted ions better than channels with one or two KCNE1s . The channels containing fewer KCNE1s also opened at lower membrane potentials and after a shorter delay following a change in the membrane potential . Further experiments also supported the theory that up to four independent KCNE1 subunits may be easily added to the IKs ion channel complex . Murray et al . suggest that by being able to form channel complexes containing different numbers of KCNE1 subunits , cells can more flexibly control the rate at which ions flow out of the heart cells to tune the electrical signals that trigger each heart beat . The next challenges will be to determine the composition of the IKs channel complex in adult heart cells and to investigate how the complex might change with disease .",

KCNE1 acts as a voltage-gated ion channel in the heart, and is responsible for controlling the speed of the current at high heart rates. However, it is not clear how this process works. To investigate this question, Werry et al. used a technique called total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to count the number of \u03b2-subunits in a single cell. The experiments revealed that two of these \u03b2 subunits are present on the cell surface, while a third subunit is present at the outside of each channel. In addition, the experiments also showed that the \u03b1 and \u03b2 of a protein called Kv7. 1 are linked to one or four other \u03b2 proteins, but it was not known how they interact with each other. This suggests that there is no intrinsic mechanism that limits the association between the \u03b2 and \u03b1 proteins. Instead, this is the result of an interaction between two different types of beta proteins: one called EQQQ and four ( which are also known as EQ1 ). When combined with another \u03b2 protein, KCNNQ has a flexible structure that allows it to be connected to the alpha protein and the beta protein to bind to it. These findings suggest that a cooperative mechanism prevents the interaction of two or more \u03b1, two, three, four, five, six or even four alpha, beta, \u03b2, alpha and 4 alpha proteins from the same protein. Further work is now needed to find out if this mechanism is also present in other tissues, such as the myocardium and ear."

This is because the cells that are primed to regenerate die instead , but it was not clear why this happens . Many immune cells have roles in fighting infection and in responding to tissue damage .

Hasegawa et al . \u2013 who include several researchers involved in the 2015 study \u2013 used genetic approaches to investigate the role of inflammation in tissue regeneration in zebrafish . The experiments show that several genes involved in inflammation \u2013 including one called interleukin 1b \u2013 were active over longer periods of time in the mutant fish compared with normal zebrafish . The gene produces a signal protein and this prolonged activity causes the primed regenerative cells to die . However , the cells can survive if interleukin 1b activity is quickly suppressed by macrophages . The experiments also show that , in order for tissues to regenerate properly , interleukin 1b needs to be active for only a short period of time . The findings reveal that some inflammation is needed for tissues to regenerate , but that a more severe inflammatory response can block the process .

Hosegaw et. also found that a type of immune cell called the epidermal cells\u2014which are thought to be immune to inflammation\u2014produces an inflammatory response called apoptosis. In addition to this, the eukaryotic cells produce a signaling pathway that regulates the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Further experiments showed that this pathway is regulated by the immune cells surrounding the damaged tissue and by macrophages in response to tissue injury. By studying the effects of this signalling pathway on the cell's response during tissue damage, this work provides a new way to understand the mechanisms that underlie tissue loss.

This moving about mixes the cell\u2019s contents , which is crucial for its survival and reproduction . Proteins can group together , or with other molecules , to form bigger units . This grouping together depends on the properties of protein surfaces; for example , opposite electrical charges on the surfaces of proteins can cause them to group together . Grouping together proteins causes them to move around cells more slowly . Indeed the ribosome , a protein unit that constructs new proteins and is found in every known species , moves over a hundred times more slowly than the average protein . Finding out how the total electric charge inside the cells of different species affects the mobility of proteins would give us a better idea of how fast tasks can be carried out in cells . Schavemaker , \u015amigiel et al . now show that protein surface charge matters a great deal in the gut microbe Escherichia coli . In these cells , negatively charged and neutral proteins move about rapidly whereas positively charged proteins move up to 100 times more slowly . In the salt-loving microbe Haloferax volcanii the positive proteins move relatively fast , but still more slowly than negatively charged and neutral proteins . In all likelihood this is because the protein charges are shielded from each other by large amounts of small charged molecules ( which come from salts ) in the Hfx . volcanii cells .

For example, when a protein binds to a ribonucleic acid, it can diffuse up to 100-fold faster than if the protein is bound to the ribosome. This is because the molecular motion in the cytoplasm is diffusive, and so it is important to determine the diffusion coefficients of the proteins. The diffusion coefficient is a measure of how quickly a cell can move in response to changes in its environment. In the bacteria Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Haloferax volcanii, a type of bacterium known as E. coli that produces many types of proteins, these proteins are much more sticky than non-protein molecules. However, this is not the case in all bacteria. To investigate this question, van den Berg et al. used a technique called surface-modified fluorescent proteins ( or FPs for short ) to study how proteins diffuse and how they interact with their surroundings. These experiments revealed that in E. coli the flow of protein molecules is much slower than in other bacteria, which may explain the difference in mobility between the two species. Further experiments showed that the concentration of positive and negative proteins on the surface of these two bacteria was much less than positive ones. Furthermore, positive proteins were less likely to diffuse than negative ones, suggesting that they are less sticky. Overall, the findings shed new light on how diffusion is influenced by the environment and may help us to understand how cells work."

In mammals , this is limited to wound healing , whereas other vertebrates\u2014such as salamanders and zebrafish\u2014can regenerate parts of internal organs and even entire appendages . The planarian , a flatworm , is even more remarkable , being able to regenerate its head or tail following amputation , and even a whole animal from just a small body fragment . This is particularly impressive given that planarians have a complex internal anatomy , which includes muscles , intestines , a system similar to kidneys , and a central nervous system with a brain . How is such regeneration accomplished ? Why are planarians able to regenerate their bodies so extensively , whereas humans cannot ? To what extent are the mechanisms of planarian regeneration common to other animals ? These questions have driven the study of planarian regeneration for more than a century , but it is only in recent years that the tools needed to address these questions at the molecular level have become available . Planarian regeneration proceeds over several days and involves multiple processes , including gene expression , cell division and cell death . Importantly , it has recently been shown that planarians activate different responses depending on whether an injury results in significant tissue loss\u2014and therefore requires regeneration for repair\u2014or if simple wound healing will be sufficient . The mechanisms behind these different responses to injury have , however , remained a mystery . Now , Gavi\u00f1o et al . have identified a key mechanism in the initiation of regeneration following tissue loss . This is centered on the gene follistatin , which is expressed following wounding . When genetic techniques are used to disrupt the expression of follistatin , regeneration is completely blocked . However , the animal\u2019s ability to routinely replace old cells via a stem-cell mediated mechanism is unaffected . This indicates that follistatin is specifically required for the replacement of cells lost through injury . Gavi\u00f1o et al . further demonstrate that the protein encoded by follistatin likely initiates tissue regeneration upon substantial tissue loss through inhibition of proteins called Activins . Activin and Follistatin proteins are broadly conserved in evolution , and are also expressed in mammals , raising the possibility that similar molecular circuits may govern regenerative responses in many species .",

Wenemoser, Reddien et al. have now used a technique called quantitative PCR to identify a protein that is required for the regeneration of cells in planarians. The experiments show that the proteins that are needed for regeneration are found in the cells that divide to produce new cells. These cells are called follistatin homologs, and they are produced at different levels in different parts of the body. In the absence of tissue, the cell divides to create new cell types, called mitotic cells ( or \u2018missing-tissue\u2019 cells ) that can be used to replace damaged tissue. When a wound is caused by a major injury, a cell that normally divides into two distinct types of cell becomes inactive and is replaced by another cell type called activin. Further experiments showed that a gene called Smed-follistin inhibits the activity of two other proteins needed to activate regeneration after an injury. Together, these findings suggest that this protein regulates the processes that lead to the formation of missing tissues. Future work will focus on understanding how cells respond to injuries that cause tissue to be absent."

Mutations can give rise to new traits but are mostly harmful to the cells , or cause cancer; therefore , cells have evolved tools that can efficiently spot these mistakes and repair them . One of the main tools is called mismatch repair ( MMR ) . Defects in the cell's mismatch repair tools can wreak havoc as this allows many mutations to accumulate . Zhao et al . looked at the genomes of tumors where mismatch repair was not working properly to see what makes these \u2018MMR-deficient tumors\u2019 different from other tumors . This revealed that MMR-deficient tumors have similar patterns of mutations to those seen in egg and sperm cells . This was unexpected and suggests that mutations that are not corrected by mismatch repair are an important source of the genetic differences found between different humans , and between humans and their ancestors . Identifying cancerous tumors that are MMR-deficient is vital , as these tumors tend not to respond to commonly used cancer treatments . However , current clinical methods to identify MMR-deficient tumors often fail or produce results that are difficult to interpret . MMR-deficient tumors commonly contain mutations called indels , where short fragments of DNA are inserted or deleted into longer DNA sequences . Zhao et al . have found 59 indels that can be used to detect MMR-deficient tumors , where each indel had been identified in several tumors taken from different tissues . This new approach allowed MMR-deficiency to be identified in several types of tumor , including colon and ovarian cancers , with greater sensitivity and accuracy than the existing methods . Zhao et al . also found that the indels in MMR-deficient tumors reduce the ability of the tumors to repair a type of DNA damage called double-strand breaks . In these , both strands of DNA that make up the double helix are broken and the DNA chain is severed . As this kind of damage is very harmful to a cell , making more double-strand breaks could therefore form part of a more effective treatment against MMR-deficient tumors; further research is needed to investigate this possibility .",

In some cases, these errors can lead to the formation of tumors that are resistant to treatment. However, it is not clear how this happens. Now, Palles et al. have used a technique called whole-genome sequencing to examine the genomes of endometrial ( EM ) or colorectal ( CM ) tumors. The experiments revealed that a substantial fraction of the genetic variation in these tumors arises from mutations that occur in MMR genes, but not in other genes. Moreover, a large set of genetic markers were identified that could be used to detect the presence or absence of these mutations. These markers could help to identify which mutations are responsible for the spread of diseases, such as Lynch syndrome, and which are the most common causes of cancer. Furthermore, the marker set was able to distinguish between MMR-deficient tumors and non-MMR tumors, suggesting that it may be possible to develop new treatments for these diseases."

Manipulating these interactions allows researchers to control a wide variety of cell behaviors . A system called \u2018Magnets\u2019 uses light to trigger interactions between proteins . Magnets uses a segment of a protein called Vivid from a common bread mold that responds to light . When light shines on two of these segments , it causes them to bind together , in a process known as dimerization . In the Magnets system , Vivid segments are attached to specific proteins or organelles . By using light , researchers can force their target molecules to come together and trigger signals that can change cell behavior . However , the Magnets system has limitations: its stability and low efficiency mean that the cells need to be kept at low temperatures and that several copies of Vivid are needed . These conditions can interfere with the activity of the target proteins . To expand the technique , Benedetti et al . added mutations to make the Vivid protein more similar to proteins found in fungi that thrive at temperatures around 50\u00b0C . These changes meant that the enhanced system could work at body temperature in mammals . Further mutations at the interface between the two Vivid segments improved the efficiency of dimerization . This enhanced version was put to the test in different applications , including delivering proteins to different organelles and bringing organelles together . The enhanced Magnets system should enable researchers to control a greater variety of signaling events in the cell . In addition , the methodology established for improving the efficiency of the Magnets system could be useful to researchers working on other proteins .",
        "first_gen": "Photodimerizers are small molecules that are fused together to form a molecule called a dimer. Photodimers can be used to manipulate a wide range of biological processes. For example, when light is applied to a protein, it can change the activity of the protein in the cell. However, light can also alter how the proteins interact with other proteins, which can lead to the formation of new connections between the two proteins. In the laboratory, a fluorescent protein called the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor is fused to one of two different components, called Magnets. The two components are very small, but they are able to interact in a very precise way. To test this, Benedetti et al. engineered a pair of light-inducible dimers to fuse to each other. This made it possible to study how light interacts with proteins in different parts of a cell, such as the outer mitochondrial membrane and the cytoplasm, and to reconstitute the three-dimensional structures that make up the surface of cells. These structures were then tested in cells grown in small amounts at low temperatures ( 28\u00b0C ) for 12\u201324 hr. They showed that these structures could be modified to allow them to bind to different proteins at the same time. Further experiments revealed that, in addition to binding to specific proteins with a single excitation wavelength, they could also be activated by a small molecule that is much smaller and less sensitive to light compared to other light sources. Furthermore, the experiments show that the new structures can rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, where they can then be switched on and off at different temperatures. Together, these findings provide a new way to test the effectiveness of photodemers in animals and humans."

First , the DNA is copied to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid ( or messenger RNA for short ) . Next , machines called ribosomes use the messenger RNAs as templates to assemble chains of amino acids \u2013 the building blocks of proteins \u2013 in a process called translation . Another type of RNA molecule called transfer RNA carries each amino acid to the ribosomes . If a specific transfer RNA is not available for translation at the right time , the ribosome might stall as it moves along the messenger RNA . At this point , the ribosome needs to be restarted or it will fall off the mRNA without finishing the protein . In 2014 , a group of researchers reported that certain types of brain cells are very sensitive to ribosome stalling , and tend to die if translation does not continue . A protein called GTPBP2 was shown to play an important role in restarting stalled ribosomes in these cells . Here , Ishimura , Nagy et al . \u2013 including some of the researchers from the earlier work \u2013 investigated the molecular pathways that ribosome stalling triggers in brain cells using mutant mice that lacked the GTPBP2 protein . The experiments show that ribosome stalling activates an enzyme known as GCN2 , which was already known to sense other types of malfunctions in cellular processes . Ishimura , Nagy et al . also show that GCN2 triggers stress responses in the cells by activating a communication system called the ATF4 pathway . This pathway protects the cells from damage , and its absence results in more rapid cell deterioration and death . The next challenges are to understand the exact mechanism by which GCN2 senses stalled ribosomes , and to find out how ribosome stalling causes the death of brain cells .",
        "first_gen": "Ribosome stalling is one of the most common causes of neurodegeneration in humans and other animals. Ribosomes are made up of a protein called messenger RNA ( mRNA for short ), which is then translated into proteins. However, it is not clear exactly how ribosomatization is triggered during translation. To investigate this question, Hoechst et al. studied the brain of mice that had been genetically engineered to be unable to translate mRNA into protein. The experiments revealed that the mRNA translation process is stalled at the 5\u2019 end of an mRNA molecule, and that this process triggers a process known as the integrated stress response ( ISR ). This process involves a group of proteins called the eIF2\u03b1 kinase that is responsible for the elongation of mRNA molecules. These proteins are then switched on and off in the mouse brain, but it was not known how they are activated in this way. In addition, the experiments showed that a key transcription factor called GCN2 plays an important role in regulating the activation of this signaling pathway. GTPBP2 is also involved in activating this pathway in mice with a mutation in a gene that encodes the gene for an enzyme called ATF4. Previous studies have shown that when a mutant mouse is exposed to high levels of oxidative stress, this protein is activated and the protein stops translating mRNA. Further experiments show that an increased level of phosphorylation of ATF2 increases the activity of other transcription factors that regulate the initiation of translation in these mice. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms that trigger the process of transcription."

For example , children and adolescents who are malnourished , or who suffer from serious diseases , will generally be shorter as adults . This is important because taller people generally live longer , are less likely to suffer from heart disease and stroke , and taller women and their children are less likely to have complications during and after birth . Taller people may also earn more and be more successful at school . However , they are also more likely to develop some cancers . The NCD Risk Factor Collaboration set out to find out how tall people are , on average , in every country in the world at the moment , and how this has changed over the past 100 years . The analysis revealed large differences in height between countries . The tallest men were born in the last part of the 20th century in the Netherlands , and were nearly 183 cm tall on average . The shortest women were born in 1896 in Guatemala , and were on average 140 cm tall . The difference between the shortest and tallest countries is about 20 cm for both men and women . This means there are large differences between countries in terms of nutrition and the risk of developing some diseases . The way in which height has changed over the past 100 years also varies from country to country . Iranian men born in 1996 were around 17 cm taller than those born in 1896 , and South Korean women were 20 cm taller . In other parts of the world , particularly in South Asia and parts of Africa , people are only slightly taller than 100 years ago , and in some countries people are shorter than they were 50 years ago . There is a need to better understand why height has changed in different countries by different amounts , and use this information to improve nutrition and health across the world .

For example, people born between 1896 and 1996 were the tallest people on the planet, while those born in the 1960s and 70s were among the shortest. However, it is not clear how tall people are over the past century, or how much they have changed over their lifespans. Martorell et al. used data from more than 18. 6 million people to estimate the height difference between men and women in 200 countries. The results show that women and men have been growing taller in recent decades, even though they were born around the same time as men a century ago. This suggests that the difference is due to social factors, such as age, education and social position. In addition, the differences in height in some countries have increased over time, but not in others. These findings are consistent with the findings of previous studies, which have looked at the world\u2019s population-based measurements of adult height for over 20, 000 people over 100 years. They also showed that men who grew taller over this century were more likely to live in countries where they had higher education or higher social status than their female counterparts. Overall, these findings suggest that height has changed substantially and unevenly in many countries, despite substantial changes in social and economic factors that affect health and longevity."

Opioids are widely used to treat opioid addiction, but they can also cause respiratory depression, which can lead to death. One of the most common causes of death from opioid overdoses is the loss of a receptor called Oprm1. This receptor is found in a number of brain regions, including the brainstem and the central nervous system. However, it is not clear which of these brain areas are responsible for the effects of opioids. To address this question, Pisanski and Pagliardini studied mice that had been injected with opioids, and found that only 70\u2013140 neurons in this region were involved in their breathing. These neurons are not required for opioids to cause the breathing to slow down. In addition, the neurons that produce the receptor were not found at the same time in these mice, suggesting that these neurons do not contribute to the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The next step will be to identify which brain sites are involved and how they are affected by the opioid drug."

        "ground_truth": "Liver diseases related to the human hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) kill about 1 million people every year , and more than 350 million people around the world are infected with the virus . Some 15 million of these people are also infected with the hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) , which is a satellite virus of HBV , and this places them at an even higher risk of liver diseases , including cancer . The viruses are known to enter liver cells by binding to receptors on their surface before being engulfed . Both HBV and HDV have outer coats that consist of three kinds of envelope proteins , and a region called the pre-S1 domain in one of them is known to have a central role in the interaction between the viruses and the receptors and , therefore , in infecting the cells . However , the identity of the HBV receptor has remained a mystery . Now Yan et al . have identified this receptor to be sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide . This protein , known as NTCP for short , is normally involved in the circulation of bile acids in the body . In addition to humans , only two species are known to be susceptible to infection by human HBV and HDV\u2014chimpanzees and a small mammal known as the treeshrew . Yan et al . started by isolating primary liver cells from treeshrews , and then used a combination of advanced purification and mass spectrometry analysis to show that the NTCP on the surface of the cells interacts with the pre-S1 domain in HBV . The authors then performed a series of gene knockdown experiments on liver cells of both human and treeshrew origin: when the gene that codes for NTCP was silenced , HBV infection was greatly reduced . Moreover , they were able to transfect HepG2 cells\u2014which are widely used in research into liver disease , but are not susceptible to HBV and HDV infection\u2014with NTCP from humans and treeshrews to make them susceptible . Similarly , although monkeys are not susceptible to HBV , replacing just five amino acids in monkey NTCP with their human counterparts was enough to make the monkey NTCP a functional receptor for the viruses . In the past , basic research into HBV and the development of antiviral therapeutics have both been hindered by the lack of suitable in vitro infection systems and animal models . Now , the work of Yan et al . means that it will be possible to use NTCP-complemented HepG2 cells for challenges as diverse as fundamental studies of basic viral entry/replication mechanisms and large-scale drug screening . It is also possible that HBV and HDV infection might interfere with some of the important physiological functions carried out by NTCP , so the latest work could also be of interest to medical scientists working on other diseases related to these infections .",

However, it is not clear how the virus enters the liver and how it can infect the human body.

This protein is thought to be a key determinant for the entry of the two viruses, but it has not been confirmed whether it also interacts with other proteins in the host\u2019s liver. Now, Schulze et al. have used a technique called photo-cross-linking to identify the protein that binds to both the H and HDV proteins. Using a combination of biochemical approaches and biochemical assays, the experiments revealed that this protein interacts specifically with a molecule called sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide ( NTCP ), a transporter predominantly expressed in human hepatocytes. In addition, removing the amino acids 157\u2013165 of this transporter from the mouse liver showed that it was a functional receptor for both virus and HV infection. Further experiments confirmed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1, also known as the \u2018nucleotide binding partner\u2032, is involved in binding to a specific protein on the cell surface. These results show that NTRP binds specifically to one of these proteins, and that blocking the expression of a gene that encodes the gene for this receptor is important for HIV and hepatitis B infections in humans and chimpanzees."

Memory CD8 T cells , a type of immune cell that is compromised by sepsis , are a long-lived population of cells that \u2018remember\u2019 previous infection or vaccination , and then react faster to prevent the same illness if the person ever encounters the same threat again . Yet it is unclear how exactly sepsis harms the function and representation of memory CD8 T cells , and the immune system in general . Jensen et al . investigated this question , first by showing that sepsis leads to a profound loss of memory CD8 T cells , but that surviving memory CD8 T cells multiply quickly \u2013 especially a subpopulation known as central memory CD8 T cells \u2013 to re-establish the memory CD8 T cell population . Since the central memory CD8 T cells proliferate better than the other memory T cells this alters the overall composition of the pool of memory CD8 T cells , with central memory cells becoming overrepresented . Further experiments revealed that this biasing toward central memory T cells , due to sepsis , created long-term changes in the distribution of memory CD8 T cells throughout the body . The way the genetic information of these cells was packaged had also been altered , as well as which genes were switched on or off . Overall , these changes reduced the ability of memory CD8 T cells to control infections .

In the United States alone, nine people die each year, and nine of those individuals are also infected with a bacterium called L. monocytogenes. The infection is triggered by an immune response called cytokine storm, which is activated by the body\u2019s own immune system. However, it is not clear how these immune cells respond to the infection. To address this question, Jensen et al. used mice to study the immune responses of patients who had been exposed to an infection with the cytokines storm. These experiments showed that the response of the cells that survive the inflammation storm is similar to those of healthy individuals. This suggests that these cells may be able to respond more quickly to infection than those that do not survive. Furthermore, the amount of memory CD8 T cells in the blood of these patients is much higher than in healthy people, suggesting that they are still at increased risk for mortality, even if they have been treated with early treatment. Further experiments revealed that when a person is infected by a bacteria or virus, they lose the ability to recognize the presence of a specific antigen in their blood. Moreover, when the bacteria and virus re-encounter with their cognate antigen, these T cell cells are less capable of responding to this antigen. Finally, if and to what extent these new cells recover from the inflammatory response, this could lead to long-term health problems. Future studies are needed to understand how this process works in humans and other animals."

These sequences of DNA are found in many organisms and can make up a significant proportion of the genetic material: almost 50% of the DNA in the case of the human genome . Transposable elements are grouped by how they move to new locations in a genome . Some move by a cut-and-paste mechanism\u2014whereby the transposable element DNA is removed from one location and inserted back at a new genomic location . Others , termed retrotransposons , move by a copy-and-paste mechanism: the DNA sequence is transcribed into an RNA intermediate , and then copied back into DNA before being inserted into a new location . Retrotransposons can accumulate to great numbers in genomes: and one retrotransposon , called LINE-1 , is present at an estimated 500 , 000 copies in the human genome . Although most copies of LINE-1 are inactive , the average human genome contains about 80\u2013100 that are predicted to be able to \u2018jump\u2019 to new locations . Given that these retrotransposons could insert into , and disrupt , vital genes , it follows that our cells would have evolved ways to limit their movement . An enzyme named APOBEC3A is known to limit the movement of LINE-1 retrotransposons in cells . APOBEC3A can alter the letters , or bases , that make up the genetic code . This enzyme acts on single-strand DNA to change \u2018C\u2019 bases to \u2018U\u2019 bases , which could explain how APOBEC3A combats LINE-1 . However , no evidence for such mutation of LINE-1 sequences by APOBEC3A had been found to date . Now , Richardson et al . recreate the copying of LINE-1 RNA back into DNA in a test tube\u2014and reveal that APOBEC3A can mutate single-strand LINE-1 DNA . Critically , as long as the RNA intermediate and DNA copy remain together , the LINE-1 DNA is protected . However , when LINE-1 inserts into a new location the temporarily exposed single strand of LINE-1 DNA becomes susceptible to mutation by APOBEC3A . Human cells can detect and destroy \u2018U\u2019 bases in DNA\u2014and only by inhibiting this ability were Richardson et al . able to observe APOBEC3A mutations in new LINE-1 copies within the genomes of living cells . Richardson et al . speculate that the activity of APOBEC3 enzymes must strike a balance between limiting the spread of retrotransposons and minimizing the mutation of the cell's own DNA . Future work could address important questions , such as: do APOBEC enzymes affect the \u2018jumping\u2019 of LINE-1 retrotransposons in human reproductive cells and the early embryo , where new LINE-1 insertions could be passed on to subsequent generations ? Also , does a loss of APOBEC3 activity lead to new LINE-1 insertions in cancerous cells ? And does this effect how tumors form and/or progress ? Since APOBEC3 enzymes can cause mutations in cancers , they have been proposed as new targets for anti-cancer drugs\u2014therefore , it is crucial to uncover any harmful effects of inhibiting APOBEC3 enzymes that might limit the effectiveness of such treatments .",

In humans, this protein is active in a number of different ways. One of these is by deaminating DNA that arises during the process of inserting a new DNA strand into the cell\u2019s DNA. These DNA strands are then exposed to a molecule called uridine nucleotides ( or UTRs for short ) that can be used as a template to repair DNA damage. Previous studies have shown that the enzyme that codes for this enzyme can inhibit the activity of LINE elements, but it was not clear how it could do so. Now, Levin et al. have used a technique called cell assays to study the effects of A1A on the ability of a cell to detect and remove L2 elements from its DNA in cultured cells. They found that a cytidine-deaminase inhibitor protein ( UGI ) is one of seven enzymes that inhibits the formation of L3 elements in human cells, while another eight enzymes are involved in this process. Together, these findings provide a better understanding of how the A2A enzyme is able to block the assembly of long-intersperated elements."

The brain responds to this varying input by adjusting its own activity levels and even its own structure . It does this by changing the strength of the connections between neurons , or the properties of the neurons themselves . Known as plasticity , this process of continuous change enables the brain to develop , learn and to recover from injury . The visual systems of mammals are particularly well suited to studying how sensory experience alters the brain . Studies in animals show that lack of sensory input to one or both eyes during a critical period in development causes long-lasting changes in the brain\u2019s visual circuits . Similarly , children with the condition amblyopia or \u2018lazy eye\u2019 \u2013 in which one eye has impaired vision and the brain ignores input from that eye \u2013 can end up with permanent deficits in their vision if the condition is not treated during childhood . Changes in sensory input are thought to trigger plasticity in the brain by altering the activity of specific genes . But exactly how this process works is unclear . Moore , Richards et al . now show that a gene called Rem2 has an important role in regulating visual plasticity . In the key experiments , young mice had their vision in one eye blocked for a few days . Analysis of their brains showed that mice that had been genetically modified to lack the Rem2 gene responded differently to this change in their environment ( i . e . the loss of input to one eye ) than their normal counterparts . Further experiments suggest that Rem2 regulates the excitability of individual neurons: that is , how much the neurons respond to any given input . In the absence of Rem2 , neurons in visual areas of the brain become hyperactive . This prevents them from adjusting their activity levels in response to changes in sensory input , which in turn leads to impaired plasticity . Being able to harness the brain\u2019s visual plasticity mechanisms on demand , for example by regulating Rem2 activity , could benefit individuals with disorders such as amblyopia . Rem2 is also active in many other parts of the brain besides those that support vision . This suggests that manipulating this gene could affect numerous forms of plasticity .

The experiments show that mice lacking the gene for a protein that encodes the Ras-like protein are less responsive to visual stimuli than normal mice. This suggests that this is due to a process called \u2018Ocular dominance plasticity\u2019, in which the neurons switch on or off their excitability and switch back on their electrical activity in response to sensory experiences. Further experiments showed that the levels of the protein were altered in mice that lacked this gene. In the experiments, these mice were exposed to light and were unable to move their eyes towards the left or right side of their vision. These mice also showed increased spontaneous firing rates, suggesting that they had lost a key molecule that regulates how the brain works. Together these findings suggest that a group of molecules known as REM2 regulates this process in a way that is similar to that found in other molecules that regulate other aspects of sensory perception. MARDINLY and his colleagues then used a technique called immunoblotting to study the effects of this change in activity on the mouse visual circuit. They found that when the mice did not lack the enzyme, they were more likely to produce more of it in their visual cortex than they did when they received light. By contrast, when a mouse lacked the molecule, their brains were less able to process the information they needed to make decisions about how to use the eye. Overall, this work provides a new model for understanding how visual experience influences the development of our visual systems. Future work will focus on identifying the next steps in this research."

Certain animal species can sense the Earth\u2019s magnetic field for the purposes of navigation . How that compass sense works is perhaps the last true mystery of sensory biology . If we knew how the magnetic field affects the activity of nerve cells , we could harness that mechanism to create new biomedical tools . One technological goal is to genetically engineer specific cells in the brain or elsewhere so their activity can be controlled using an external magnet . This dream has been called \u201cmagnetogenetics\u201d . In recent months a string of reports claimed to have solved both the scientific and the technological challenges of magnetogenetics . They all involved the discovery or the engineering of protein molecules that are sensitive to magnetic fields . Markus Meister has now checked whether those claims were consistent with well-established physical laws . For each case , Meister calculated how strongly the protein in question would link magnetic fields to cellular activity . The results show that the predicted effects are too weak to account for the reported measurements by huge margins: between five and ten orders of magnitude . It therefore appears that none of these reports have hit on a solution to magnetogenetics . All of the proposed proteins use iron atoms to couple to the magnetic field , but Meister concludes that these proteins contain far too few iron atoms . How safe is that conclusion ? There has been enormous technological interest in making tiny magnets; for example , to design the ever-denser data storage drives inside computers . Hence the magnetism of small clusters of atoms is exceedingly well understood . If any of the biological reports of magnetogenetics turned out correct , they would force a revolutionary rethinking of basic physics . With the recognition that magnetogenetics remains unsolved , and that different approaches are needed , Meister hopes that other investigators will feel motivated to continue innovating in this area .",

However, it is not clear how magnetic fields interact with biological molecules and cells. To investigate this question, Stanley et al. used a technique called magnetosensation to study the properties of a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide a bacterium through the muck at the bottom of the cell. The experiments show that the protein is made from a molecule called ferritin, which is a type of magnetite that is found in many different types of bacteria. In the experiments, the proteins were attached to an ion channel protein called TRPV4 and then tugged on it by a magnetic force. This tugging on the magnetin made the molecule move in a way that made it move along the field lines. But it was not known how this was possible, or how it could be used to manipulate the activity of other molecules in the same way. It is also unclear how magnetism works in animals and how the cells respond to this kind of magnetic energy. Stanley and co. now propose a new method to use magnetically sensitive cells in which the molecules are pulled in different directions by different magnetic forces. Using this method, they found that, at room temperature, a single molecule of iron can be pulled into a region within a cell called the cytoskeleton. When the iron is heated to a high enough temperature that it can open up a channel, this channel opens up, allowing the ions to flow in. These results suggest that this is the only way to make cells more sensitive to magnetic energies. A future challenge will be to find out more about the mechanisms that might be involved in this process."

Once partitioned into the ganglion mother cell , the Prospero protein enters the nucleus , where it switches off \u2018stem cell genes\u2019 and switches on \u2018neuron genes\u2019 so the ganglion mother cell can form the mature neurons of the brain . Thus , neuroblasts must keep Prospero out of the nucleus to maintain stem cell properties , whereas ganglion mother cells must move Prospero into the nucleus to form neurons . Now , Lai and Doe discover a new way that the Prospero protein is used to control stem cell biology . Neuroblasts , like all stem cells , can enter periods where they go dormant or quiescent\u2014that is , they temporarily stop generating ganglion mother cells . By analyzing which proteins are present in neuroblasts during this transition to quiescence , Lai and Doe discovered that the Prospero protein was briefly detected , at low levels , in the nucleus of the neuroblast just before it became dormant . To see whether this \u2018low-level pulse\u2019 of nuclear Prospero is linked to the cell entering a dormant state , Lai and Doe investigated two types of mutant fly in which neuroblasts become dormant either earlier or later than in normal flies . A low-level pulse of nuclear Prospero still precisely matched the start of the dormant state in both mutants . When the Prospero protein was removed altogether , the neuroblasts failed to become dormant , and instead continued dividing . Lai and Doe propose that different levels of Prospero distinguish three different fates for neuroblasts . Neuroblasts self-replicate when Prospero is kept out of the nucleus , become dormant when exposed to low level nuclear Prospero , and produce the mature cells of the brain when nuclear Prospero levels are high . Exactly how the intermediate levels of nuclear Prospero trigger the dormant state remains a question for future work , as is the question of whether the related mammalian protein , called Prox1 , has a similar function . Understanding how stem cells switch between cell division and quiescence is important for developing effective stem cell-based therapies . It could also help us understand cancer , as cancer cells go through similar periods of inactivity , during which they do not respond to many anti-tumor drugs .",
        "first_gen": "Stem cells can self-renew, differentiate, or enter quiescence. When a cell divides, the stem cells divide to form a new daughter cell, called a ganglion mother cell ( GMC ). However, it is not clear how this process works. Drosophila neuroblasts are a model system for studying stem cell activity in animals. They are found in fruit flies and other mammals, and they are thought to be involved in the development of new tissues and organs. One way to study the activity of these cells is by studying how they switch between differentiating and dividing states. A protein called Miranda ( which is also known as Prospero ) controls the formation of the daughter cells. This protein is produced by a group of cells called neural progenitors, which are made up of a scaffolding protein and a gene that is transcribed into a transcriptional repressor. These cells are able to differentiate and divide, but it remains unclear how these pathways work. To investigate this question, Tsuji et al. used a technique called immunofluorescence staining to measure the levels of an RNA molecule that surrounds the neuroblast nucleus. The experiments show that when the Neuroblast precursor protein Miranda is detected in a region called the nucleus, a protein that makes up the cell\u2019s DNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it forms a unique molecular profile. Further experiments showed that the level of this protein was high enough to distinguish between the two types of neuroplasts: low enough for them to become pluripotent, high for dividing and low for differentiation. In contrast, low levels were observed in mutant neuroflasts that lacked the ability to divide and differentiate. Finally, these findings suggest that a pulse of low level nuclear energy is required to drive the proliferation of mutant Neuroblast cells, whereas high levels are required for the differentiation process."

A protein shell called a capsid protects the virus during this journey . But the structure of the capsid presents a mystery . How can this protein shell be strong enough to remain intact as it enters a host cell , and yet quickly open up to release the viral genome after replication ? Unlike the capsids of many other viruses , those of HIV have irregular structures that rapidly fall apart once removed from the virus . This has thwarted attempts to study intact HIV capsids in order to understand how they work . However , we do know that HIV hijacks a range of molecules produced by the invaded host cell . Dissecting their effects on the capsid is key to understanding how the capsid disassembles . M\u00e1rquez et al . have now developed a method that can visualize individual HIV capsids \u2013 and how they disassemble \u2013 in real time using single-molecule microscopy . This revealed that capsids differ widely in their stability . The shell remains closed for a variable period of time and then collapses catastrophically as soon as it loses its first subunit . Using the new technique , M\u00e1rquez et al . also found that a small molecule drug called PF74 causes the capsid to crack open rapidly , but the remaining shell is then stabilized against further disassembly . These observations reconcile seemingly contradictory observations made by different research groups about how this drug affects the stability of the capsid . The method developed by M\u00e1rquez et al . enables researchers to measure how molecules produced by host cells interact with the viral capsid , a structure that is fundamental for the virus to establish an infection . It could also be used to test the effects of antiviral drugs that have been designed to target the capsid . The new technique has already been instrumental in related research by Mallery et al . , which identifies a molecule found in host cells that stabilizes the capsid of HIV .",
        "first_gen": "HIV is an enveloped virus that carries its RNA genome and associated viral proteins inside a protein shell called the capsid. When the virus enters the host\u2019s body, it releases the viral DNA into the cytoplasm, where it is packaged into double stranded DNA. In order to establish infection, the capid needs to be able to release its DNA in the correct place and time. This process is known as \u201cuncoating\u201d, and it involves a process called \u2018unzipping\u2018, in which a viral protein is released from the cell membrane and then disassemble into two-dimensional structures called capsids. However, there is no way to precisely follow this process. Now, Francis et al. have used a technique called single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to observe the uncoatings of hundreds of individual viral particles in a single experiment. The experiments show that a molecule called PF74, which binds to a group of proteins called arginine clusters, slows the disassembly process and prevents the particles from being disassembled. Further experiments showed that the enzymes involved in disassembling the viruses are also responsible for the assembly of the proteins and other molecules that are needed for HIV to enter the body. These findings suggest that different enzymes and drugs may influence how HIV is disorganized. Future work will be needed to understand how these enzymes are regulated and how they can be controlled by different regulators."

Yet , sometimes a mutation can trigger a chain of genetic events that drives the cells to multiply uncontrollably , which leads to tumors . Identifying these \u2018driver mutations\u2019 is complex , but key to understanding how cancers start and can be fought . Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in women worldwide . Large studies have focused on sequencing the DNA of cancerous breast cells to try to identify the mutations that started the cancer . Results show that , in these cells , a biological mechanism called the JNK signaling pathway is often inactivated because mutations affect the molecules that take part in this process . Like a chain reaction , the proteins of the JNK pathway act on each other until the last one , called JNK , gets switched on . This protein then goes on to participate in a number of cellular processes such as DNA repair . Is it possible that mutations in this pathway actually drive cancer , and if so , how ? Girnius et al . addressed these questions by inactivating the JNK pathway in the breast cells of mice . Over the next year and a half , the JNK-deficient animals were more likely to get breast cancer than normal mice . Further experiments showed that , in breast cells , the JNK protein prevented tumors from appearing . However , once the tumors were present , it was less effective at stopping them from growing . The DNA of the breast cancer cells with no JNK protein also contained more genetic changes and mistakes . This suggests that the JNK signaling pathway helps to keep the genetic information \u2018healthy\u2019 . This may be because , normally , the JNK protein activates processes that fix DNA mutations . Taken together , the results presented by Girnius et al . show that genetic changes which inactivate the JNK pathway can drive the development of breast cancer . Certain anti-cancer drugs kill cancerous cells by damaging their DNA . Breast tumor cells with inactive JNK pathways are less able to repair their genetic information , and so these drugs could potentially work well on them . Future experiments will be needed to test this hypothesis .",

This pathway is made up of a number of genes that are involved in the production of proteins. However, it is not clear how these mutations contribute to breast cancer development. To find out, Garraway et al. used a technique called RNA sequencing to examine the genetic information of breast tumors. The analysis revealed that mutations that increase the risk of developing breast cancers were associated with the loss of the pathway\u2019s ability to promote tumor growth. These mutations caused the formation of new tumors in breast cells, which caused them to become more aggressive and aggressive. In addition, the mutations also increased the likelihood that the tumor would develop into a new type of cancer. Further analysis of human breast tumor genomic DNA showed that a protein called jNK promotes tumor development by activating a transcription factor called AP1 ( which is responsible for signaling ). Furthermore, mutations were found in other proteins that help the cell to grow and divide, such as the gene that encodes an enzyme called CDH1 and the protein that codes for AP2. Together, these findings suggest that this protein plays a key role in controlling the growth of tumors, but it remains to be seen whether it also promotes the development of other cancers."

To become active , many of these peptides need to be chemically modified . PAM is the only enzyme that carries out a type of peptide modification called amidation and it is essential for animals to grow and survive . PAM was originally thought to have evolved in the nervous system of animals , but recent studies have found that it is also present in green algae and in hair-like projections known as cilia , which are found on the surface of most animal cells . There are two types of cilia: motile cilia beat rhythmically and are responsible for moving cells and fluids , while non-motile cilia sense the external environment and serve as signaling hubs . These observations suggest that PAM may have other roles in cells in addition to activating peptides . Kumar et al . now set out to investigate the role of PAM in green algae , flatworms and mice . The results show that PAM is important for the formation of both motile and non-motile cilia . Reducing the levels of PAM in the algae and flatworms resulted in short stubs forming on the surface of cells instead of motile cilia . This reduced the ability of flatworms to glide around their environment . Furthermore , the cells of mutant mice lacking PAM produced non-motile cilia that were much shorter than those produced by normal mouse cells . Further experiments suggest that PAM may be involved in the transport of certain proteins to the sites where new cilia will form . The findings of Kumar et al . reveal a link between the PAM enzyme , amidation and the assembly of cilia . The next step will be to identify the molecules that are modified by PAM and work out exactly how amidated products might regulate the formation of cilia .",

The cilium is made up of many different types of cells, and it is important to understand how cilia work in different cell types. For example, a protein called oxytocin, which is found in many animals, is required for the cile to work properly. However, it has not been well understood how the activity of this protein is regulated. Kumar et al. have now identified an enzyme called peptidylglycine \u03b1-amidating monooxygenase ( PAM for short ) that is involved in the production of peptides and other molecules that can be transported from the inside of the cell to the outside of it. This enzyme is needed to make the proteins that are needed for ciliogenesis, but it was not clear what role this enzyme plays in regulating the assembly of these proteins. To investigate this, Kumar and colleagues used a technique called immunostaining to identify the enzyme in Chlamydomonas and mouse embryos. These experiments showed that the protein was present in a region called the Golgi and that it had abnormal levels of activity in this region. Further experiments revealed that a similar enzyme was required to assemble the pyrotechnic components that were found on the surface of other cells in mammalian cells. In the mice, the same enzyme did not work, suggesting that its activity was affected by changes in Golgids and cytosolic components. Together, these findings suggest that PAMP plays a key role in controlling ciliary assembly in both mammalian and non-mammalian cells and may help to explain why these diseases are so severe."

These cells are named after their long , hair-like protrusions called stereocilia , and mutations in the genes involved in stereocilia development and maintenance can lead to hearing loss in humans . Damage to the stereocilia caused by excessive exposure to loud noises can also have the same effect . Stereocilia are full of filaments made of a protein called actin . Other proteins called class III myosins and Espin are also both required for normal development of stereocilia . Mutations in the genes that encode these proteins can cause hereditary deafness in humans . However , it remains unclear exactly how these two proteins ( myosins and Espin ) interact with each other in stereocilia . Using biochemical and structural studies , Liu , Li et al . have now discovered that the so-called \u2018tail\u2019 part of the myosins contains a pair of repeated sequences that can each interact with an Espin protein called Espin1 . This interaction allows each myosin to cross-link two Espin1 proteins . Espins assemble actin filaments into bundles , and further experiments showed that this cross-linking interaction between myosins and Espins helped this process , which is linked to stereocilia development and maintenance . Mammals actually have two related copies of class III myosins that play overlapping but slightly different roles . The next challenge will be to try to understand the differences between these related proteins , as well as to try to uncover the roles of other forms of Espin in stereocilia .",

However, it was not clear how the Myosins interact with Myin1, the protein that controls the formation of these bundles. Now, Wang et al. have used a technique called X-ray crystallography to examine the structure of the two proteins. The experiments revealed that a region called the tail homology I motif ( THDI ) is present at the tip of myin3. This region contains a pair of repeating sequences, known as \u2018repeat sequences\u2019, that can bind to the proteins that make up the filaments of a hair cell. Further experiments showed that this motif is also present in other species, including humans, mice and chickens. In the experiments, I3 was also found to be bound to another protein, called Ectoplasmic specialization protein 1, but it remained unclear how this protein was able to bind directly to it. By studying the structures of two other proteins found in different vertebrate cells, Mecklenburg and Diederichs have now identified a second region that is important for this binding. Together, these findings reveal a new mechanism by which the MYO3 protein interacts with the epinephrine transporter ( EECP ), a type of signaling molecule that helps to regulate the activity of other signaling molecules. More work is now needed to understand how these proteins work together."

Rapid changes in this so-called membrane potential activate vital biological processes , ranging from muscle contraction to communication between nerve cells . Ion channels are cellular structures that maintain membrane potential and help \u2018excitable\u2019 cells like nerve and muscle cells produce electrical impulses . They are specialized proteins that form highly specific conduction pores in the cell surface . When open , these channels let charged particles ( such as calcium ions ) through , rapidly altering the electrical potential between the inside and outside the cell . To ensure proper control over this process , most ion channels open in response to specific stimuli , which is known as \u2018gating\u2019 . For example , voltage-gated calcium channels contain charge-sensing domains that change shape and allow the channel to open once the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold . These channels play important roles in many tissues and , when mutated , can cause severe brain or muscle disease . Although the basic principle of voltage gating is well-known , the properties of individual voltage-gated calcium channels still vary . Different family members open at different voltage levels and at different speeds . Such fine-tuning is thought to be key to their diverse roles in various parts of the body , but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood . Here , Fern\u00e1ndez-Quintero , El Ghaleb et al . set out to determine how this variation is achieved . The first step was to create a dynamic computer simulation showing the detailed structure of a mammalian voltage-gated calcium channel , called CaV1 . 1 . The simulation was then used to predict the movements of the voltage sensing regions while the channel opened . The computer modelling experiments showed that although the voltage sensors looked superficially similar , they acted differently . The first of the four voltage sensors of the studied calcium channel controlled opening speed . This was driven by shifts in its configuration that caused oppositely charged parts of the protein to sequentially form and break molecular bonds; a process that takes time . In contrast , the fourth sensor , which set the voltage threshold at which the channel opened , did not form these sequential bonds and accordingly reacted fast . Experimental tests in muscle cells that had been engineered to produce channels with mutations in the sensors , confirmed these results . These findings shed new light on the molecular mechanisms that shape the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels . This knowledge will help us understand better how ion channels work , both in healthy tissue and in human disease .",

These channels carry electrical signals from the inside of cells to the outside, and they are responsible for the electrical activity of many cell types, including the nervous system, the heart and skeletal muscles. The calcium channel is made up of four helices, each of which contains positively charged residues in every third position. When calcium ions enter a cell, they move across the membrane to release energy into the surrounding cell. However, it is not clear how these ions interact with each other. To investigate this, Catterall et al. used cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of two different voltage sensing domains ( VSDs ) of the sodium channel CaV1. 1. This revealed that the two types of channels \u2013 known as active and resting states \u2013 have different properties. In the active state, calcium ion-pairs form a ring-like structure, while the resting state is controlled by a voltage-sensing domain ( called the \u2018sensor fold\u2019 ). Both of these states are active at different voltages, but it was not known how the different states of each channel are determined. Casterall and Wu then used a technique called computational modeling and electrophysiology to identify the molecular mechanisms by which different channels of calcium are activated and inactive. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic model for understanding how different ions behave in different vSD states."

        "ground_truth": "When part of the brain becomes damaged as a result of injury or disease \u2013 for example , a stroke \u2013 other brain regions can sometimes take over from the damaged part . This is one example of a phenomenon called brain plasticity . The strengthening and weakening of connections between neurons that underlies learning and memory is another , less extreme , example of plasticity . While the brain is most plastic during childhood , it remains malleable to some degree throughout life . The brain\u2019s visual system in particular shows robust and predictable plasticity , and so is often used by neuroscientists to study mechanisms behind plasticity . In young rodents , taping one eye shut for a few days causes inputs from that eye to visual areas of the brain to become weaker . Inputs from the open eye meanwhile become stronger , leading to improved vision in the open eye . Such plasticity also occurs in adult rodents , but the eye must be closed for longer to produce an effect . In young animals , this plasticity depends , in part , on enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . These help to regulate a network of proteins called the extracellular matrix , which provides structural support for cells . Pielecka-Fortuna et al . now provide the first evidence that MMP enzymes also contribute to visual plasticity in adult animals . Blocking the activity of MMPs prevented reorganisation of visual areas of the brains of adult mice in response to eye closure , and prevented vision improvements in the open eye . However , blocking MMP in adult mice whose brains had been damaged by a stroke had the opposite effect . Whereas stroke normally prevents visual system plasticity in response to eye closure , treatment with a single dose of MMP blocker rescued this plasticity . Strikingly , these benefits were lost if the mice were given two doses of MMP blocker , rather than one . These experiments show that MMP levels must be within a narrow range to support plasticity . In the healthy adult brain , blocking MMPs impairs plasticity . After stroke , MMP levels are increased and reducing them rescues plasticity . The next challenge is to identify the specific MMP enzymes responsible , and to determine whether these changes can be exploited to improve recovery from stroke .",
        "first_gen": "The visual cortex is a region of the brain that responds to changes in the environment, such as light and sound, and is important for learning and memory. In mammals, it is thought that the cortex can undergo plasticity by depriving one eye of pattern vision for several days, but little is known about the role of this process in adult brains. For example, a protein called Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are thought to play a key role in helping adult brain tissue repair and rewiring. However, there is little evidence to support this idea. To address this question, Spolidoro et al. studied mice that had been severely injured by a stroke. The experiments showed that mice with a brain injury that deprived the left and right eyes of patterns vision were more likely to have an open eye than those with an injured eye. Further experiments revealed that when the mice were deprived of a visual stimulus, they had a greater chance of developing a new vision. Moreover, mice without an injury had more open eyes, which helped them to recover from the injury. This suggests that an optimal level of activity is needed to allow the adult cortex to develop into a healthy and healthy brain."

Two neurons can communicate with each other by forming a synapse , a specialised structure where the two cells come into close contact . There , the signalling neuron releases chemicals that the receiving cell captures through dedicated receptors embedded in its membrane . For example , the AMPA receptor is a complex assemblage of different subunits that quickly transmits information by opening and closing to let ions move into the receiving cell . These receptors are some of the fastest to react to the released chemicals , allowing information to be encoded swiftly . In fact , it is increasingly clear that epilepsy and deficits in mental processes can be associated with AMPA receptors having a faulty activity . Yet , it is still unknown how exactly these proteins work . In particular , previous studies have shown that an AMPA receptor can go through dramatic changes in its structure , with the different subunits being able to spread apart widely . However , these experiments had to be conducted when the proteins were isolated from membranes and held in a cocktail of activating or deactivating molecules for hours . It is still unclear whether the results hold when AMPA receptors sit at the membrane while assembled with their partner proteins , like they normally do in the brain . Baranovic and Plested went on to investigate this question by using \u2018molecular rulers\u2019 . These tiny molecules have different lengths , and they act as yardsticks: their sticky ends can attach to specific areas in the protein , helping to measure how these regions move relative to each other when the receptors are on or off . A method called patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine how much the normal activity of the AMPA receptors was hindered by being bound by the molecular rulers . The results showed that AMPA receptors can undergo large structural changes but these movements require time and are much reduced by partner proteins . In the brain , AMPA receptors in synapses probably lack the freedom and opportunity to move so dramatically when neurons are communicating with each other . Ultimately , knowing how these receptors work and move may help grasp the changes in their activity that cause connections between neurons to become defective .",
        "first_gen": "Signal transduction at synapses in the brain involves the rapid activation of a protein called AMPA receptors. These receptors are made up of three layers formed from distinct domains and ligand-binding domains. The first layer is made of amino-terminal domains, and the second layer consists of ligands that bind to proteins called adenosine triphosphate ( or ADP for short ). When the receptor is activated, the two extracellular domains of the receptors switch into four-fold symmetry. However, it is not clear how these regions interact with each other. To investigate this, Meyerson et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of these receptors in detail. This revealed that the three-dimensional structures of receptors can change rapidly, depending on how long they are exposed to glutamate. Further experiments showed that these structures can undergo substantial lateral motions, even if they contain only one subunit ( called Stargazin ), which is required for the binding of glutamate-gated receptors to work properly. In the experiments, two subunits were added to the first sub-unit, while a second subsubunit was added. Together, these two groups formed a dimer-of-dimers that could be used as a template to manipulate the shape and size of each receptor layer. By contrast, a third sub unit, called MTS, could only be applied to a single layer of receptor, but it was not possible to measure how fast these changes were to occur. Here, Yu, Yelshanskaya, Zhao, D\u00fcrr, Zuber, Taschenberger, etc. examined the structures that were found in these experiments. They found that, when the glutamate receptor was activated at a synapse, only a short distance from the membrane was allowed to pass through the intermediate layer, allowing it to move in a stable, open-up manner. Furthermore, they observed that long-term exposure to high levels of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors could lead to rapid changes in how the protein binds to receptors, making it more likely that glutamate receptors will be able to be switched on and off at the same time. Understanding how this happens could help to develop new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease."

To defend the body , the immune system sends large numbers of immune cells to the gut , but it usually struggles to eliminate the parasites . Without deworming medication , the infection can last for many years . Scientists study helminth infections in the laboratory by using worms that naturally infect mice . Understanding exactly how the immune system responds to the infection is essential to grasp why it fails to clear the worms .

The standard procedure to obtain immune cells from the gut consists of three steps: collecting a gut segment and washing it , stripping away the surface layers with chemicals , and finally using enzymes to digest the tissues , which are then filtered to obtain individual cells . However , this protocol is not able to extract cells during infection . Ferrer-Font et al . therefore methodically refined every step of this method , and finally succeeded in obtaining millions of immune cells from infected guts .

However , these cells disappeared once the worms developed into adults . These findings were confirmed by microscopy , which also showed that the first responder cells were found around the developing larvae , likely attacking them . When the adult worms developed , these cells were replaced by other immune cells , which also decreased the longer the worms were present in the gut .

In addition, this technique can be used to identify the cells that are most likely to be active in a particular part of an infected animal. Recent advances in multi-cell analysis have greatly increased our understanding of multiple diseases, cell types and immune responses that have previously been difficult to detect. Svenson et \u00c1lvarez-Sorley have now used the technique to test the results of their experiments in mice that had been infected with the parasite. Further experiments showed that these cells were able to replicate the same immune response throughout the entire course of infection.

For example, a protein called the 20S proteasome is responsible for the degradation of a large number of other proteins. However, it is not clear how this process is regulated, or how it works. To investigate this question, Liepe et al. have used mathematical modelling to develop a mathematical model that can be used to model the activity of these enzymes. The model shows that the enzymes involved in the proteolysis process are different from those that are found in other cells. These enzymes are called \u2018proteins\u2019 and they can degrade many proteins at the same time, depending on the type of cell they are in. In the experiments, the models were then compared with the data collected by the model. This revealed that these proteins degrade more rapidly than those produced by other enzymes, but that this is largely because of interactions between the proteins and the regulatory sites that regulate their degradation. Further work is now needed to understand how these interactions are regulated."

To send a message to its neighbor , a neuron releases a molecule known as a neurotransmitter into the gap between the cells . The neurotransmitter binds to proteins on the recipient neuron and triggers new electrical signals inside that cell . When the message has been received , the neurotransmitter molecules are returned to the first neuron so that they can be reused . This recycling is particularly important in the visual system , where neurons communicate via rapid-fire signaling . In fruit flies , for example , light-sensitive neurons in the eye known as photoreceptors release a neurotransmitter called histamine when they detect light . Supporting cells called laminar glia take up any leftover histamine and combine it with another molecule known as \u03b2-alanine to form a larger molecule . The photoreceptors absorb this larger molecule and break it back down into histamine and \u03b2-alanine . However , it is not clear how the \u03b2-alanine returns to the glia to allow this cycle to continue . Many molecules rely on so-called \u201ctransporter\u201d proteins to help them move into or out of cells . To identify transporters that might help to move \u03b2-alanine , Han , Xiong et al . prepared a list of fruit fly genes that encode transporter proteins found inside the insect\u2019s head . Testing the resulting proteins in a cultured cell system revealed that one of them was able to transport \u03b2-alanine . This protein , named BalaT , is found in another type of support cell called retinal pigment cells . Mutant flies that cannot produce BalaT are blind because their photoreceptors have problems in transmitting information to other neurons . Han , Xiong et al . propose that BalaT transports \u03b2-alanine from photoreceptors to retinal pigment cells , which then pass \u03b2-alanine on to the laminar glia . Follow-up studies are required to find out exactly how the laminar glia take up histamine .",

The neurotransmitter histamine is released from the synaptic cleft, and is then transported to the photoreceptor cells that surround the synapse. However, it is not clear how this process works. A protein called carcinine, which is produced by a glial cell in the retina, is responsible for transporting the chemical signal. It is thought that this chemical is recycled by the glia cells, but it has been unclear how the process is carried out. Now, Xu, Chaturvedi et al. have identified a new transporter that is involved in this recycling process. This transporter is found in fruit flies and flies that have been genetically modified to be able to produce histamines and \u03b2-alanine. In the fruit fly Drosophila, a transporter called CarT is present in these cells and it was previously unknown how carT transports the molecules to retinal pigment cells. To investigate the role of CART in retinitis pigment cell production, Xing and Wang used a technique called CRISPR-associated single-guide RNA ( Cas9 ) to identify the transporter. These experiments show that CARTA transports carcinamine directly into retinas. Further experiments also showed that the gene that encodes this transporter was expressed and required to transport the molecule. Importantly, these findings suggest that a similar transporter may also be involved with the production of histam."

        "ground_truth": "While most animals experience a physiological decline as they age , the underlying cause of this decline is not fully understood . According to the free radical theory of aging , chemicals known as reactive oxygen species build up in the body and then cause damage to various components within cells , including DNA and proteins . These species , which include hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite , can cause substantial oxidative damage . However , while there is definitely a relationship between aging and reactive oxygen species , it remains possible that oxidative damage is a byproduct of aging rather than the cause of it . In the past researchers have measured the carbonylation of proteins ( that is , the oxidation of certain amino acids in proteins ) as a proxy for damage caused by reactive oxygen species , but this method has a number of shortcomings . More recently , it has become possible to quantify the oxidation state of cysteine , an amino acid that contains sulfur , in proteins using a technique based on mass spectrometry . Building on previous work in which they used this technique to measure the oxidation state of 300 proteins in vivo in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Brandes et al . have now determined how the oxidation state of these proteins changes over the lifespan of S . cerevisiae , which is a popular model system for analyzing aging in cells that are in a high metabolic state but are no longer dividing . This made it possible to identify protein targets that might\u2014as a result of changes in their oxidation state caused by reactive oxygen species\u2014contribute to the physiological alterations observed in aging organisms . It was also possible to establish a clear connection between the onset and extent of oxidative stress and lifespan . Brandes et al . discovered that several days before the yeast cells died , they underwent a sudden and global \u2018redox collapse\u2019 in which \u223c80% of the 300 proteins being studied experienced an increase in their oxidation state ( i . e . , they lost electrons ) . This event was preceded by a large drop in the level of NADPH , a coenzyme that , by being a source of electrons , helps to counterbalance the removal of electrons by reactive oxygen species within cells . The drop in the concentration of NADPH occurred very early in the life cycle of the yeast , and set in motion a series of events that down-regulated most cellular processes . Intriguingly , these findings are consistent with the effect of caloric restriction , a condition that is known to extend the lifespan of animals . Caloric restriction increases cellular NADPH and delays the down-regulation of cellular processes . Brandes et al . propose that the underlying cause of aging is not the accumulation of reactive oxygen species: rather , these results suggest that aging is caused by a sudden and substantial decrease in available NADPH , which means that cells cannot maintain a stable oxidation state . If borne out by further work , these findings could have a significant impact on how we think about the aging process , and could require researchers to rethink how they study aging .",
        "first_gen": "As we age, our bodies become less able to withstand the stresses that come with aging. This is partly because of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in our cells, which can cause damage to the cell\u2019s redox machinery. However, it is not clear how ROS accumulates in the cells and how it affects the lifespan of an organism. Now, Brandes et al. have used a technique called OxICAT to measure the levels of hundreds of different proteins in yeast cells grown in a laboratory. The experiments show that when a yeast cell is exposed to a high level of oxidative stress, the enzyme that produces the oxidant, superoxide dismutase ( or catalase for short ) is used to oxidize the proteins. When this enzyme is switched on, a large number of proteins are oxidized, and the enzymes that produce these oxidants are switched off. These changes are known as \u201credox collapse\u201d, but it was not known whether these changes were caused by a decrease in ROS levels, or whether they were triggered by the release of endogenous ROS. In the future, these findings may help scientists to better understand the role of ROS in aging in living organisms."

However , only one of these forms is used to make proteins: the more abundant L-amino acids are linked together to make proteins , whereas the scarcer D-amino acids are not . This \u2018homochirality\u2019 is common to all life on Earth . The molecular machinery inside cells that manufactures proteins involves many enzymes that carry out different tasks . Among these is an enzyme called DTD ( short for D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase ) , which prevents D-amino acids being incorporated into proteins . To do this , DTD must be able to recognise and remove the D forms of many different amino acids before they are taken to the growing protein by transfer RNA molecules . However , the details of this process are not fully understood . To investigate this mechanism , Ahmad et al . made crystals of the DTD enzyme in complex with a molecule that mimics a D-amino acid attached to a transfer RNA molecule . By studying this structure at a high resolution , Ahmad et al . were able to identify how the active site of DTD can specifically accommodate the \u2018chiral centre\u2019 of a complex made of a D-amino acid and a transfer RNA molecule . DTD is able to recognize D-amino acids because of a critical dipeptide that is inserted from one subunit of the DTD into the active site of another subunit of the enzyme . The effect of this dipeptide is to generate a binding pocket that is a perfect fit for the chiral centre of a complex that contains a D-amino acid and a transfer RNA molecule . Moreover , this pocket specifically excludes complexes that contain an L-amino acid . The crucial parts of DTD that form the binding pocket are highly conserved\u2014that is , they are the same in a wide variety of organisms , from bacteria to mammals . This conservation suggests that DTD is crucial for ensuring homochirality throughout all forms of life . Intriguingly , DTD is particularly highly expressed in neurons which are abundant in D-amino acids: this indicates that the DTD enzyme has an important physiological role , which will certainly be the focus of future work .",

To find out, Bhatt et al. have used a technique called crystallography to reveal the structure of a structure called a \u2018cross-subunit\u2019 that allows the enzyme to selectively remove only the two amino acids that it mistakenly attaches to. This is known as a proofreading step, but it was not known how it works in living organisms. Now, Zheng, Wydau and Zhang have solved the molecular basis of an enzyme that selectively removes only two of these amino acid residues. The enzyme uses an invariant structure to capture the chiral centre of each amino-acid, which prevents it from getting incorporated into the protein. In addition, the crystal structure revealed that the dTD enzyme can also remove the other two residues from the mRNA molecule, and that this allows it to avoid being inserted into proteins. Further work is now needed to understand how the mechanism of this process works."

Mutations in the genes that encode CFTR may reduce the number of pores at the cell surface or stop them from working properly . When this happens , these cells cannot transport enough chloride , which causes the disease cystic fibrosis . CFTR contains two regions that lie inside the cell known as nucleotide binding domains ( NBDs ) . These domains bind to the chemical energy molecule ATP , and when ATP does bind , two NBDs associate to form a dimer and the pore in CFTR opens . The CFTR channel can occasionally open in a spontaneous way that does not require ATP . However , it was not clear whether NBDs also formed dimers when CFTR opened in this way . This is because spontaneous opening could reflect NBDs occasionally forming a dimer without ATP binding or it could occur when the pore occasionally opens without the NBDs forming a dimer . To explore whether opening of the pore always requires NBD dimerization , Mih\u00e1lyi et al . studied the behaviour of single human CFTR channels produced in frog eggs . Normal channels and mutant ones ( which show differences in spontaneous opening ) were used , and the change in the way NBDs interacted when the channels spontaneously opened or closed was investigated . Mih\u00e1lyi et al . found that the NBD dimer forms when the pore spontaneously opens , demonstrating that this step happens both with and without ATP . The result demonstrates that NBD dimer formation and pore movement are strictly coupled and that this is an inbuilt property of the CFTR protein . When ATP binds , this only changes how stable the open-pore and closed-pore structures of CFTR are but does not alter the fundamental architecture of the channel . These new findings will be of interest to researchers studying a large group of transport proteins related to CFTR called ABC proteins . Furthermore , a drug called ivacaftor stimulates spontaneous opening of CFTR , and has recently been approved for clinical use to treat people with mutations in CFTR . As such , the new findings will be also useful to help researchers understand how ivacaftor stimulates the CFTR pore to open .",

However, it is not clear what causes the open-to-closed-pore gating. Vergani et al. have now used a mutant version of the gene for a drug called ivacaftor to investigate this question. The mutant gene mutated in CF patients has a small open probability of opening and closing, but it was not known whether this was the case in other mutant CF cells. In the mutant mutant, the opening of a channel without ATP was also strictly coupled to the closure of another channel that had been previously shown to open and close with the addition of an arginine ( R555 ) to a threonine. Further experiments showed that the opposite is also true for the closed channel and open channel. These results suggest that a combination of mutations in one gene and a mutation in another gene can lead to spontaneous opening or closing of both channels. Furthermore, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that drive the formation of new channels and how these can be used to treat patients with CF."

A cell\u2019s membrane is made up of two layers of molecules with oily tails , and is therefore known as a bilayer . Many proteins are dotted within and on the inner and outer surfaces of the bilayer: some act as channels that control what goes in and out of the cell , while others protrude outside the cell so that they can sense changes in the environment . Membrane proteins can move and interact within the bilayer , and various models have emerged to try to explain this dynamic system . These models are based on the membrane having some fluidity but also having regions where there is more structure , and typically describe the proteins as ordered clusters floating in an otherwise disordered fluid membrane . However , many researchers now think some proteins that pass through both layers of the bilayer ( i . e . , transmembrane proteins ) make membranes more ordered , with a possibly gel-like state . However , it is not clear how transmembrane proteins can move and assemble together within such a relatively rigid membrane . To investigate this , Katira , Mandadapu , Vaikuntanathan et al . carried out computer simulations using a model of a simple bilayer membrane . This membrane can exist in an ordered state , where the oily tails are neatly aligned , or a disordered state , where they are irregularly packed . Virtual \u2018heating\u2019 of the membrane caused it to shift from an ordered to a disordered state . When a simple transmembrane protein favoring the disordered state was inserted into the ordered state of the modeled membrane , disordered regions formed locally around the protein and the protein was able to diffuse within the membrane . Modeling what would happen if two transmembrane proteins approached each other revealed that a consequence of the order\u2013disorder transition is a strong attractive force that assembles the proteins together . Katira , Mandadapu , Vaikuntanathan et al . named this new phenomenon the 'orderphobic effect' . The forces arising from this effect were much greater than those currently believed to contribute to the assembly of membrane protein complexes , such as those generated by the elasticity of the membrane . This means that the orderphobic effect may be responsible for generating the protein clusters commonly seen in cell membranes . Future work should next explore the opposite effect , where proteins favoring the ordered state are inserted into the disordered state of a membrane . This is expected to cause clustering of such proteins and thus large ordered regions in an otherwise disordered membrane .",

For example, a protein called dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) is found in the membrane of a lipid bilayer. When two proteins approach each other, they form an interface that separates the ordered phase from the disordered phase. This interaction is known as the \u201corderphobic effect\u201d. The order of the transition between order and disorder phases is determined by the amount of energy that passes between the two phases. However, it is not clear how the order\u2013disorder transition occurs. Marrink et al. have now used a large-scale molecular simulation to investigate this phenomenon. In the simulation, the proteins are embedded in a structure called an ordered membrane. A protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to the thickness of that membrane stabilizes this interface and prevents the protein from forming an order-disordered interface. Using a technique called Fourier analysis, these proteins were able to assemble because they had a regular, non-tail-end layer that was smaller than that of their ordered counterparts. Further experiments showed that the same protein can also assemble when two different phases are joined together. These results suggest that a pre-transition effect exists for the first order transition, and that it can be used to control the movement of other proteins. Future work is now needed to understand how this effect arises."

Another way to study neuronal activity is by using molecules that change how they interact with light when calcium binds to them , since changes in calcium concentration can be indicative of neuronal spiking . That change can be observed with specialized microscopes know as two-photon fluorescence microscopes . Using calcium indicators , it is possible to simultaneously record hundreds or even thousands of neurons . However , calcium fluorescence and spikes do not translate one-to-one . In order to interpret fluorescence data , it is important to understand the relationship between the fluorescence signals and the spikes associated with individual neurons . The only way to directly measure this relationship is by using calcium imaging and electrical recording simultaneously to record activity from the same neuron . However , this is extremely challenging experimentally , so this type of data is rare . To shed some light on this , Huang , Ledochowitsch et al . used mice that had been genetically modified to produce a calcium indicator in neurons of the visual cortex and simultaneously obtained both fluorescence measurements and electrical recordings from these neurons . These experiments revealed that , while the majority of time periods containing multi-spike neural activity could be identified using calcium imaging microscopy , on average , less than 10% of isolated single spikes were detectable . This is an important caveat that researchers need to take into consideration when interpreting calcium imaging results .

To investigate this question, Pachitariu et al. used a technique called \u201cfluorescent calcium indicator\u201d ( or GECI for short ) microscopy to measure the amount of light that travels from the cell to the brain. The experiments were performed with a microscope in which a single neuron was surrounded by a large field-of-view containing many thousands of neurons. In the experiments, the cells were exposed to light from a nearby microscope, and the images were then imaged using the same technique. This revealed that most of the changes associated with individual spikes were detected under optimal conditions, but only a small number of spikes occurred. Moreover, most spikes did not occur under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that the effect of fluorescence on activity may be different for each individual neuron, which may make it difficult to interpret the results of these experiments. Here, Berens, Daigle, Dominguez and Daigerle compared the performance of different types of mouse lines that could be used in population imaging experiments to investigate how neurons communicate. First, mice were genetically engineered to be able to produce a fluorescent protein called GCaMP6f. Second, these mice had fewer neurons than normal mice, so they were less likely to detect spikes. Finally, in contrast to their normal mouse counterparts, some neurons were found to show spikes that were more common in healthy mice. Overall, this work provides a better understanding of how calcium signals are detected in human populations and will help researchers to develop new and future imaging datasets."

The sex roles of these Brazilian cave insects are also reversed: females compete over the males , who in turn are selective of their female partners . This sex role reversal likely evolved within Neotrogla because the males\u2019 semen represents a rich and reliable source of energy within a nutrient-poor cave environment . When females are not using semen to fertilize their eggs , they consume it . Yet , while other animals show sex role reversal , Neotrogla species alone have reversed sexual organs . Neotrogla penises are spiky and may have evolved so that females can anchor themselves to males and then mate for prolonged periods . This would allow the females to stock up on the nutritious semen . Compared to their closest relatives , Neotrogla species can hold twice as much semen within their sperm storage organs . Scientists have speculated that a valve-like structure within this organ enables this extra storage by allowing the female to redirect semen into two separate chambers . But the organ\u2019s small size has made it difficult to determine its inner workings , and scientists have yet to discover a switching valve that serves such a purpose within the animal kingdom . Yoshizawa et al . examined three Neotrogla species using advanced imaging technology and detected the first example of a biological switching valve . Neotrogla females can control this valve , switching the flow of semen between two slots . In this way , females can store two batches of semen at once . Seemingly exploiting this adaptation , the females\u2019 spiky penises help them restrain males until they have received multiple semen injections . Yoshizawa et al . therefore suggest the emergence of this valve within the sperm storage organ may have promoted the evolution of the female penis .

In the process, the sperm is then stored in a capsule that can be used as a food source. When the semen is injected into the vesicles of another female, a switch valve is inserted between the two sclerites to allow the fluid to flow in and outwards. These mechanisms are similar to those found in other animals, such as the barklice, and are thought to have evolved during the evolution of this species of insect. It was not known how the mechanism of switching valves evolved or what role it played in its evolution.

Membrane fusion is carried out by a group of proteins called SNAREs . These proteins are embedded on the membranes of both the vesicle and its target , and they bind to each other to form a tight complex . This complex docks the vesicle to the target and then acts like a \u201czipper\u201d to pull the two membranes close enough to fuse . The best-studied SNARE proteins act in nerve cells and fuse vesicles to the cell\u2019s membrane in order to release molecules called neurotransmitters .

Next , the binding progressed to the middle domain , then to the C-terminal domain and finally to the linker domain . An intermediate , half-zippered form was also observed . Ma et al . next analysed each domain in more detail and found that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains drive the docking of vesicles to the target membrane , the middle domain is crucial for assembling the SNARE complex correctly , and all three domains regulate the fusing of the membranes . Further experiments showed that Munc18-1 promoted the assembly of new SNARE complexes and stabilized the half-zippered form , rather than stabilizing the complex after it had fully assembled . This study will provide a new tool to examine many other proteins that regulate SNARE assembly , and a basis to understand the role of SNARE proteins in brain activity .",

Yet , during rapid eye movement sleep ( the sleep phase in which dreaming occurs ) , the electrical activity of the brain is similar to the one recorded during wakefulness , making it difficult to distinguish these states based on EEG alone . EEG records brain activity in the shape of rhythmic waves whose frequency , shape and amplitude vary depending on the state of consciousness . In the EEG signal from the human brain , the higher frequency waves are weaker than the low-frequency waves: a measure known as spectral slope reflects the degree of this difference in the signal strength . Previous research suggests that spectral slope can be used to distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia and non-REM sleep . Here , Lendner et al . explored whether certain elements of the spectral slope could also discern wakefulness from all states of reduced arousal . EEG readings were taken from patients and volunteers who were awake , asleep or under anesthesia , using electrodes placed either on the scalp or into the brain . Lendner et al . found that the spectral slope could distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia , deep non-REM and REM sleep . The changes in the spectral slope during sleep could accurately track the degree of arousal with great temporal precision and across a wide range of time scales . This method means that states of consciousness can be spotted just from a scalp EEG . In the future , this approach could be embedded into the techniques used for monitoring sleep or anesthesia during operations; it could also be harnessed to monitor other low-response states , such as comas .",
        "first_gen": "Sleep is a state of unconsciousness that cycles between rapid and non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM ) and general anesthesia. Both sleep stages and anesthesia are characterized by an increase in activity in the electroencephalogram ( EEG ), which measures the electrical activity of the brain\u2019s nervous system. However, neither sleep stage nor anesthesia is thought to be the same as wakefulness. Instead, the EEG is used to measure the level of arousal in a brain state called \u201cwakefulness\u201d. This means that it is possible to distinguish sleep from awakefulness in humans, but this is not always the case. Now, Prerau et al. have used EEG recordings from 20 healthy people to investigate whether sleep is actually awake or sleep-like. The results show that both sleep phases and awake states of reduced arousal are distinct from each other. These findings suggest that a common electrophysiological marker, called the \u2018electroencephalography power spectrum\u2018, can distinguish between awake and asleep states. Further experiments showed that the spectral slope of EEG activity is much lower during sleep than during awake sleep. In contrast, it was much higher during the awake state and lower when awake. Furthermore, when the electrodes were placed on the scalp, they were less sensitive to electrical signals than they would be under anesthesia, suggesting that sleep may be more awake than awake in both wake and REM sleep, depending on how much of an electrical signal is switched on and off. Finally, these findings reveal that EEG measurements can be used as a proxy to determine whether a person is awake, asleep or awake at any given time. It is also important to understand how the human brain responds to drugs, such as propofol and barbiturates, and how these drugs affect brain activity."

Yet this is not all that chloroplasts do . For example , if a harmful microbe infects the plant , its chloroplasts rapidly change shape and move toward the cell\u2019s nucleus \u2013 the compartment of the cell that contains the bulk of the plant\u2019s genetic material . The chloroplasts then send warning signals to the nucleus that boost the plant\u2019s defenses . In 2015 , researchers showed that , during an infection , tiny tubes called stromules extend out from chloroplasts and make contact with the nucleus . Stromules are flexible structures that can extend and retract . However , it is not yet understood what exactly the stromules do , or how they establish connections with the nucleus . Some scientists had suggested the internal skeleton of the cell \u2013 a complex network of protein filaments called actin and microtubules \u2013 might regulate the movements of the stromules . Now , Kumar , Park et al . \u2013 including several researchers from the 2015 study \u2013 have monitored the interaction between stromules and this internal \u201ccytoskeleton\u201d in leaf cells from a plant called Nicotiana benthamiana . Stromules , microtubules and actin were marked with fluorescent tags , which allowed them to be tracked under a microscope . This showed that the stromules actively extend along microtubules and anchor to a network of actin filaments . Further work showed that chloroplasts move in the direction of the stromules . This suggests that chloroplast movement may actually be directed by these structures . This movement was seen in healthy plants growing under normal conditions , suggesting that it may be a more general occurrence in plants . Next , Kumar , Park et al . used a viral protein to provoke an immune response in the plants , and saw that a larger number of chloroplasts moved and clustered around the nucleus . This chloroplast clustering was also guided by stromules anchored to the actin filaments that surround the nucleus . These findings shed new light on how chloroplasts communicate with the nucleus . Future work is needed to determine if stromules just guide chloroplast movement or if they provide a physical force that drives this process .",
        "first_gen": "Stromules are tubular structures that extend along the surface of the chloroplasts of plants and animals. They are found in many genera in the plant kingdom, but they are most common in non-green plastids. In plants, stromule extension is controlled by a group of proteins called actin microfilaments ( or MTs ) and microtubules, which are attached to the cell\u2019s nuclei. These structures are known to be active during an innate immune response. However, it was not clear how these structures work during innate immunity. To investigate this, Caplan et al. used a technique called transmission electron microscopy to study the movement of a type of cell called leaf epidermal cells. The experiments show that when a plant is exposed to a chemical shock, the stroma extends along its chloroplast. This extension causes the cells to become more flexible, and the length of these cells increases as they grow. Further experiments showed that the extension of STROMULES is regulated by the presence of actins filaments on the endoplasmic reticulum ( MT for short ), a structure that helps to support the growth of plant cells and other organelles. When the plants were treated with a drug called Cytochalasin D ( CTD ) or a gene for a protein called GCP4, they were able to increase the number of stormules and lengthen their length and length. Stromular extensions were also observed in green leaf tissue and in fruit and vegetable cells, suggesting that this is a general mechanism of innate immunodeficiency. A next step will be to find out if this same mechanism is also used in other plants."

Proteins are strings of amino acids that have folded into a specific three-dimensional shape . Proteins must have the correct shape to function properly , as they often work by binding to other proteins or molecules\u2014much like a key fitting into a lock . Working out the structure of a protein can , therefore , provide major insights into how the protein does its job . Two or more proteins can bind together and form a complex to perform various tasks; and solving the structures of these complexes can be challenging , even if the structures of the protein subunits are known . Now , Ovchinnikov , Kamisetty , and Baker have developed a method for predicting which parts of the proteins make contact with each other in a two-protein complex . Different species can have copies of the same proteins; but a copy from one species might have different amino acids at certain positions when compared to a related copy from another species . As such , when pairs of interacting proteins from different species are compared , there will be many positions in the two proteins that vary . However , if the amino acid at a position in one protein ( let's call it \u2018X\u2019 ) varies , and the amino acid at , say , position \u2018Y\u2019 in the other protein also varies such that for any given amino acid at position Y there is often a specific amino acid at position X; positions X and Y are said to \u2018co-vary\u2019 . Ovchinnikov et al . noticed that when a pair of amino acids ( one from each protein in a two-protein complex ) co-varied , these two amino acids tended to make contact with each other at the protein\u2013protein interface . Ovchinnikov et al . used the new method to make predictions about the protein\u2013protein interfaces in 28 protein complexes found in bacteria , and also to make a prediction about the interface between protein subunits in the bacterial ribosome . When these predictions were checked against the actual structures , which were all known beforehand , they were found to be accurate if the number of copies of each protein being compared is greater than the average length of the two proteins . Ovchinnikov et al . went on to predict the amino acids on the protein\u2013protein interfaces for another 36 bacterial protein complexes with unknown structures , and to present models for four larger complexes . The next challenge is to extend the method to protein complexes that are found only in eukaryotes ( i . e . , not in bacteria ) . Since the number of related copies for eukaryotic proteins tends to be smaller , there are fewer proteins to compare and it is therefore harder to detect \u2018covariation\u2019 when it occurs .",
        "first_gen": "Proteins are made up of many different amino acids, and each amino acid has its own unique sequence identity. However, it is not clear how the amino-acid sequence identities of the residues that make contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution. To answer this question, Dago et al. used a technique called a pseudo-likelihood-based statistical method to predict whether two proteins are in contact with each other. This method predicts that two protein complexes are almost always at the same position in the three-dimensional structure, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of each protein. The model then predicts whether the proteins will interact with one another, or if they will only interact if there is sufficient alignment. In the case of a protein complex, this is because the sequence of residues is more than twice as long as the protein\u2019s length. For example, if the DNA of one protein is longer than that of another protein, then it will be more likely to interact than it would be to be in direct contact. Therefore, the model could be used to build models of biological complexes."

When viewing a scene , people fixate on a sequence of locations by making fast eye movements to shift their gaze between locations . Previous studies have shown that these fixations are not random , but are actively chosen so that they depend on both the scene and the task . For example , in order to determine the gender or emotion from a face , we fixate around the eyes or the nose , respectively . Previous studies have only analyzed whether humans choose the optimal fixation locations in very simple situations , such as searching for a square among a set of circles . Therefore , it is not known how efficient we are at optimizing our rapid eye movements to extract high-level information from visual scenes , such as determining whether an image of fur belongs to a cheetah or a zebra . Yang , Lengyel and Wolpert developed a mathematical model that determines the amount of information that can be extracted from an image by any set of fixation locations . The model could also work out the next best fixation location that would maximize the amount of information that could be collected . This model shows that humans are about 70% efficient in planning each eye movement . Furthermore , it suggests that the inefficiencies are largely caused by imperfect vision and inaccurate eye movements . Yang , Lengyel and Wolpert\u2019s findings indicate that we combine information from multiple locations to direct our eye movements so that we can maximize the information we collect from our surroundings .

However, it is not clear whether the eye movements used to categorize a scene are the same as those used in visual search.

Participants were asked to identify a single visual location that had all the necessary information in it, and to select a particular location based on their eyes\u2019 movements. The task involved a series of detailed observations, including facial expressions, gestures and gestures of the people around them. This information was then combined with information gathered about the current visual scene to produce an optimal strategy for categorizing the image. In this way, the participants were able to distinguish between the images that they had seen and those that were partially obscured by foliage. These results suggest that the active strategy used by participants in this task is more efficient than visual searches, which require more information to be gathered from multiple locations. Further work is now needed to find out whether this strategy is also effective in other tasks."

Surrounding the nucleus is a protective membrane which molecules must pass across in order to reach the cell\u2019s DNA . Straddling the membrane are nuclear pore complexes , or NPCs for short , which act as the gatekeepers to the nucleus , shuttling thousands of different molecules back and forth whilst restricting access to others . Large cargoes need to have specific markers on their surface called nuclear localization signals in order to be transported by NPCs . Certain transporter proteins help the NPC carry large molecules across the membrane by binding to these signals . This generates the energy needed to overcome the barrier of transporting it across the membrane . Some viruses have nuclear localization signals of their own , which can exploit this transport system; these signals allow the virus to enter the nucleus and hijack the genetic machinery of the cell . It has been suggested that viruses have multiple copies of these surface signals to improve their chances of reaching the nucleus . However , it remained unclear how the number of nuclear localization signals affects the transport of large molecules into the nucleus . To answer this question , Paci et al . engineered a range of different sized particles derived from viral structures which had varying numbers of nuclear localization signals on their surface . These particles were inserted into human cell lines grown in the laboratory , and imaged to see how they were transported into the nucleus . The rate of nuclear transport was then measured for each particle , and this data was used to create a mathematical model . Paci et al . found that the larger the cargo , the more nuclear localization signals it needed to be efficiently transported across the membrane into the nucleus . This is because inserting big cargoes into the NPC requires more energy . Therefore , by increasing the number of surface signals transporter proteins can bind to , larger molecules are able to interact with the NPC and generate the energy required for crossing . These findings improve our current understanding of how nuclear transport could be hijacked by viruses . It could also help scientists who are developing targeted nanoparticles to deliver therapies for genetic conditions to the nucleus .",

This complex is made up of more than 2000 different proteins, two thirds of which are folded proteins that bind nuclear transport receptors ( NTRs ) to proteins. The NPC is also the gatekeeper of many other cargoes that can pass through the NPC. However, it is not clear how large a large cargo can be efficiently transported. To find out, Kosinski et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the size and structure of a small cargo that passes through NPC in a typical HeLa cell. In the experiments, the cells were exposed to a fluorescent dye, which was then used to measure the sizes of the cargo. These measurements revealed that the volume of cargo inside NPC varies between 15 nm and 30 nm, depending on the type of protein that binds to the receptor, and the amount of energy needed to transport it. Further experiments showed that a protein called FG nucleoporins ( FG Nups ) is responsible for controlling the number of NLSs on NPC, but it was not known how much of this protein was involved in the transport of large molecules. Kann, G\u00f6rlich and Szymborska used the same approach to investigate the molecular determinants of nuclear cargo transport in different types of cells. Together, these results show that nuclear cargo transport depends on a range of molecular factors, including size, number and energy cost. For example, if a molecule is large enough to travel through an NPC at the right time, then it will be able to pass into the nucleus, where it can then be used as a template for other molecules to enter the cell and transport to other parts of its nucleus. Overall, this work provides a new way to understand how cargo is transported in cells and how it affects the efficiency of cell survival."

The cells of the so-called \u2018innate immune system\u2019 are the body's first line of defense against infection , and these cells patrol the organs and tissues in an effort to locate and eliminate pathogens quickly . The innate immune response is rapid and non-specific , but often cannot completely clear an infection . When necessary , innate immune cells will escalate the immune response by activating the second branch of the immune system , called the \u2018adaptive immune system\u2019 . This specifically targets and eradicates an invading pathogen . T cells are essential components of the adaptive immune system , and these cells can be readily distinguished from other types of cell by proteins called T cell receptors ( or TCRs ) found on their surface . There are also different types of T cell , each with a specific function . T helper cells , for example , help other adaptive immune cells to mature and activate , which involves these immune cells proliferating and developing into more specialized cells . For a T cell to activate , two events must occur at the same time . First , the TCR must recognize and bind to a fragment of the pathogen that is presented to it by an innate immune cell . And second , \u2018co-stimulatory molecules\u2019 present on the surfaces of both the T cell and the same innate immune cell must interact . Using these two signals to activate a T cell helps to ensure the adaptive immune response is not \u2018unleashed\u2018 unnecessarily . Co-stimulatory molecules have become popular targets for therapies aimed at treating autoimmune disorders\u2014where the immune system attacks and destroys the body's own tissues . One of the most well studied co-stimulatory molecules expressed by T cells is called CD28; however , it remained unknown whether CD28 is involved in any processes after T cell activation . Now , Linterman et al . reveal that the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule plays a number of roles in addition to T cell activation . For example , a newly developed mouse model showed that CD28 must remain on the surface of T helper cells after they have been activated for these cells to effectively specialize . Linterman et al . also discovered that CD28 helps different T helper cell subtypes to develop . Linterman et al . demonstrate that CD28 is critical throughout a host's response to infection , and suggest that if CD28 is lost on activated T cells ( which happens during aging , HIV infection and autoimmune diseases ) the responses of T helper cells become limited .

To investigate this question, Klinger et al. created a strain of mice that lacked the gene that encodes a molecule that is needed for the activation of CD8 signaling. The mice were genetically engineered to be immune to a virus called Citrobacter rodentium, a bacterium that causes an autoimmune disease in humans and other animals. In the experiments, the mice showed that a protein called CD80/CD86 was required for activation after the virus had entered the intestines. This protein was then removed from the mouse cells, but it was not known whether this protein is also needed to maintain the immune response in response to infection, or if it has a different role to that found in other signaling molecules. Further experiments revealed that the activity of another protein, called T-lymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ), is essential for activating the cells that are responsible for controlling the growth and maintenance of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, CD86 is required to activate the cell types that help to control the spread of viruses, such as citrus fruit flies, which are resistant to viral infections.

These cells have different shapes and sizes, but it was not known how they maintained their shape at both positive and negative curvatures. To find out how this shape maintenance is maintained, the researchers used two metabolic probes to look at the surface of different cells from different species of bacteria. In the experiments, cells were genetically modified to produce two proteins called MreB and CcmA. Both proteins were found to be active at negative and positive Gaussian curvature, while the other protein was absent at positive or negative.

Two proteins in the cell have a major role in controlling mitochondrial fusion: Ubp12 and Ubp2 . Ubp12 prevents fusion , while Ubp2 activates it . These molecules carry out their roles by acting on a third protein called mitofusin , which is a key gatekeeper of the fusion mechanism . Cells often \u2018tag\u2019 proteins with small molecules called ubiquitin to change the protein\u2019s role and how it interacts with other cellular structures . Depending on how they are \u2018tagged\u2019 , mitofusins can exist in two forms . One type of tagging means that the protein then promotes fusion of the mitochondria; the other leads to the mitofusin being destroyed by the cell . It is still unclear how Ubp12 , Ubp2 and the different forms of mitofusins interact with each other to finely control mitochondrial fusion . Here , Sim\u00f5es , Schuster et al . clarify these interactions in yeast and show how these proteins are themselves regulated . Ubp2 promotes fusion by attaching to the mitofusin that is labeled to be destroyed , and removing this tag: the mitofusin will then not be degraded , and can promote fusion . Ubp12 prevents fusion through two mechanisms . First , it can remove the \u2018pro-fusion\u2019 tag on the mitofusin that prompts mitochondrial fusion . Second , Sim\u00f5es , Schuster et al . now show that Ubp12 also inhibits Ubp2 and its fusion-promoting activity . In turn , the experiments reveal that a master protein called Cdc48 can control the entire Ubp12-Ubp2-mitofusin pathway . Cdc48 directly represses Ubp12 and therefore its anti-fusion activity . This inhibition also leaves Ubp2 free to stimulate fusion through its action on mitofusin . The molecules involved in controlling mitochondrial fusion in yeast are very similar to the ones in people . In humans , improper regulation of mitofusins causes an incurable disease of the nerves and the brain called Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2A .

However, it was not known how these two DUBs work together, or how they regulate the activities of both of them. To investigate this question, Anton and Hochstrasser used a technique called coimmunoprecipitation to study the role of two enzymes that interact in a cascade of events called ubiquitylation. First, they found that the enzymes were able to bind to and cleave different proteins that were not found on the other enzymes. Second, these enzymes reduced the levels of a group of enzymes called UBP12 that was found to be ubiquitized. Finally, Ubps12 and UbP2 were unable to inhibit the formation of new proteins and instead reduced their activity. Further experiments showed that these three enzymes interact to control the activation or repression of fusion processes. Together these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control how the proteins are produced."

A part of the brain called the ventral occipito-temporal cortex ( VOTC ) helps categorize visual information . Specific parts of the VOTC prefer different types of visual input; for example , one part may tend to respond more to faces , whilst another may prefer houses . However , it is not clear how the VOTC characterizes information . One idea is that similarities between certain types of visual information may drive how information is organized in the VOTC . For example , looking at faces requires using central vision , while looking at houses requires using peripheral vision . Furthermore , all faces have a roundish shape while houses tend to have a more rectangular shape . Another possibility , however , is that the categorization of different inputs cannot be explained just by vision , and is also be driven by higher-level aspects of each category . For instance , how humans use or interact with something may also influence how an input is categorized . If categories are established depending ( at least partially ) on these higher-level aspects , rather than purely through visual likeness , it is likely that the VOTC would respond similarly to both sounds and images representing these categories . Now , Mattioni et al . have tested how individuals with and without sight respond to eight different categories of information to find out whether or not categorization is driven purely by visual likeness . Each category was presented to participants using sounds while measuring their brain activity . In addition , a group of participants who could see were also presented with the categories visually . Mattioni et al . then compared what happened in the VOTC of the three groups \u2013 sighted people presented with sounds , blind people presented with sounds , and sighted people presented with images \u2013 in response to each category . The experiment revealed that the VOTC organizes both auditory and visual information in a similar way . However , there were more similarities between the way blind people categorized auditory information and how sighted people categorized visual information than between how sighted people categorized each type of input . Mattioni et al . also found that the region of the VOTC that responds to inanimate objects massively overlapped across the three groups , whereas the part of the VOTC that responds to living things was more variable . These findings suggest that the way that the VOTC organizes information is , at least partly , independent from vision . The experiments also provide some information about how the brain reorganizes in people who are born blind .

In contrast to vision, the region that encodes sounds is organized in a way that is similar to the one seen in visual input. This reorganization occurs when the sensory input is different from the input received by the eye. For example, when a sound is presented acoustically, this region is more likely to respond to sounds than to images presented visually.

For example , certain fungi can hijack the nervous systems of ants , turning them into \u2018zombies\u2019 that are forced to climb to the precise height of a plant with the right conditions for the fungus to grow . Another fungus , called Entomophthora muscae , induces a similar behavior in flies . Like with the ants , this fungus forces the flies to climb to a high location and to attach themselves to the plant with their mouthparts , so providing a basis for the fungus to grow . Due to the lack of knowledge and tools that allow us to study the genes and cells of many of these host species , it remains unclear how these microbes can manipulate other animals and change their behavior .

The fruit flies were infected with E . muscae obtained from the wild and activity patterns in the genes of both organisms were tracked . One day after infection with the fungus , the flies developed a strong immune response to the invader , and many genes involved in the immune system were overactive . After two days , the fungus started to adopt the shape that eventually kills the flies and began to invade the nervous system . By the third day , the fungus had spread throughout the body and most flies died around four to five days following infection . Two to three hours after the flies had died , the digestive and reproductive systems had been consumed by the fungus and the nervous system was in the process of being degraded .

        "first_gen": "Many of the most extraordinary examples of evolution have been found in animals. For example, a fungus called Entomophthora muscae infects the skin of an infected fly. This fungus is able to cause the fly\u2019s skin to become inflamed, and then, when it is ready to die, it attaches its mandibles to the body cavity and devours it. The fungus can also infect other insects, such as the house fly, which can be used as a model organism to study the behavior of its host. Previous studies have shown that the fungus invades the nervous system of insects that are infected with the disease. However, this is not the case in the laboratory. Instead, researchers have used a technique called microscopy to examine the effects of this fungus on flies that had recently been infected by an insect called Drosophila melanogaster. In the experiments, the flies were exposed to a new fungus that was infecting them, but it was not clear how it did this. Now, Steinkraus et al. have identified a strain of a fungal pathogen that can infect a fly that has recently died from an infection with a parasitic fungus in a laboratory species. These flies have a distinctive \u2018zombie ant fungus' that causes them to crawl upward, extend their proboscides, then raise their wings and fly away from their host, whereupon they fly to their final resting place and die. Further experiments showed that this behavior-changing fungus could be exploited by other fungi, including the entomopathogenic fungi that parasitize house flies."

As such , regulating the quantities of different RNAs is a key part of how cells survive , grow , adapt and respond to changes . For example , messenger RNAs ( or mRNAs for short ) carry genetic information from DNA which the cell reads to produce proteins . RNAs that are not needed can be degraded and removed from the cell by RNA degradation proteins . Most RNA degradation proteins need to be able to bind to RNA in order to work . A technique called \u201cphotoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation\u201d , often shortened to PAR-CLIP , can detect these proteins on their targets . The PAR-CLIP technique irreversibly links RNA-binding proteins to RNA and then collects those proteins and their bound RNAs for analysis . As with DNA , the RNAs can be identified using genetic sequencing . Degradation often starts at RNA ends , where specialized structures protect the RNA from accidental damage . Using PAR-CLIP , Sohrabi-Jahromi , Hofmann et al performed a detailed study of 30 RNA degradation proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The results highlight the specialization of different proteins to different groups of RNAs . One group of proteins , for example , remove the protective \u2018cap\u2019 structure at the start of RNAs .

        "first_gen": "RNA is made up of a protein called messenger RNA ( mRNAs ), which is found in the nucleus of the cell. When messenger RNAs are produced, they are rapidly degraded to make proteins that can be made into RNA molecules. However, it is not clear how these processes are regulated. To understand how RNA is degraded, Schmid et al. studied the activity of 30 different RNA degradation factors in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The experiments show that the enzymes responsible for the degradation of mRNA are involved in a number of different processes. For example, a group of enzymes called Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4 bind to mRNA molecules that are defective in translation. These enzymes are then recruited to the mRNA molecule by a process known as \u2018transcriptome mapping\u2019. In yeast, the RNA molecule is broken down into a series of three-dimensional structures called the \u201cpoly-adenylated\u201d tail. This process is known to be triggered by the loss of one of these proteins, called Pab1, and is followed by another protein that is needed to break down the polymerase that encodes the protein. It is also known that a complex of other enzymes that control the production of RNA can also be used to degrade mRNA, but it was not known how this process works. Now, Schroeder et. have used a technique called photactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation ( PAR-CLIP for short ) to identify 30 specific RNA-degenerating factors that were recruited only for mRNA degradation. Together, these profiles reveal that these enzymes target a wide range of types of nuclear RNA, including nuclear and non-nuclear RNA. Further work is now required to find out how the nuclear surveillance machinery targets these nuclear types."

For instance , species in the crucifer family \u2013 which includes mustard , cabbages and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana \u2013 can defend themselves with camalexin , a compound produced soon after the plant receives signals from its attacker . What controls this precise timing , however , is still unclear . For the genes that rule the production of camalexin to be \u2018read\u2019 , interpreted , and ultimately converted into proteins , their DNA sequences first need to be physically accessible to the cell . This availability is controlled , in part , by adding or removing chemical groups onto histones , the spool-like structures which DNA wraps around . These precisely controlled modifications ultimately help to activate or repress a gene . Sometimes , activating and inhibiting chemical groups can be present in the same location , creating what is known as a bivalent chromatin domain . Zhao et al . investigated whether histone modifications regulate when A . thaliana produces camalexin in response to an attack . A combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches highlighted two chemical modifications ( one repressive , the other activating ) which were present on the same histone , forming a previously unknown bivalent chromatin domain . Mutant plants which did not carry these modifications could not produce camalexin at the right time . Further experiments showed that under normal conditions , both histone modifications were present . However , when the plant was under attack , the level of repressive and activating modifications respectively decreased and increased , leading to gene activation . Together , the results by Zhao et al . suggest that both histone modifications are required for camalexin genes to respond appropriately to signals from a harmful agent . A deeper understanding of this new mechanism could , in turn , allow scientists to engineer crops that are better at resisting disease .",
        "first_gen": "Genes are essential for many processes in plants and animals. For example, when a gene is expressed in a plant, it can trigger a process called gene induction. This process involves changing the expression of genes in the plant\u2019s genes, which can be rapidly induced by various biotic and abiotic stimuli. In plants, this process is controlled by a group of enzymes called transcription factors. One of these enzymes, called chromatin remodeler pickle, is involved in regulating the activity of the genes that control gene expression. However, the exact role of this enzyme is not well understood. It is thought that it plays an important role in controlling the timing of gene activation, but it was not clear how it works. Now, Xu et al. have used a combination of genetic and epigenomic data to investigate the roles of two epigenetic marks in Arabidopsis thaliana. The experiments show that the two marks play opposite roles on gene activity, and that they are linked to the production of a protein complex called H3K27me3, a type of bivalent chromatin. Further experiments also showed that two different types of modifications were required to enable the activation of both genes at the same time. Importantly, these two modifications had the opposite effect on the levels of histone 3, another transcription factor that is required for the gene to be activated. These findings suggest that both modifications are necessary to allow the release of certain genes into the cell. Xu and Xu also found that a second epigenome modification, known as kairostat, was needed to ensure that these genes were activated at a specific time and place. Together these findings provide a new set of insights into how genes are regulated in plant cells."

However , it was not clear how these neurogenic astrocytes were different from other astrocytes . Now Hwang et al . have found that neurogenic astrocytes contain a protein called EZH2 that is not found in other types of astrocyte in the adult brain . Researchers already knew that this protein , which acts to help keep DNA tightly packed inside the nucleus and to keep genes switched off , was important for brain development . EZH2 was also known to prevent stem cells from prematurely turning into specialized cell types . But , surprisingly , Hwang et al . found that EZH2 has two distinct roles in neurogenic astrocytes: it allows them to multiply to make more astrocytes , and it also helps guide astrocytes into becoming neurons .

Now, Aloia et al. show that a protein called EZH2 regulates the activity of several transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes associated with non-SVZ cells. This protein is found in a group of proteins called Polycomb group proteins, which are involved in regulating the production of other proteins. The experiments showed that this protein binds to a transcription factor called a histone methyltransferase ( PRC2 ) that is required for the formation of new neurons. Further experiments revealed that the gene that encodes this gene is also present in other cells in this region.

Although a lack of oxygen is sometimes considered detrimental to living organisms , oxygen minimum zones appear to be rich with microbial life that is adapted to thrive under oxygen-starved conditions . Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria are one of the most abundant groups of microbes in these oxygen minimum zones , and several of these bacteria are known to influence the recycling of chemical substances . Now , Roux et al . introduce a new method to identify viruses that infect the microbes in this environment , including those microbes that cannot be grown in the laboratory and which have previously remained largely unexplored . The genomes of 127 individual bacterial cells \u2014collected from an oxygen minimum zone in western Canada\u2014 were examined . Roux et al . estimate that about a third of the sulfur-oxidizing bacterial cells are infected by at least one virus , but often multiple viruses infected the same bacterium . Five new genera ( groups of one or more species ) of viruses were also discovered and found to infect these bacteria . Looking for these new viral sequences in the DNA of this oxygen minimum zone's microbial community revealed that these newly discovered viruses persist in this region over several years . It also revealed that these viruses appear to only be found within the oxygen minimum zone . Roux et al . uncovered that these viruses carry genes that could manipulate how an infected bacterium processes sulfur-containing compounds; this is similar to previous observations showing that other viruses also influence cellular process ( such as photosynthesis ) in infected bacteria . As such , these newly discovered viruses might also influence the recycling of chemical elements within oxygen minimum zones . Together , Roux et al .

To address this question, researchers have used a technique called metagenomic and single-cell genomic sequencing to identify 69 viruses and bacteria living in a marine oxygen minimum zone ( OMZ ). The genomes of these viruses were sequenced from uncultivated bacteria, but it was not known how the viruses interacted with the bacteria. Now, Hurwitz, Anantharaman et al. have now used this technique to examine the microbial communities in an ocean environment that has been exposed to high levels of oxygen and high concentrations of sulfite. This revealed that SUP05 bacteria are more likely to be infected by viruses than viruses. In addition, the microbes were also more active in oxygen-deficient waters, which suggests that they may be able to reprogram their host's energy metabolism. These findings suggest that, in addition to their ability to control oxygen levels, these bacteria also have a role to play in regulating the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Further work is now needed to find out if these two groups of viruses are related to each other."

In addition to sweeping dust and debris out of our lungs and airways , cilia have a number of other crucial roles during development . This means that faulty cilia can lead to serious birth defects , as well as diseases of the kidneys and respiratory system . Cilia and flagella are made from proteins that are assembled in a process called intraflagellar transport or IFT for short . Around 20 proteins are thought to be involved in this process , but the precise role of many of these proteins remains unclear . Now Ishikawa et al . have compared the versions of one of these proteins , called TTC26 , that are found in zebrafish , mouse cells , and a single-celled alga called Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that uses a pair of flagella to move around . This protein localizes to the cilia of mice cells and can be seen to move along these cilia in a manner typical of other IFT proteins . Ishikawa et al . then blocked production of TTC26 in zebrafish embryos , which caused these embryos to fail to develop the correct left\u2013right asymmetry , and these fish also had problems with their eyes , ears , and kidneys . Furthermore and although cilia were present in the affected zebrafish , these cilia were shortened and moved abnormally . Ishikawa et al . also found that algae that had a mutation in the gene that codes for TTC26 had short cilia that moved in an abnormal way . The findings of Ishikawa et al . suggest that TTC26 may help to transport a specific subset of proteins into the cilia .

For example, a protein called TTC26/DYF13 is found in zebrafish embryos and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which are both single-celled eukaryotes and humans. This protein is a member of a group of 20 proteins and motor proteins called IFT complex B proteins. These proteins can be separated biochemically and functionally into two subcomplexes, called TFT complexes A and B. To investigate the role of this complex, Ishikawa et al. used a technique called electron microscopy to look at the activity of two proteins that interact with each other. The experiments showed that the TTF complexes B and C were able to move along the length of C, whereas the TTC complexes C and D were unable to do so. Further experiments also revealed that a particular set of other proteins were not required for the transport of cargo proteins along C.. In addition, the protein was found to be depleted in mutant mice that had abnormal motility and abnormal ear otolith formation, similar to those seen in human ciliopathies. Overall, these findings support the idea that many different proteins play different roles in a complex. Future studies are also needed to understand how the complex proteins work together to assemble and maintain these complex structures in different organisms."

When a crystal cell is released, this cell divides to form a new cell type called plasmmatocyte, which is a type of cell that can differentiate into a cell from a different type. Further experiments revealed that this process occurs in clusters of crystals that form at the end of each stage of development and is dependent on the integrity of these structures.

The experiments show that yeast strain YPS1009, a strain of yeast that produces two, three, or four copies of a gene, is more sensitive to the effects on the gene than laboratory strains. This is because the yeast is extremely slow growing, regardless of how many copies it has of its genetic material. In contrast, laboratory yeast are able to grow in a way that allows them to tolerate the increased expression of many genes that are toxic when they are overexpressed. Here, Sheltzer et al. used a technique called RNA deep sequencing to analyze the genomes of six different strains of wild yeast. These strains were genetically engineered to produce a small number of different genes, but the experiments showed that some of these genes were more active than expected. Further experiments revealed that these strains had higher levels of gene-dosage compensation at 10\u201330% of amplified genes compared to wild strains, suggesting that this is a natural, if transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution."

        "ground_truth": "Eyes are elaborate organs that many animals use to detect light and see , but light can also be sensed in other , simpler ways and for purposes other than seeing . All animals that perceive light rely on cells called photoreceptors , which come in two main types: ciliary or rhabdomeric . Sometimes , an organism has both types of photoreceptors , but one is typically more important than the other . For example , most vertebrates see using ciliary photoreceptors , while rhabdomeric photoreceptors underpin vision in invertebrates . Flatworms are invertebrates that have long been studied due to their ability to regenerate following injuries . These worms have rhabdomeric photoreceptors in their eyes , but they also have unusual cells outside their eyes that have cilia \u2013 slender protuberances from the cell body - and could potentially be light sensitive . One obvious way to test if a cell is a photoreceptor is to see if it produces any light-sensing proteins , such as opsins . Until recently it was thought that each type of photoreceptor produced a different opsin , which were therefore classified into rhabdomeric of ciliary opsins . However , recent work has identified a new type of opsin , called xenopsin , in the ciliary photoreceptors of the larvae of some marine invertebrates . To determine whether the cells outside the flatworm\u2019s eye were ciliary photoreceptors , Rawlinson et al . examined the genetic code of 30 flatworm species looking for ciliary opsin and xenopsin genes . This search revealed that all the flatworm species studied contained the genetic sequence for xenopsin , but not for the ciliary opsin . Rawlinson et al . chose the tiger flatworm to perform further experiments . First , they showed that , in this species , xenopsin genes are active both in the eyes of larvae and in the unusual ciliary cells found outside the eyes of the adult . Next , they put the xenopsin from the tiger flatworm into human embryonic kidney cells , and found that when the protein is present these cells can respond to light . This demonstrates that the newly discovered xenopsin is light-sensitive , suggesting that the unusual ciliary cells found expressing this protein outside the eyes in flatworms are likely photoreceptive cells . It is unclear why flatworms have developed these unusual ciliary photoreceptor cells or what their purpose is outside the eye . Often , photoreceptor cells outside the eyes are used to align the \u2018body clock\u2019 with the day-night cycle . This can be a factor in healing , hinting perhaps that these newly found cells may have a role in flatworms\u2019 ability to regenerate .",
        "first_gen": "Flatworms are one of the most diverse groups of invertebrates in the world. Their eyes are a key biological stimulus for most animals, and they are able to detect light using photopigments. However, it is not clear how these photoreceptors evolved. One type of opsin, called ciliary opsins, is thought to be involved in phototransduction, but little is known about the role of these cells. Xenopsin is a protein that is found in many different types of cells, including the eyespot and extraocular cells that surround the brain. It is also thought that this protein may have evolved in a different group of animals. Now, V\u00f6cking et al. have discovered that xenopsins are present in two different subfamilies of flatworms, the larva and the adult. These cells are made up of cilia and microvilli, while the adults use a similar cell type called the epidermal vacuole. The larvae of Maritigrella crozieri, a flatworm species that has been studied for over a decade, show that they have two distinct subtypes: the cile-ciliated cells of their eyes and a phaosome that surrounds their brains. In addition, they also have a second subtype called rhabdomeric cells in which they interact with other cells to form a photoplasmic retinaldehyde. Together, these findings suggest that these two subgroups are similar to each other. Further work is now needed to understand how this sub-type evolved and how it has evolved over time."

The process depends on two types of information: signals separated across space and time . Spatial cues tell a stem cell what type of cell it is going to be , while temporal cues work as molecular clocks to generate a sequence of different neurons over time . Together , these cues generate the large array of cell types in the nervous system . Each stem cell occupies its own space in the developing body and receives its own spatial cues , but they all follow the same timeline . For example , proteins called transcription factors act as molecular clocks and interact with specific genes , telling the cell when to turn them on or off . The same series of transcription factors operates in different stem cells , but they have different effects . So far , it has been unclear whether spatial and temporal signals work independently or sequentially to generate new cell types . To find out , Sen et al . studied two distinct , developing stem cells in fruit flies , which receive different spatial signals . Transcription factors only work if they are able to get to their target genes . Cells can open or close access to different genes by changing the structure of the chromatin wrapping that surrounds the genes . In the experiments , a marker was used to reveal the areas of open chromatin in each of the cells . Another marker was used to track the transcription factors . The results showed that the areas of open chromatin varied between stem cells . Moreover , although both cells used the same transcription factor called Hunchback , it targeted different genes in each stem cell . This was due to changes in the chromatin wrapping: Hunchback only acted in areas where the chromatin was open . This suggests that the spatial cues first sculpt the chromatin , making some genes easier to get to than others . Then , the same transcription factors go to the accessible gene , which will differ from one stem cell to another . These findings help us to understand how different types of brain cells develop , which may also aid us in finding a way how to engineer specific cell types . If we could turn stem cells into different types of brain cells , it might help us to treat brain diseases . This may involve giving the right spatial signal before starting the temporal cues .",
        "first_gen": "The nervous system is made up of a network of neurons called the neuroectoderm. Each neuroblast produces a sequence of 30 neurons in each segment, named according to their row and columnar position. These neurons and glia are then called progenitor neurons, which are produced in the brain and the optic lobes. However, it is not clear how the spatial and temporal cues are integrated to specify the neuronal identity of each neuron. To investigate this, Kohwi et al. used a technique called Targeted DamID to measure the activity of two proteins called Hunchback and Pax3. Both proteins are involved in a process called spatial patterning, where they bind to specific regions of the DNA to produce different types of cells. The experiments show that the first step in this process is to identify the regions that are important for the formation of new neurons. In mammals and Drosophila, the two-dimensional neuroblasts produce 30 different cells, each with a unique pattern of genes and proteins. But it was not known how spatial factors and TTFs work together to determine the neural identities produced by each of these cells and how they are linked to each other. This is particularly important in mammals, because they have a wide range of brain regions, including the eyes, ears and eyes. It is also important to understand the role of temporal factors, as well as spatial patterns, in determining the identity produced during the developmental stages of neural development."

Members of the P2X family of receptors are ion channels that form pores through the membrane . When a molecule of ATP binds to the external region of the receptor , it activates it and causes the receptor to change from a closed to an open shape . Once opened , ions flow through the channel\u2019s pore and trigger a response inside the cell . P2X receptors are found on most animal cells ( including nerve cells ) and are involved in both normal cellular activity and processes linked to disease , including inflammation and chronic pain . The P2X receptor has three parts or subunits , and each contributes to the channel\u2019s pore . Recent research using a technique called X-ray crystallography has revealed how ATP binding causes shape changes in the external region of the receptor . But these three-dimensional structures did not reveal details of how the subunits move to open or close the channel\u2019s pore . Habermacher et al . have now added light-sensitive linkers onto the P2X receptor in a way that meant that different colors of light could be used to force parts of the receptor to come closer together or move apart . This allowed the pore to be opened and closed in response to changes in light . Habermacher et al . then studied the behavior of these modified receptors within a natural membrane and found that the light stimulated movements were similar to those seen with ATP . When the behavior of the receptor and light-sensitive linkers was studied using computer simulations , it led to new models of the P2X pore in the open and closed state . In these models , the open channel was more tightly packed than in the previous structure and an unexpected hinge-bending movement was seen to accompany the opening of the channel . It is hoped that this new approach will also be useful for probing how other membrane proteins change their shape when activated .",
        "first_gen": "P2X receptors are a family of proteins that are found in many types of cells, including neurons and neurons. These receptors switch rapidly between closed and open conformations in response to the release of ions from the cell\u2019s surface. When the receptor is activated, it opens a compartment in the membrane called the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) that is responsible for controlling the movement of the ions. However, the exact details of how the receptors open and close are not fully understood. Now, Hattori, Gouaux et al. have used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the structure of a protein called P2x2 receptor in a zebrafish cell. The experiments revealed that the inside and outer ends of two proteins, called TM1 and TM2, are tightly packed together to form a pore-lining structure. This structure is thought to control the flow of sodium, potassium and calcium ions through the channel, but it is not clear how this mechanism works. To address this question, they used microscopy and computational techniques to observe a series of \u201cmolecular tweezers\u201d that could be used to manipulate the shape of this membrane-embedded receptor. In the experiments, these microscopes were able to precisely measure the distance between the outer and inner end of each protein, which allowed them to accurately model the opening motion of an ATP-gated receptor during activation. Further experiments showed that this distance was significantly reduced compared to that seen in other membrane proteins. Taken together these findings provide new insights into the gating mechanism of P1X2 receptors, and may open new therapeutic avenues."

        "ground_truth": "The successful division of one cell into two is essential for all organisms to live , grow and reproduce . For an animal cell , the nucleus \u2013 the compartment containing the genetic material \u2013 must divide before the surrounding material . The rest of the cell , called the cytoplasm , physically separates later in a process known as cytokinesis . Cytokinesis in animal cells is driven by the formation of a ring in the middle of the dividing cell . The ring is composed of myosin motor proteins and filaments made of a protein called actin . The movements of the motor proteins along the filaments cause the ring to contract and tighten . This pulls the cell membrane inward and physically pinches the cell into two . For a long time , the mechanism of cytokinesis was assumed to be same across different types of animal cell , but later evidence suggested otherwise . For example , in liver , heat and bone cells , cytokinesis naturally fails during development to create cells with two or more nuclei . If a similar \u2018failure\u2019 happened in other cell types , it could lead to diseases such as cancers or blood disorders . This raised the question: what are the molecular mechanisms that allow cytokinesis to happen differently in different cell types ? Davies et al . investigated this question using embryos of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans at a stage in their development when they consist of just four cells . The proteins forming the contractile ring in this worm are the same as those in humans . However , in the worm , the contractile ring can easily be damaged using chemical inhibitors or by mutating the genes that encode its proteins . Davies et al . show that when the contractile ring was damaged , two of the four cells in the worm embryo still divided successfully . This result indicates the existence of new mechanisms to divide the cytoplasm that allow division even with a weak contractile ring . In a further experiment , the embryos were dissected to isolate each of the four cells . Davies et al . saw that one of the two dividing cells could still divide on its own , while the other cell could not . This shows that this new method of cytokinesis is regulated both by factors inherent to the dividing cell and by external signals from other cells . Moreover , one of these extrinsic signals was found to be a signaling protein that had previously been implicated in human cancers . Future work will determine if these variations in cytokinesis between the different cell types found in the worm apply to humans too; and , more importantly from a therapeutic standpoint , if these new mechanisms exist in human cancers .",

These proteins are essential for cell division, but it is not clear how they are regulated in all animal cells. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of cell called the blastomere, each cell in the embryo has a distinct cell fate. However, it has long been assumed that all cells in an animal cell divide by a similar molecular mechanism. Now, Davies et al. have used a technique called fast-acting temperature-sensitive microscopy to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie this variation. The experiments showed that the two cell types that divide in a particular way\u2014called \u201ccell-intrinsic regulation\u201d\u2014have different roles in different cell-types. For example, in two cells ( EMS and P2 ), the cytokinetic regulation is regulated by genes that regulate the activity of a protein called filamentous actin. Further experiments revealed that when cells divide, they need to be able to bind to each other in order to form a contractile ring. Furthermore, when a cell divides, this cell is unable to attach to its neighbor cell, and it cannot bind with its partner cell. Together, these findings suggest that both cell type-specific and cell identity regulation are important for the development of other tissues and organs."

Many bacteria\u2014including some important human pathogens\u2014have tails called flagella that rotate to move the bacteria inside its host . However , the immune system can detect parts of these flagella and eliminate the pathogen . Bacterial flagella are made from filaments of proteins , and some flagella are also enclosed by a sheath that is similar to the outer membrane that encloses certain bacteria . The function of this sheath is unclear , although some researchers have suggested that it might prevent the immune system from detecting the proteins in the flagellum . Now , by studying the interactions between the Hawaiian bobtail squid and a marine bacterium , Brennan et al . show that the sheath can actually alert the host that the bacteria are around . The Hawaiian bobtail squid collects bioluminescent bacteria within a so-called \u2018light organ\u2019 . This organ undergoes a number of developmental changes to house the bacteria , and the squid then uses the light from the bacteria to mask its own shadow , which helps it to avoid being detected by predators . Brennan et al . compared how wild-type bacteria and mutant bacteria that either had no flagella , or had flagella that did not rotate , interacted with young squid . Only bacteria with working flagella were able to trigger the normal development of the squid\u2019s light organ , which suggests that the rotating flagella are releasing the signal that tells the squid that the beneficial bacteria are present . Brennan et al . demonstrated that the rotation of sheathed flagella led to the release of a molecule called lipopolysaccharide . This molecule is known to activate the immune system in animals , and it is one of the bacterial signals that the squid responds to . Moreover , when the flagella of other bacteria with sheaths\u2014such as those that cause cholera\u2014are rotating , there is also an increase in the release of lipopolysaccharide . However , rotation of the flagella of bacteria without sheaths has no such effect . The next challenge will be to test the importance of this release of lipopolysaccharide from rotating flagella on the outcome of bacterial diseases of humans and other animals .",

These bacteria are able to evade the host\u2019s immune system by migrating through pores and down ducts, where they interact with other bacteria. However, it has been difficult to separate the role of the sheath from its other roles. For example, some bacteria can evade immune responses, such as the presence of a molecule called lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), which helps to activate the immune response. In the case of bacteria, this molecule is found on the surface of some of these bacterial cells, but it is not clear how it works. To investigate this question, Graf et al. used a model squid species called Vibrio fischeri to study how the bacteria migrate into the light-emitting organs of certain fishes and squids. The experiments show that the bacterial population moves through the air in a rapidly spinning structure that surrounds the cell membrane. Further experiments showed that this mechanism is activated by a bacterium that is known to be in contact with the fluid-like structure. This suggests that, in addition to helping to protect the squid from the microbes that live in its environment, the microorganisms also help to promote the spread of an immunogen that can bind to the lipid-A component of lPS. Future work will investigate whether this is the same mechanism that allows bacteria to invade the cells of other animals, including humans and squid."

In plants and animals , DNA is arranged into structures called chromosomes . Generally , an individual's genome contains two copies of each chromosome; one inherited from their mother and one from their father . However , occasionally during reproduction , all the chromosomes from one of the parents are left out from the cells of the offspring in a process called \u2018genome elimination\u2019 . This makes individuals that carry only half the normal number of chromosomes , known as haploids . Sometimes the process of genome elimination is disrupted , which leads to individuals that have incomplete genomes or chromosomes that carry big rearrangements of the DNA , as if they had been shattered and put back together incorrectly . In a small plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana , genome elimination frequently happens in the offspring of two individuals that carry different versions of a gene called centromeric histone H3 ( CENH3 ) . However , it is not clear how this works , or what roles genome elimination plays in evolution and disease . Here , Tan et al . studied genome elimination by cross-breeding Arabidopsis plants that carried a mutant form of CENH3 with plants that have a normal version of the protein . The experiments found that many of the offspring were haploid . Some of the others carried an extra copy of an entire chromosome or a section of a chromosome . A third group had an extra copy of a chromosome that was missing some sections or had been rearranged . These \u2018shattered\u2019 chromosomes were always formed from chromosomes that came from the parent plant with a mutant form of CENH3 . Tan et al . also found that a protein called DNA Ligase 4 , which helps reconnect broken DNA strands , is involved in repairing the breaks in these shattered chromosomes . Some of the genetic rearrangements documented in the experiments were passed on to subsequent generations of plants , which suggests that these genomic changes can be stable enough to be inherited . The genomic rearrangements observed in the Arabidopsis plants are similar to those seen in patients with cancer and other genetic diseases .

However, it was not clear how the mutation caused the mutations. Ravi, Chan et al. have now used a technique called genome elimination to study the effects of genetic instability on the genomes of different plants. The experiments show that a mutation in the gene that encodes the H3 gene causes the chromosome to become aneuploid. In addition, mutations in another gene, called non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ), cause the chromosomes to detach from each other. Further experiments showed that this process can be carried out in wild-type plants that have different versions of this gene. These findings provide a new system to investigate the origins, causes and consequences of genome instability.

However , under certain conditions the latent viruses can cause cancers to develop; in fact , it is estimated that such infections are responsible for nearly 2% of all cancer deaths worldwide . One way that healthy human cells prevent cancer is by triggering their own death in a process called apoptosis . The Epstein-Barr virus can block apoptosis , therefore making the cells more likely to become cancerous . Previous research identified one protein in the Epstein-Barr virus that promotes cancer by preventing infected cells from dying as normal . However , even in the absence of this protein , Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells remain resistant to apoptosis . This suggests that the virus has another way of blocking cell death . Price et al . have now used a technique that stresses living cells in a way that reveals which proteins prevent apoptosis to study human cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus . This revealed that soon after infection , the virus could force the human cell to produce MCL-1 , a protein that prevents cell death . Later , the Epstein-Barr virus enlisted a second human protein called BFL-1 , which makes the infected cell further resistant to apoptosis . Price et al . discovered that a protein in the Epstein-Barr virus called EBNA3A controls the production of the MCL-1 and BFL-1 proteins .

They found that, early on in infection of infected and early-infected cells, there was little or no expression of this gene. Further experiments showed that this change in survival is unique to infected or early in-infected B-cell lymphomas, suggesting that it may be important to develop new drugs that inhibit the production of these genes.

A group of proteins called caspases play a key role in this cell death process . Chemotherapy and radiotherapy work as cancer treatments because they damage dividing cancer cells to such an extent that caspases are turned on and kill those cells . Unfortunately the tumor occasionally grows back after the treatment , partly because caspases also help to produce signals that boost the growth of any surviving cancer cells . P\u00e9rez , Lindblad and Bergmann have now used the fruit fly Drosophila to investigate how caspases encourage tumor cells to grow and spread .

Instead , the caspases redirect their activity and help cancer cells to produce small chemicals called reactive oxygen species . These chemicals can play many different roles in cancers , but in this setting they attract immune cells to the site of the tumor . The immune cells in turn send other signals back to the cancer cells , which further activate the caspases .

However, it has not been clear how these mechanisms work under certain conditions. For example, a protein called RasV12, which encodes a molecule called JNK, has been shown to promote the proliferation of tumour-like cells, but it was not known how it does this. Now, Fogarty et al. have shown that in a mouse model of the disease called Drosophila melanogaster, the activity of two proteins called Eiger ( the enzyme that produces the gene that codes for this protein ) is switched on and off. In the mutant mice, this switch is triggered by the production of a chemical called reactive oxygen species ( or ROS for short ). These ROS are then released back to the tumor-promoting cells via a feedback loop that promotes the formation of new tumor cells. Further experiments showed that this feedback amplification loop is necessary for cancer cells to grow and proliferate.

This perception depends in part on the sensory properties of the stimuli we are experiencing . Intense stimuli , such as bright and fast-moving objects , trigger stronger responses in the brain than less intense stimuli , and so we perceive them as longer lasting . But what role do we , as the experiencers , play in how we perceive time ? To find out , Liu , Yuan , Chen et al . showed volunteers pairs of movie clips , each featuring two human figures outlined by dots . In one clip , the two figures interacted socially , for example by passing an object between them . In the other , the two figures moved independently of each other . The volunteers had to decide which clip lasted longer . The volunteers generally judged clips containing social interactions to be shorter than those without such interactions , even when this was not the case . Moreover , volunteers with better social skills tended to underestimate the length of the social interaction clips to a greater extent . Previous studies have shown that people who are more social tend to have higher levels of a hormone called oxytocin in their blood . Oxytocin is sometimes referred to as the \u2018love hormone\u2019 because it promotes social behavior and bonding . Applying an oxytocin nasal spray to the volunteers who were less socially proficient caused them to perceive the social interaction clips as shorter than before . By contrast , socially proficient volunteers who used a nasal spray that blocks the effects of oxytocin perceived these clips as longer than they had done previously ( although they still judged the clips to be shorter than videos that did not show people interacting ) . The perception of time thus varies between people and may depend at least in part on personality . These results open up a new avenue for studying and manipulating how we process social situations . This could eventually benefit people who struggle with social interactions , such as those with autism spectrum disorders .",
        "first_gen": "Social interaction is one of the most important forms of communication in the world. People with autism, for example, often use body gestures to communicate with one another. However, it is not clear what role these gestures play in our perception of social interactions. To address this question, Parker et al. studied the brain activity of two people who have autism. The experiments show that when the two individuals interact with each other, they are perceived to be longer in duration than when they interact noncommunicatively. This suggests that the difference between perceived time and physical time may be due to differences in one\u2019s ability to perceive social interaction. In addition, the experiments also showed that a drug called oxytocin helps to reduce the amount of time that is spent on social communication. These findings suggest that this drug may play an important role in reducing the duration of physical communication, and may also help to explain why autism is so different from other disorders."

        "ground_truth": "As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed , new variants of the virus SARS-CoV-2 have emerged that are more infectious than the original form . The variants known as Alpha , Beta and Gamma have mutations in a protein on the virus\u2019s surface that is vital for attaching to cells and infecting them . This protein , called Spike , carries out its role by binding to ACE2 , a protein on the surface of human cells . Mutations on Spike are found on the region where it binds to ACE2 . The interaction between these two proteins appears to be important to the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 , but the impact of individual mutations in Spike is unknown . In addition , some people have different variants of ACE2 with mutations in the region that interacts with Spike , but it is not known whether this affects these people\u2019s risk of contracting COVID-19 . To answer these questions , Barton et al . measured the precise effect of mutations in Spike and ACE2 on the strength of the interaction between the two proteins . The experiments showed that three of the five common Spike mutations in the Alpha , Beta and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants strengthened binding to ACE2 . The two mutations that weakened binding were only found together with other mutations that strengthened binding . This meant that the Spike proteins in all three of these SARS-CoV-2 variants bind to ACE2 more strongly than the original form . The experiments also showed that two common variants of ACE2 also increased the strength of binding to Spike . Interestingly , one of these ACE2 variants reversed the effect of a specific SARS-CoV-2 mutation , suggesting that carriers would be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 variants with this mutation . Identifying the precise effects of Spike mutations on ACE2 binding helps understand why new variants of SARS-CoV-2 spread more rapidly . This could help to identify concerning new variants before they spread widely and inform the response by health authorities . The finding that two common ACE2 variants bind more strongly to Spike suggests that people with these mutations could be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 .",
        "first_gen": "The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infects cells and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( COVID-19 ) in more than 135 million people worldwide. This is caused by a protein called the Spike protein receptor binding domain ( RBD ), which binds to the ACE2 protein on the surface of the cell surface. Previous vaccines have prevented the virus from infecting cells, but new viruses have emerged that are able to infect cells. In 2019, a new type of virus was identified in the United States, and it is now known that it can infect human cells in a way that makes it more difficult to control the spread of this virus. However, it was not clear how this new virus interacts with other viruses. Now, Dejnirattisai et al. have used a technique called surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) to study the effects of five common mutations that affect the binding site of Spike proteins. The experiments show that these mutations enhance the interaction between the SP spike and the enzyme that codes for the protein. Further experiments showed that the mutations increase the affinity between Spike and ACE 2, while the other two mutations decrease binding. These findings are consistent with the findings of previous studies that have shown that mutations in other proteins enhance binding and facilitate immune evasion."

Although some traits are controlled by the activity of a single gene , most traits are influenced by the activities of multiple genes . The genes that influence a particular trait may work independently of each other . However , it is also possible for the genes to interact so that one gene may mask or amplify the effect of another gene . Although gene interactions were first described almost 100 years ago , it has been difficult to identify them and work out the direction of these interactions ( i . e . , does gene A affect gene B , or vice versa ? ) . Fischer , Sandmann et al . have now studied the interactions between the genes involved in 21 different traits of fruit fly cells . A technique called RNA interference was used to lower the expression of the genes in different combinations , which made it possible to analyze any changes in the traits that occurred when particular genes were not working properly . Fischer , Sandmann et al . took hundreds of thousands images of the cells and analyzed the changes in cell shape , cell size , cell division and other traits . Next , they developed a method to infer the directions of the interactions between individual pairs of genes from the data and then made a map of the genetic interactions for the traits . This map was able to reconstruct the known order of activity of genes during cell division and other cell processes . Furthermore , it revealed previously unknown interactions between genes . For example , genes involved in the Ras signaling pathway\u2014which promotes cell growth and is frequently mutated in human tumors\u2014interacted with genes that encode a group of proteins called the SWI/SNF complex . This complex alters how DNA is packaged in cells to control the expression of genes , and these gene interactions may play an important role in the control of cell growth by Ras signaling . The approach developed by Fischer , Sandmann et al . can shed light on the interactions between genes that produce complex traits of cells . In future , this approach might be helpful to find out which genetic differences between individuals alter the effectiveness of drug treatments , and the impact of using combinations of drugs to treat diseases .",

Genes also play important roles in regulating the activity of other genes, such as signalling, chromatin biology and cell cycle regulation. Genetic interactions have profound effects during normal development and in disease. However, it is not clear how these interactions occur. To investigate this question, Laufer et al. used a technique called combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypes of Drosophila cells. This map revealed that a protein complex called the Ras pathway interacts with a gene called SWI/SNF, which is responsible for the production of proteins in the cell. In addition, mutations in one of these genes can alter the expression of another gene in another. These interactions are known as epistatic interactions, and it has been challenging to map them at large-scale because it was not possible to predict how the interactions would affect the effects of different genes in different diseases. By combining genetic interactions on 21 genes with information about how they interact with each other in human cancer cells ( called mitosis, for short ) and computer simulations of how genes interact in a disease-causing process called tumor necrosis factor ( CDNF ), this map provides a powerful resource for understanding how diseases occur in humans and other animals."

Male organs called stamens on the flowers make pollen that can be transferred \u2013 usually by insect carriers or the wind \u2013 to a female structure called the stigma on another plant . However , since many flowers contain both male and female organs , it is also possible for the pollen to land on the stigma of the same flower , leading to a process called \u201cself-fertilization\u201d . Many plants have developed mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization . For example , primroses produce two different types of flowers that arrange their stamens and stigmas differently . The stigma sits on the top of a stalk known as the style . Some primroses produce flowers with short stamens and a long style , resulting in the stigma being located high up in the flower ( \u201cpin\u201d flowers ) , while others produce flowers with a short style and long stamens ( \u201cthrum\u201d flowers ) . Primrose pollen is carried by insects and the different lengths of the styles and stamens make it more likely that pollen from a pin flower will land on the stigma of a thrum flower instead of a pin flower ( and vice versa ) . Although primrose flowers have fascinated botanists for centuries , the genes responsible for making the two types of flower had not been identified . Genetic studies indicated that different genes control the length of the stamens and style . However , these genes appear to be very close to each other on primrose DNA , which made it difficult to study them individually . Huu et al . identified a gene called CYP734A50 that is responsible for the difference in style length in the flowers of a primrose called Primula veris . The gene is only present in the plants that have thrum flowers across a wide range of primrose species and genetic mutations that inactivate the gene in these plants result in flowers with longer styles . CYP734A50 encodes an enzyme that breaks down plant hormones called brassinosteroids , which normally promote growth . Treating thrum flowers with brassinosteroids increased the length of the styles . Future challenges are to identify the other genes that are responsible for producing pin and thrum flowers and to understand how this group of genes evolved .",
        "first_gen": "Heterostyly is a widespread, wide-spread floral adaptation to promote outbreeding, yet its genetic basis and evolutionary origin remain poorly understood. For example, a plant called Primula ( primroses ) is the most common form of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae, and is thought to have evolved from a common ancestor of the Primaceae. However, it is not clear how this adaptation evolved. Now, Nowak et al. have used a technique called RNA-seq to identify the genetic code for the primula supergene. This revealed that a gene called CYP734A50 is present on the short- and long-homostyles of Primulas, but it was not known how it arose. Instead, the gene is found in a group of genes called the S-locus, which determines the length of a flower\u2019s reproductive organs and the number of flowers it produces. These genes are linked to a protein called brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme that determines which flowers are long and short. The gene was only present in one type of flower, called P. veris, while the other type was found to be long, short and low. Further experiments showed that the genes that control the style-length dimorphism were also present at the same time as the G locus that controls the L-morph gene. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how primulas evolved and shed light on their evolutionary origins."

The hypothalamus releases a chemical messenger called gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( or GnRH for short ) , which is then transported from the brain to the pituitary gland . GnRH activates the pituitary gland , which in turn releases reproductive hormones that control ovulation in females and sperm production in males . For this process to work correctly in females , the hypothalamus must release GnRH in appropriately timed pulses and produce one massive release , or \u201csurge\u201d , of GnRH to trigger ovulation . Two populations of neurons within the hypothalamus produce a peptide molecule called Kisspeptin and drive the activity and subsequent release of GnRH . One population resides in an area called the arcuate nucleus and the other in the preoptic nucleus . Recent findings suggest that the arcuate nucleus is the \u201cpulse generator\u201d responsible for triggering the rhythmic release of GnRH by the hypothalamus , whereas the preoptic nucleus induces the surge of GnRH . However , how these brain regions do this remains unclear . Using a technique called optogenetics , Qiu , Nestor et al . explored whether kisspeptin-producing neurons in the arcuate nucleus are able to communicate with each other to drive pulses of GnRH release . The idea was to selectively activate a subset of kisspeptin neurons in mice and determine whether this would activate the remaining neurons at the same time . Qiu , Nestor et al . introduced a light-sensitive protein into the kisspeptin-producing neurons on one side of the arcuate nucleus , and then used light to activate those neurons . As predicted , this caused kisspeptin neurons throughout the arcuate nucleus to coordinate their activity . In addition to their namesake peptide , kisspeptin-producing neurons also make the neurotransmitter glutamate , the excitatory peptide neurokinin B , and the inhibitory peptide dynorphin . Light-induced stimulation of the arcuate nucleus caused its kisspeptin neurons to also release neurokinin B and dynorphin , which synchronized the firing of the kisspeptin neurons . The hypothalamus then translates this coordinated activity into pulses of GnRH release . The light-induced stimulation also triggered the release of glutamate , which caused kisspeptin neurons within the preoptic nucleus to fire in bursts . This in turn robustly excited the GnRH neurons , giving rise to the surge of GnRH . These findings show that peptide and classical neurotransmitters collaborate to control GnRH neuron activity and , consequently , fertility . The results obtained by Qiu , Nestor et al . can be used to further explore kisspeptin-GnRH neuronal circuits , and to obtain insights into the role of neuronal peptide signaling in healthy as well as diseased states .",

This hormone is released by two groups of neurons called the AVPV/PeN neurons and the neurokinin B ( NKB ) neurons. Kisspeptin neurons are located in the anterior preoptic area of a cell and release peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters, which are released in response to LH secretion. However, it is not clear how these neurons coordinate their activity. Now, Navarro et al. have used a combination of optogenetics, molecular pharmacology and single cell electrophysiology to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the Kiss1 and NeK1 neurons synchronize their firing activity and how they release the hormone. The experiments show that a protein called dynorphin ( which is produced by the neurons ) and a neurotransmitter called glutamate are involved in synchronizing the firing of these two types of cells. In the experiments, a light-sensitive mouse brain was exposed to a fluorescent light, and it triggered the release of two proteins that are essential for hormone production. These proteins were then switched on and off by a process known as photostimulation. Further experiments showed that the synapses between the two protein-coupled cells were synchronized and that this synchronized activity led to the secretion of GnRH."

As an embryo develops , its cells divide and specialise into distinct lineages . Cells in each lineage go on to form a restricted number of cell types that are required to make a specific tissue . As such , during early development , cells switch from being \u2018pluripotent\u2019 , with the potential to become the many different cell types , to committing to one particular cell lineage . Controlling this process involves a huge number of signalling proteins and pathways . One such protein is bone morphogenetic protein , or BMP for short , which has a number of different roles in embryo development: for example , it stops pluripotent cells turning into nerve tissue , and it also encourages embryonic stem cells to contribute to the \u2018mesoderm\u2019 of the early embryo ( which goes on to form the muscles , connective tissues and some blood cells ) . How these two actions are linked , and whether they depend on similar signalling pathways , was unknown . BMP is also known to trigger the production of proteins known as \u2018Id factors\u2019\u2014which stands for \u2018inhibitor of differentiation\u2019 . Now , Malaguti et al . have investigated the roles of BMP and Id factors in controlling mouse embryo development and found , somewhat surprisingly , that these proteins needed help from a third protein to stop pluripotent cells turning into nerve tissue . This third protein , which is called E-Cadherin , normally helps cells to adhere to other cells . Malaguti et al . showed that losing this protein encourages cells to become either nerve or mesoderm tissues , and that a drop in E-Cadherin levels must occur before nerve tissue can form . Malaguti et al . also showed that encouraging cells to become part of the mesoderm requires BMP to activate another pathway , which does not require E-Cadherin . The two effects of BMP can be uncoupled by adjusting the levels of this protein . At low concentrations , BMP can keep cells pluripotent , but it cannot encourage cells to commit to a mesoderm fate . At higher doses , however , BMP \u2018primes\u2019 cells to respond to the signals that trigger their development into mesoderm tissue . The findings of Malaguti et al . suggest that manipulating both E-Cadherin and BMP signalling could improve our ability to generate useful cell types , such as neurons , from stem cells grown in laboratory cultures .",

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which this protein is regulated. Now, Thiery et al. have used a technique called reporter strategy to examine the effects of a gene called Id1 on the development of embryonic stem ( ES ) cells in mouse embryos. The experiments show that the gene that encodes the protein helps to regulate the expression of the stem cell adhesion molecule ( Cdh1 ), which is important for the differentiation of mesodermal and neural tissues. This gene is expressed in cells that have been genetically modified so that they can be grown in a well-defined environment. These cells then undergo a process called morphogenetic events that allow them to be carefully monitored in order to identify which cells are most likely to develop into the cells they need to form. As a result, the results of these experiments reveal that cells with a low level of Cdc1 are more likely than non-pluripotent cells not to produce Cd1. Further work is now needed to understand how this process works, and whether it also works in other contexts."

These hollow filaments support the cell\u2019s shape and help to transport different materials around within it . They also form a hair-like projection on the cell surface called the primary cilium , which helps the cell sense its environment . Most microtubules in an animal cell are organized by a structure called the centrosome , which has two smaller cylindrical structures called centrioles at its core . In cells that are not dividing , these two centrioles are different in age . The older of the two centrioles was assembled at least two cell divisions ago and is commonly called the \u201cmother\u201d centriole . The younger one , which was assembled the previous time the cell divided , is called the \u201cdaughter\u201d centriole . Most activities at the centrosome are controlled by the mother centriole . For example , the mother centriole contains protein complexes called appendages that allow it to dock at the cell surface and build the cilium . The mother centriole also contains a complex of proteins called the pericentriolar material , which helps it assemble microtubules and anchor them in place . In contrast , the daughter centriole lacks appendages , does not form a cilium , has less pericentriolar material and so assembles fewer microtubules . Why the daughter centriole cannot recruit these protein complexes remains a mystery . One possibly important difference between mother and daughter centrioles is that daughter centrioles in non-dividing cells have much higher levels of a protein called Cep120 . Now , Betleja et al . have studied the role of this protein in more detail . Experiments with mouse and human cells show that Cep120 plays an important inhibitory role at the daughter centriole . When the production of Cep120 was blocked , more pericentriolar material associated with the daughter centriole , and more microtubules were assembled by the centrosome . This interfered with the movement of other proteins to the centrosome , which ultimately disrupted both the centrosome\u2019s ability to assemble cilia and the cell\u2019s ability to sense its environment . The findings of Betleja et al . show that a Cep120-dependent mechanism actively regulates the centrosome\u2019s function in non-dividing cells . These experiments uncover a potentially new type of molecular defect that may be responsible for diseases caused by faulty cilia , such as Joubert Syndrome and Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy . The next challenge will be to understand how Cep120 inhibits the levels of pericentriolar material only at the daughter centriole but not the mother centriole .",

This complex is also known as a \u201cdaughter centroid\u201d. Previous studies have shown that a protein called Cep120 plays a critical role in controlling the formation of this complex. But it is not clear why CEP120 is restricted from recruiting these proteins. To investigate this question, Hori, Toda et al. used a technique called genome-editing to study the activity of a gene called CRISPR/Cas9 in mice and human cells. These experiments showed that the gene for a specific protein that encodes the daughter centrorole is blocked from producing the protein. Further experiments revealed that this protein is only found on the mother centrioole at the end of each cell cycle. In addition, it was also found to be enriched on other proteins that are important for forming the scaffolding and anchoring structures in quiescent cells, as well as in other types of cells that have been genetically engineered to have the same protein in their DNA. When this was not the case, these findings reveal a potentially new molecular defect that may explain the pathogenesis of certain diseases such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome."

Rosa , Bos et al . used a sensor that showed where glutamate is found in the developing retina .

Humans and most animals are bilateral , whereas jellyfish and starfish are not . Bilateral symmetry can take many forms\u2014as demonstrated by the differences between flies , frogs and humans\u2014but all bilaterians express many of the same genes during development . One of these groups of genes is known as the Hox family . The expression of specific Hox genes at specific times instructs cells in the developing embryo to adopt different fates according to their position along the anterior\u2013posterior ( head to tail ) axis . The patterning function of Hox genes relies on the presence of two additional cofactors that belong to the so-called TALE family . Although both Hox and TALE proteins were present early on during animal evolution , it is unclear how and when the interactions between them first began to generate symmetrical body plans . Now , Hudry et al . have provided insights into the origin of the Hox-TALE network by analysing the expression and molecular properties of Hox and TALE proteins from various multicellular and unicellular organisms . These experiments revealed that Hox and TALE proteins of the sea anemone Nematostella , which belongs to a group of animals called cnidarians that have radial rather than bilateral symmetry , interact with one another in a similar manner to the interactions seen in bilaterians . Hudry et al . then showed that two Nematostella Hox genes were able to substitute for their bilaterian equivalents in fruit flies , and that a Nematostella TALE gene was able to take over neuronal functions of its equivalent in Xenopus frogs . This striking conservation of function between species suggests that Hox and TALE genes were already working together in the common ancestor of all bilaterian and cnidarian animals . By contrast , TALE members from a unicellular amoeba were unable to interact with Hox proteins , suggesting that Hox\u2013TALE interactions first emerged in multicellular animals . In addition to increasing our knowledge of highly conserved Hox signalling , these data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that gave rise to the symmetrical body plan that has been adopted , and adapted , by the majority of animals since .",

These genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of the planula larva, which is known as the anterior\u2013aboral axis.

It is thought that these networks evolved to provide information about the shape of an animal\u2019s body during development, but it was not known how they evolved. Now, Heffer, Pick et al. have used a technique called BiFC to study the interactions between different genes in the embryo of a sea anemone called Nematostella vectensis. The experiments show that the proteins that make up this network are also present in other species, including ctenophores, sponges, and placozoans. In addition, the researchers found that some of these proteins also have an ancestral generic motif, called the hexapeptide, that is present on the surface of each protein. Together, these findings suggest that this \u2018Hox-TALE\u2018 network emerged from a specific molecular motif that was present at the beginning of evolution. Further experiments showed that other proteins from different species also had a similar motif on their surface. This suggests that a group of proteins called homeobox and TALE proteins may have evolved together to give the same shape and function in different animals. To test this hypothesis, Meis and Chourrout compared the DNA sequences of different proteins to the genes of other animals that had similar patterns of expression in their own cells. Maintaining the similarity between the two proteins revealed that they had evolved independently from the common ancestor of many other protein families. Moreover, they were able to change their expression patterns in a variety of ways that were likely important for differentiating their roles in animal development."

However , the space between the two nerve cells at at synapse , called the synaptic cleft , is no more than 40 nanometers wide . This is about 25 times thinner than a human hair , and too small to be seen with light microscopy . Electron microscopy can visualize synapses , but does not work in living tissue . The only other option is to attach a fluorescent label \u2013 either a dye or a man-made crystal called a quantum dot \u2013 to a protein found in synapses and monitor the resulting fluorescence . Though the probe must be small enough to pass through the synaptic cleft to do this . Using fluorescence microscopy , researchers have examined the distribution in synapses of proteins called AMPA receptors , which have a key role in memory . Multiple studies have shown groups of AMPA receptors gathered outside synapses . This has led to the suggestion that during learning , AMPA receptors wait outside the synapse until a space becomes available within the synapse\u2019s membrane . However , this has yet to be confirmed directly , in part because conventional fluorescent dyes and quantum dots are too bulky to enter synaptic clefts when bound to a receptor . Lee et al . have now developed a quantum dot that is only 10 nanometers wide and therefore small enough to enter the synaptic cleft with an AMPA receptor attached . These small quantum dots were then used to label AMPA receptors in neurons collected from rats and then grown in a petri dish , which provided a completely new view of synapses . The images show that the majority of AMPA receptors in neurons circulate within confined domains \u2013 a little like holding pens \u2013 inside the synapse , rather than waiting outside as previously assumed . Labeling the receptors with smaller 4-nanometer-wide fluorescent tags produces a similar picture . Further work is still need to determine how AMPA receptors get into the synapse and contribute to new memories .",
        "first_gen": "Neurons communicate with each other via a network of connections called synapses. These connections are made by molecules called ionotropic glutamate receptors ( or iGluRs for short ), which bind to receptors on the surface of the synapse membrane. When the receptor is active, it travels to and from the synaptic cleft, where it is released into the cell. However, when the receptors are inactive, they do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. This suggests that AMPARs are only active when they are in the post-synaptic membrane, and are not active in other locations. To investigate this, Cai et al. used a technique called super-resolution microscopy to study the movement and movement of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors in rat hippocampal neurons. The experiments show that the size and shape of these amo- and exocytosis sites are very different from those found outside of synaptic membranes, suggesting that these sites may not be active at the same time. Further work is now needed to understand how the activity of AMPA receptors is regulated by the presence of fluorescent dyes or other fluorescent proteins. In the future, these findings may help scientists to better understand the mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity."

If the level of oxygen in the brain decreases \u2013 for example when a blood vessel becomes blocked \u2013 neurons begin to die , and permanent brain damage can result . A shortage of oxygen first causes sodium ion channels within the surface membrane of the neurons to open . Sodium ions then flow into the cells through these open channels to trigger a cascade of events inside the cells that ultimately results in their death . Plant et al . now reveal how oxygen deficiency , otherwise known as hypoxia , rapidly increases the flow of sodium ions into brain cells . By inducing hypoxia in neurons from the rat brain , Plant et al . show that a lack of oxygen causes the SUMOylation \u2013 a process whereby a series of enzymes work together to attach a Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier ( or SUMO ) protein \u2013 of specific sodium ion channels in under a minute . The channels linked to the SUMO protein , a subtype called NaV1 . 2 , open more readily than unmodified channels , allowing more sodium ions to enter the neurons . Plant et al . study granule cells of the cerebellum , the most numerous type of neuron in the human brain . Further investigation is required to determine if SUMOylation of NaV1 . 2 channels underlies the response of other neurons to hypoxia as well . It also remains to be discovered whether molecules that block the SUMOylation of NaV1 . 2 channels , or that prevent the flow of sodium ions through these channels , could reduce the number of brain cells that die in low-oxygen conditions such as strokes .",
        "first_gen": "Hypoxia is a condition in which the brain loses electrical activity in response to changes in the amount of sodium ions that enter and leave the cell. This is known as a hypoxic insult, and it has been linked to brain damage in humans and other animals. In humans, the first effect of hypoxias is to increase the voltage-gated sodium ( NaV ) channels at the surface of cells. However, it is not clear how this process works. Now, Henley et al. have used a technique called microscopy to study the activity of a signaling pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons ( CGN ). The experiments show that the SUMO pathway activates the small Ubiquitin-like Modifier, a protein that encodes the sodium ion channel, which is present in all eukaryotic cells and is widely distributed throughout the nervous system. Further experiments showed that this pathway is activated by a molecule called SUMOMO. It is thought to be responsible for the activation of the large ion channels, but it was not fully understood how it works in mammals. When a rat neuron was exposed to a chemical called tetrodotoxin ( or TIIIA for short ), an enzyme that is active on the membrane of its cell surface was switched on and off. After 40 s of exposure to the chemical, this enzyme was able to change the position of one of three ion-subunits that are present on its surface and activate the other two ion subunits. These two enzymes were found to interact with each other in a way that made it possible for them to switch on or off in less than 30 s. Together, these findings suggest that these two pathways are important targets for neuroprotective interventions. They could also be used to treat epilepsy and febrile seizures."

As a result , outside temperatures can also affect the spread of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes . This has left scientists wondering how climate change may affect the spread of mosquito-borne diseases . Predicting the effects of climate change on such diseases is tricky , because many interacting factors , including temperatures and rainfall , affect mosquito populations . Also , rising temperatures do not always have a positive effect on mosquitoes \u2013 they may help mosquitoes initially , but it can get too warm even for these animals . Climate change could affect the Ross River virus , the most common mosquito-borne disease in Australia . The virus infects 2 , 000 to 9 , 000 people each year and can cause long-term joint pain and disability . Currently , the virus spreads year-round in tropical , northern Australia and seasonally in temperate , southern Australia . Large outbreaks have occurred outside of Australia , and scientists are worried it could spread worldwide . Now , Shocket et al . have built a model that predicts how the spread of Ross River virus changes with temperature . Shocket et al . used data from laboratory experiments that measured mosquito and virus performance across a broad range of temperatures . The experiments showed that ~26\u00b0C ( 80\u00b0F ) is the optimal temperature for mosquitoes to spread the Ross River virus . Temperatures below 17\u00b0C ( 63\u00b0F ) and above 32\u00b0C ( 89\u00b0F ) hamper the spread of the virus . These temperature ranges match the current disease patterns in Australia where human cases peak in March . This is two months after the country\u2019s average temperature reaches the optimal level and about how long it takes mosquito populations to grow , infect people , and for symptoms to develop . Because northern Australia is already near the optimal temperature for mosquitos to spread the Ross River virus , any climate warming should decrease transmission there . But warming temperatures could increase the disease\u2019s transmission in the southern part of the country , where most people live . The model Shocket et al . created may help the Australian government and mosquito control agencies better plan for the future .",

The virus is found in tropical, subtropical and temperate areas of Australia, where most people live. However, it is not well understood how the virus spreads in these areas. Now, Mordecai et al. have developed a mathematical model that predicts that the transmission of the disease is year-round endemic in the tropics, and declines at high and low temperatures. In addition, the model predicted that transmission peaks at intermediate temperatures ( 26. 0 and 31. 5\u00b0C ), while the lower temperatures of low and high temperatures are more likely to be the same. This suggests that this is the case for most diseases, but not all diseases. For example, a mosquito-borne pathogen called Aedes [Ochlerotatus] vigilax is most commonly transmitted to humans in Australia and the Pacific Islands. But it was not clear whether this was true for other mosquito species, such as the saltmarsh mosquitoes, which are responsible for many diseases transmitted by humans. To address this question, researchers used mathematical models to model the distribution of disease transmission in Australian mosquitoes. These models were then used to predict the temperature at which a disease was transmitted in a tropical area. When temperatures were above the thermal optimum, transmission peaked at moderate temperatures and then declined to zero at the low temperature. Overall, this model accurately predicted the timing and extent of transmission. It also predicted a seasonal peak in human cases. Further work is now needed to understand how climate change will affect the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease."

Electrodes on the surface of the scalp , or within the brain itself , can detect this coordinated activity in the form of brain waves , or oscillations . Different regions of the brain produce oscillations with different frequencies . Areas that control movement , known collectively as the motor system , generate oscillations with a frequency of 25 to 40 cycles per second , called beta oscillations . These emerge when individuals are paying attention , processing cues to decide where to move , or waiting to move . Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 who suffer from tremors , slowed movements , and have trouble initiating movements \u2013 show increased beta oscillations when their symptoms are worst compared to when their symptoms are well controlled . Understanding how beta oscillations affect behavior might therefore reveal how exaggerated beta oscillations contribute to symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease . However , existing tools for activating or silencing neurons do not allow us to manipulate large groups of neurons with fine enough control to study oscillations precisely . Khanna and Carmena have now solved this problem by training rhesus macaque monkeys to mentally control their own brain waves . The monkeys , which had electrodes implanted in their brains , learned to increase or decrease their beta oscillations on demand . After achieving the correct level of beta oscillations , the monkeys had to reach towards a target with their arm in order to obtain a reward . Khanna and Carmena found that the monkeys took longer to initiate arm reaches when they had higher levels of beta oscillations . Further , when the monkeys increased their beta oscillations , populations of neurons exhibited patterns of activity that looked very different to the patterns occurring at the start of movement . This suggests that when neurons generate beta oscillations , the motor system is pausing at the expense of being ready to quickly start moving . This finding meshes well with previous evidence since it is sensible to pause the motor system when paying close attention to a task , deciding where to move , and while waiting . Too much pausing may slow down movements and it may become difficult to initiate them , potentially explaining the link between worsened symptoms and higher beta oscillations seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease . Overall , the findings of Khanna and Carmena indicate that beta oscillations reflect brain states in which individuals are pausing , and provide a new tool for studying how oscillations relate to behavior .",

This oscillation is thought to occur during specific motor actions, such as isometric contraction and precision reaching. However, it is not clear how the activity of the motor cortex is linked to the behavior of other brain cells. To investigate this question, Fries et al. trained three macaque monkeys to perform a motor task. The monkeys were trained to carry out the task by moving their arms and legs. When the monkeys reached an arm-reaching position, they were asked to move their brains to a more instructed state. After performing this task, the animals were instructed to reach out their left arm and perform the arm reach. These monkeys then performed the same task again, but this time with a different brain cell that had been trained in a similar way. In the experiments, three of these monkeys performed a task called arm reaching, which involved moving the right arm to an instructed position and then performing a hand-to-hand movement. During the experiment, each monkey\u2019s brain activity was recorded as it moved its head and body parts. It was then possible to measure how much of this activity changed after the monkey had reached the target. Future studies are needed to understand how these brain changes reflect the underlying neural activity that is involved in motor activity."

The disease affects around 2% of the world\u2019s population , and is most common in people of northern European descent . TNF is one of the key proteins in the development of psoriasis and drugs that inhibit TNF have been very successful in the treatment of this disease . However , these drugs are expensive and for unknown reasons at least 10% of patients do not respond to them . Attempts to develop better drugs for psoriasis would be assisted by an improved understanding of this disease in terms of the genes and proteins involved . Etemadi et al . set out to obtain a more detailed molecular understanding of this disease by developing new mouse models of the condition . Mice were genetically engineered such that a key gene was deleted specifically from the skin cells that form the main barrier to the environment . These mice demonstrated that defects in skin cells called keratinocytes , rather than defects in the immune response , could lead to a psoriasis-like disease . Etemadi et al . also showed that the skin cells with this genetic defect die in the presence of TNF and this cell death in mice caused a rapidly-appearing form of psoriasis . However , in the absence of TNF the mice still developed psoriasis , albeit more slowly . In this case , the condition was due to an excessive activation of a protein called NF-\u03baB , which is known to play a role in maintaining balance in the immune system and in psoriasis . These findings reveal how keratinocytes , cell death and inflammation can directly contribute to psoriasis-like conditions in mice .

These receptors are known as cytokines, and they are responsible for regulating the activity of certain immune cells. However, it is not clear how the role of TRAF2 is regulated in adult tissues. Previous studies have shown that mice that have a mutation in the gene that codes for a protein called sphingosine-1-phosphate do not have the same regulatory role as normal mice. This is because the protein is unable to interact with other proteins, such as proteins that are called ubiquitin E3 ligases. It is thought that this protein can only be activated by a single protein, called SPHK1, but it has not been shown to be required for this role. Now, Alvarez et al. have studied mice with a mutant form that had a mutated version that did not contain the mutated gene. The experiments show that the mutant mutant mice had less than one protein that was required to activate the SPH1 protein. In this mutant, the mice developed a skin condition called psoriasis-like epidermal hyperplasia and skin inflammation caused by excessive apoptosis and the death of many cells, including lymphocytes and keratinocytes. Further work is now needed to find out if this is the case in adults."

These molecules are held inside small compartments called synaptic vesicles . Once a neuron receives an electrical stimulus , the membranes that enclose the synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane that encloses the neuron . This releases the neurotransmitters , which then trigger an electrical signal in the neighboring cell . Once the neurotransmitters are released , the vesicle membrane is rapidly reinternalized from the plasma membrane in a process called endocytosis and then recycled , ready for the next round of signal transmission . The process of synaptic vesicle membrane endocytosis and recycling has been studied extensively , and several different mechanisms by which it occurs have been identified . The best understood relies on a protein called clathrin , and is thought to be essential for nervous system function . Recently , however , a mechanism of vesicle membrane endocytosis that does not involve clathrin was identified . This mechanism , called bulk endocytosis , involves reinternalizing large regions of the cell plasma membrane to generate large compartments called vacuoles , from which new synaptic vesicles eventually form . This mechanism has been observed when neurons fire at high frequency . The cellular processes underlying bulk endocytosis are not well understood , although several studies suggest proteins called dynamins are important . Wu et al . simulated the conditions a cell experiences during high levels of activity in neurons that lacked the two major dynamins present at the synapses between neurons\u2014dynamin 1 and dynamin 3 . In these neurons , robust bulk endocytosis occurred , suggesting that these two major neuronal dynamins do not play a role in this process . Furthermore , formation of vesicles from the vacuoles generated by bulk endocytosis appeared to be clathrin-independent . These findings point to the occurrence of a pathway of synaptic vesicle recycling that bypasses the need for dynamin 1 and 3 as well as for clathrin . To reconcile these results with previously published work , Wu et al . propose that dynamins may only be required for processes that also require clathrin . But how are vesicles recycled during bulk endocytosis if dynamins are not involved ? There are currently few leads to base alternative mechanisms on . Further work is required to unravel this mystery , and to provide insights into how clathrin-dependent and independent recycling processes are linked during high neuronal activity .",

Synapses contain many different types of synaptic vesicles, which are made up of different parts of the cell called synapses. Each synapse contains a small area of membrane called the plasma membrane, and these membranes are quickly recaptured from the membrane and recycled for the generation of new synaptic connections. However, it is not clear how this process works. To investigate this question, Raimondi et al. used a technique called electron microscopy ( EM ) to study the activity of neurons in a worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. The experiments showed that the cells in the worm\u2019s central nervous system produce large endocytic vacuoles, or \u2018bulk\u201d endosomes, that are smaller than the membranes of individual neurons. When the neurons were exposed to high levels of a strong stimulus, they were unable to separate from their membranes. Instead, the synaptic membrane was re-circulated in parallel with the movement of their membrane. This suggests that a process called clathrin is involved in this reformation. In the experiments, dynamin was added selectively after the neuron had been knocked out, but it was not accompanied by the accumulation of large clusters of endocomes. These clusters did not disappear as quickly as previously thought, suggesting that this is the case. Further experiments also revealed that there is a pathway that bypasses the requirement for a large cluster of cells to form new synaptops. Finally, these findings support the idea that other mechanisms are also involved. Future work will be needed to understand how these mechanisms work and to find out how they work."

But , like any medication , glucocorticoids have both benefits and risks: people who take glucocorticoids for a long time have an increased risk of diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular disease , and death . Because of the risks associated with taking glucocorticoids , it is very important for physicians to tailor the dose to each patient\u2019s needs . Doing this can be tricky , because the levels of glucocorticoids in a patient\u2019s blood are not a good indicator of the medication\u2019s activity in the body .

As a first step towards developing such a test , Chantzichristos et al . identified a potential way to measure glucocorticoid activity in patient\u2019s blood . In the experiments , blood samples were collected from ten patients with adrenal insufficiency both when they were on no medication , and when they were taking a glucocorticoid to replace their missing hormones . Next , the blood samples were analyzed to determine which genes were turned on and off in each patient with and without the medication . They also compared small molecules in the blood called metabolites and tiny pieces of genetic material called microRNAs that turn genes on and off . The experiments revealed networks of genes , metabolites , and microRNAs that are associated with glucocorticoid activity , and one microRNA called miR-122-5p stood out as a potential way to measure glucocorticoid activity . To verify this microRNA\u2019s usefulness , Chantzichristos et al . looked at levels of miR-122-5p in people participating in three other studies and confirmed that it was a good indicator of the glucocorticoid activity .

To address this issue, Oster, Cidlowski et al. studied 10 people with adrenal insufficiency, a type of diabetes that is linked to high levels of cortisol, in the blood. These patients were exposed to a drug that increases the production of a protein that helps to regulate cortisol levels. They were then treated with a combination of drugs that reduced the amount of corticosterone in their blood and reduced their intake of sugar. The results showed that the effect of these drugs was similar to those seen in humans. However, it was not clear how these effects were measured. In the experiments, the researchers used a technique called multi-omic analysis to identify biomarkers that could be used to determine whether or not the drug was effective. When the volunteers were given a placebo, they were shown to be more sensitive to cortisol than those who were not given the placebo. Further experiments revealed that a gene called miR-122-5p, which is expressed in blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, was correlated with the activity of genes and metabolites regulated by cortisol. A similar gene expression was found in subjects with Addison's disease and healthy controls.

However , when amino acids are scarce , mTOR turns off , which slows down protein production and causes the cell to begin scavenging amino acids by digesting parts of itself . Studies of mTOR have shown that the protein cannot turn on until it visits the surface of small sacks in the cell called lysosomes . These are the major sites within cell where proteins and other molecules are broken down . Scientists know how mTOR gets to the lysosomes , but not how quickly the process occurs .

When a protein is lacking in amino acids, the complex switches on or off the activity of this protein, which causes it to become inactive.

In the experiments, a fluorescent molecule was used to detect the active form of RapTOR, while another molecule \u2013 called Sestrin2 \u2013 was present on lysosomes. Both of these molecules were able to activate the protein in a way that was similar to that seen in living cells.

The dendritic cells recognize the antigens with the help of receptor proteins called C-type lectin receptors ( CLRs ) . These receptors can bind to sugar molecules that are naturally found on many antigens .

The experiments show that injecting mice with Ovalbumin-LewisX triggers a much stronger immune response than normal Ovalbumin does . This enhanced response was not observed in mice that lacked the MGL1 receptor , which suggests that this receptor is involved in detecting Ovalbumin-LewisX . Furthermore , the dendritic cells store the altered Ovalbumin for longer than they store normal Ovalbumin , which gives the cells more time to present the altered Ovalbumin to other immune cells . Vaccines and some other therapies help to boost immune responses to viruses and tumors by exposing the body to antigens . However , these therapies often use antigens that don\u2019t have sugar molecules attached to them , or are missing the sugar molecules they would normally have .

Antigens that originate from tumor cells or viruses are known as glycosylated, but it is not clear how these glycan-binding proteins work. One way to find out is to use a molecule called Ovalbumin ( OVA ) that recognizes the glycans of an antigen and then sends it to a receptor called MGL1. This receptor is called the C-type lectin receptor, and is responsible for sending the antigen to the CD8+ T cell. However, little is known about how the complex of lectins that bind to these receptors works. Singh, Singh et al. have now used a technique called mass spectrometry to study the effects of the modification on the production of OVO in mice. In the experiments, the mice were exposed to high amounts of oVA and were unable to distinguish between the two types of T cells. Further experiments showed that the modifications made by the LAMP1 receptor alter the ability of these T-cells to recognize the glycans. These findings suggest that a modified version of UVA can be used to switch on or off the receptors that recognize and transmit the G-protein complex molecules. It is also possible that this modification may be beneficial for other immune responses, such as the development of long-lasting memory."

In some bacteria, it is possible to control hundreds of genes in a group. For example, a bacterium called Burkholderia thailandensis uses a protein called acyl-homoserine lactone ( AHL ) to regulate the production of milk proteins. The AHLs are made by members of a family of signal synthases called the T6SS-1 family, which are involved in regulating the expression of many genes, including many of those that are important for public health. However, there are also many other mechanisms that control the growth of bacteria in groups. One of these mechanisms is called type VI secretion. This allows bacteria to produce a toxin that is harmful to the environment, such as milk protein, but it does not affect how the bacteria grow. To test this hypothesis, Russell et al. genetically engineered the B. thaiensis bacteria so that they could produce toxin-resistant mutant bacteria. These mutants were able to grow faster than the wild-type bacteria when they were grown on a solid agar surface. They also had a higher fitness advantage over the mutant that was grown in broth cocultures. Further experiments showed that the cells that produced the toxin and its antitoxin were more likely to multiply when the bacterial cells were growing on the surface of their host cell than when it was growing in the laboratory. Finally, the experiments show that this mechanism can be used to police and constrain mutant growth. Future work is now needed to understand how this system works."

For example , the communication between two brain areas called the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex is essential for memory and attention . However , it is still unclear how these interactions are established when the brain develops . Now , by looking at how the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex \u2018work\u2019 together in newborn mouse pups , Ahlbeck et al . hope to understand how these brain areas start to connect . In particular , the groups of neurons that kick start the development of the circuits required for information processing need to be identified . Recording the brains of the pups revealed that electrical activity in a particular sub-division of the hippocampus activated neurons in the prefrontal cortex . In fact , a specific population of neurons in this area was needed for the circuits in the prefrontal cortex to mature . In further experiments , the neurons from this population in the hippocampus were manipulated so they could be artificially activated in the brain using light . When stimulated , these neurons generated electrical activity , which was then relayed through the neurons all the way to the prefrontal cortex . There , this signal triggered local neuronal circuits . Thanks to this activation , these circuits could \u2018wire\u2019 together , and start establishing the connections necessary for mental tasks or memory in adulthood . The brain of the mouse pups used by Ahlbeck et al . was approximately in the same developmental state as the brain of human fetuses in the second or third trimester of pregnancy . These findings may therefore inform on how the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex start connecting in humans . Problems in the way brain areas interact during early development could be partly responsible for certain neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illnesses , such as schizophrenia . Understanding these processes at the cellular level may therefore be the first step towards finding potential targets for treatment .",
        "first_gen": "In the adult rodent brain, the activity of neurons in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus plays a key role in learning and memory. However, it is not clear how these regions of the brain coordinate their activity during development. Previous studies have suggested that a pattern of activity called the \u2018spindle bursts\u2019 is responsible for these oscillations. These bursts are accompanied by rapid discharges ( gamma and gamma waves ) that are faster than the beta waves. In the hippocampus, these bursts synchronize the firing and discharging of individual neurons, but they do not occur at the same frequency as theta bursts. Instead, they occur in different frequency bands. This suggests that the spindle burst is necessary for the development of memory and attentional abilities early in life. Now, Luhmann et al. have used a technique called optogenetic manipulation to manipulate the electrical activity in a region of either the dorsal hippocampus or the intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age. The experiments show that this region is mainly coupled with the hippocampal hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via direct axonal projections called pyramidal projections. Further experiments showed that these projections were also activated by electrical signals from neurons that were either active in either dorsal or intermediate hippocampus during the early stages of development, whereas they were not activated in intermediate or ventral hippocampi. Overall, this work provides new insights into the mechanisms that drive the formation of long-range connections between neurons and the developing brain."

When a gene is switched on , the section of DNA is copied to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) in a process called transcription . These messenger RNAs are then used as templates for protein production . In animals , plants and other eukaryotic organisms , an enzyme called RNA polymerase II is responsible for making messenger RNA molecules during transcription . This enzyme is made up of several proteins , the largest of which contains a long tail , called the carboxy-terminal domain . This domain is crucial for transcription because it serves as a landing platform for other enzymes that help to make the RNA molecules . The carboxy-terminal domain contains multiple repeats of a string of seven amino acids ( the building blocks of proteins ) . Normally , each repeat contains three amino acids called serines . However , in humans and other mammals , one of these serines is often substituted with another amino acid called lysine instead . This lysine ( referred to as Lysine-7 ) was known to be modified by the addition of a chemical group called an 'acetyl' tag , but it was not clear how this tag affected transcription . Dias , Rito , Torlai Triglia et al . carried out an in-depth study into how Lysine-7 is modified in mouse cells , and what effects these modifications have on transcription . The experiments show that Lysine-7 can also be modified by the addition of a different chemical group , called a 'methyl' tag . This new modification is also found in flies , worms and human cells , which suggests that it is generally important for transcription . Next , Dias , Rito , Torlai Triglia et al . found that in mouse stem cells , methyl tags are added to Lysine-7 during the earliest steps of transcription , before the acetyl tags are added . Further experiments show that a balance between the addition of methyl tags and acetyl tags to Lysine-7 fine-tunes the activity of RNA polymerase II . These findings add to our understanding of how cells control the activity of RNA polymerase II at different genes . Future challenges are to find out which enzymes are responsible for adding and removing these chemical tags , and how the balance between the methyl and acetyl modifications is controlled .",
        "first_gen": "RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) is a protein-coding enzyme that is involved in the production of proteins and other molecules. RNA polymerases are made up of a series of repeating repeats that are then phosphorylated at the end of the RNA molecule to form a molecule called a chromatin, which is then used to make proteins. The chromatization process is carried out by a group of enzymes called transcription factors that control the activity of genes and the expression of messenger RNAs ( mRNA molecules ). This process involves a complex array of modifications to RNA molecules that can be made at different stages of transcription. For example, one of these modifications, called K7me1, is present at a region called the C-terminal domain ( CTD ), and is responsible for the assembly of new RNA. However, it is not clear how this modification works in vertebrates and invertebrates. Simonti et al. used biochemical and genome-wide approaches to study the role of CTDs at gene promoters in different organisms. First, the experiments showed that the proteins that make up the DNA were made in a structurally-disordered manner. Then, a second modification was made to another protein called Lysine-7. These two modifications were observed in both vertebrate and non-celled organisms, including humans and mammals. Together, these findings suggest that a balance between methylation and acetylation is important for gene expression. Future work is now needed to determine whether other modifications are also found in other organisms and how they interact with each other."

These develop from groups of cells called satellite cells , which are found near the surface of muscle fibers . Once the muscle is injured , the satellite cells are activated and can divide to form two cells with different properties . One remains a satellite cell , while the other forms a \u2018myoblast\u2019 that eventually fuses into a mature muscle fiber . Under normal conditions the satellite cells remain in a dormant state and do not divide , but it is not clear how they maintain this dormant state . To create a protein , the gene that encodes it is first \u2018transcribed\u2019 to produce a molecule called mRNA , which is then used as a template to build the protein . A protein called Tristetraprolin ( TTP ) can bind to mRNA molecules and cause them to break down or decay , and so TTP can prevent the mRNA from being used to make a protein . Hausburg , Doles et al . analyzed satellite cells from uninjured muscle and compared them with those from injured tissue . This revealed that when injured , the satellite cells reduced the abundance of several mRNAs , including TTP . Further investigation found that in satellite cells from uninjured tissue , TTP causes the decay of mRNA molecules that are used to produce a protein called MyoD . As MyoD helps the satellite cells to specialize , this decay therefore prevents the formation of myoblasts and keeps the satellite cells in a dormant state . In contrast , damage to the muscle tissue activates a signaling pathway that ultimately inactivates TTP . This enables more of the MyoD protein to be made and the myoblast population to expand . When Hausburg , Doles et al . experimentally reduced the levels of TTP inside satellite cells , the cells developed into myoblasts even when the tissue was uninjured . Thus , TTP is an important regulator that allows satellite cells to remain in a dormant state . In dormant adult stem cells , regulation of protein availability by RNA binding proteins , such as TTP , may co-ordinate rapid changes in metabolic state to promptly repair injured tissue . A major challenge will be to identify the group of proteins involved and determine the precise mechanisms involved in regulating their availability .",

However, they can also become quiescent and die when they are injured, which can lead to a loss of the muscle cell population. When a muscle injury occurs, the SC cells are unable to regenerate and self-renew to replenish the stem cell pool. This is due to the absence of a protein called MyoD, a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment. A protein known as Tristetraprolin ( or TTP for short ) is involved in this process, but it is not clear exactly how it works. To investigate this question, Farina et al. studied gene transcripts that were differentially expressed in mice that had been injured. The experiments show that the mRNA decay factor is a key component of this protein\u2019s activity, and that it plays a critical role in maintaining myoblast formation. In the experiments, mice were genetically engineered to lack the gene that encodes the protein. These mice also had a mutation in their gene expression that prevented them from producing the transcription factor. Further experiments showed that a gene called TRISTETRAPROlin was also expressed during the activation process of skeletal muscle satellites cells, suggesting that this gene regulation process is important for maintaining the healthy muscle population in the future."

Immune cells called macrophages stimulate inflammation when they detect bacteria and other microbes . However , the strength of the inflammatory response is tightly controlled to prevent too much inflammation when it is not necessary . There is evidence that an inability to control the activity of macrophages can lead to excessive inflammation that can in itself cause injury . Inflammatory bowel diseases , including Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis , occur when the intestine becomes inflamed in response to the bacteria that normally live there . Most patients with these diseases first present symptoms as young adults , but in rare cases the symptoms appear during infancy . Some patients who develop symptoms early in life carry a mutation in a gene encoding IL10R , a receptor protein that normally inhibits the ability of macrophages to cause inflammation . However , it was not known exactly when the inflammation begins in infants . Mice are often used in research as models of human health and disease . Redhu et al . investigated the role of IL10R in the intestines of infant mice . These experiments showed that the intestines of mutant mice that lacked the IL10R protein became inflamed as they were weaned from breast milk to a solid diet . This inflammation was accompanied by a greater increase in the number of actively recruited macrophages in the intestine of mutant mice compared to normal mice . Further experiments revealed that macrophages in the mutant mice activate many genes involved in inflammation . The transition from breast milk to a solid diet is accompanied by large increases in intestinal bacteria . Treating the mice with antibiotics decreased the number of bacteria in the intestines and reduced the level of inflammation , as did treating the mice with a compound that killed macrophages . The findings of Redhu et al . suggest that IL10R prevents macrophages from causing inflammation when infant mice are weaned . This , in turn , suggests that treatments that modify intestinal macrophages , as well as bacteria , could help infants that have , or are at risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease . In the longer-term , these findings might also aid the development of new treatments for older patients with inflammatory bowel diseases .",
        "first_gen": "Infants with defects in the interleukin 10 receptor ( IL10R ) are more likely to develop inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) than healthy infants. This is partly due to the fact that many of the genes involved in inflammation in infants are inherited from their parents. However, it is not clear whether the same genes also play an important role during the early stages of life, or if they are also important for the development of colitis. To address this question, Shouval et al. studied mice that lacked the gene for IL 10R in early childhood. The experiments show that mice lacking the receptor develop a condition called infantile-onset inflammation. These mice have a mutation in a gene that causes a protein known as the IL-10 receptor, which is found on the surface of macrophages. When the mice were exposed to a bacterium called clodronate, the immune cells that make up the mouse\u2019s intestine were less active than normal. In addition, these mice had fewer inflammatory cells in their gut lining, suggesting that the lack of IL11R signaling is necessary to prevent the formation of inflammation early in life. Further work is now needed to understand the role of this signaling pathway in preventing inflammation, and to identify the molecular mechanisms that contribute to this process."

This mechanism works by deactivating RNA sequences , the molecular templates cells can use to create proteins . Overall , RNA interference relies on the cell creating small RNA molecules that can target and inhibit the harmful RNA sequences that need to be silenced . More precisely , in round worms such as Caenorhabditis elegans , RNA interference happens in two steps . First , primary small RNAs identify the target sequences , which are then combatted by newly synthetised , secondary small RNAs . A number of proteins are also involved in both steps of the process . RNA interference is particularly important to preserve fertility , guarding sex cells against \u2018rogue\u2019 segments of genetic information that could be passed on to the next generation . In future sex cells , the proteins involved in RNA interference cluster together , forming a structure called a germ granule . Yet , little is known about the roles and identity of these proteins . To fill this knowledge gap , Manage et al . focused on the second stage of the RNA interference pathway in the germ granules of C . elegans , examining the molecules that physically interact with a key protein . This work revealed a new protein called SIMR-1 . Looking into the role of SIMR-1 showed that the protein is required to amplify secondary small RNAs , but not to identify target sequences . However , it only promotes the creation of secondary small RNAs if a specific subtype of primary small RNAs have recognized the target RNAs for silencing . Further experiments also showed that within the germ granule , SIMR-1 is present in a separate substructure different from any compartment previously identified . This suggests that each substep of the RNA interference process takes place at a different location in the granule . In both C . elegans and humans , disruptions in the RNA interference pathway can lead to conditions such as cancer or infertility . Dissecting the roles of the proteins involved in this process in roundworms may help to better grasp how this process unfolds in mammals , and how it could be corrected in the case of disease .",

These small RNAs are made up of a group of amino acids called Argonaute proteins, which are bound to piRNAs. In many organisms, the PiRNA pathway is controlled by the mutator complex. This complex consists of several different types of RNA molecules, each of which has a different role in regulating the activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, it is not clear what role these proteins play in C. elegans. To investigate this question, Chen et al. used a technique called CRISPR-Cas9 to identify the Tudor domain protein that plays a key role. It was found to bind to a region of DNA called the P granule, and to another region called Mutator foci, where the DNA is made. Further experiments showed that SIMR-1 is responsible for both the initiation and the silencing of PiRNA. The experiments also identified two other condensates, known as the T granules and Mutators Foci. Together, these two locations are the sites where a large number of different Piwi proteins are produced, while another condenser, called MATH-33, is required to make the same protein. Both of these sites are known to play important roles in controlling the activities of piRAs, but it was not known whether they also play a similar role for other proteins in other organisms such as worms and fruit fly larvae."

An area at the base of the brain called the cerebellum controls this effort , and synchronizes our muscles by sending messages in the form of electrical signals along cells called Purkinje neurons . These signals consist of steady \u2018tonic\u2019 activity or short \u2018bursts\u2019 of activity . Previous studies in unconscious mammals suggest that these neurons can spontaneously switch between the two types of electrical signals . However , it is not clear whether this switch occurs in awake animals , or how these nerve activities control muscle movements . It is technically challenging to record the voltage of single Purkinje neurons of conscious rodents , so Sengupta and Thirumalai avoided this problem by using zebrafish larvae instead . These larvae are small , transparent and lack a skull , which makes it possible to record the activity of the cerebellum using tiny glass electrodes . The experiments show that even when the larvae are awake , the Purkinje cells produce either spontaneous bursts or tonic activity and they can readily switch between the two . The switch is controlled in part by the voltage on the neurons' surface . A positive voltage is called the \u2018up\u2019 state , while a negative voltage is dubbed the \u2018down\u2019 state . Neurons in the \u2018up\u2019 state produced tonic pulses , while neurons in the \u2018down\u2019 state produced short bursts of activity with the help of an ion channel called AMPAR . Cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord carry the final command from the nervous system to the muscles . Sengupta and Thirumalai recorded the activity of motor neurons and Purkinje neurons at the same time . This revealed that Purkinje neurons receive a copy of the motor command that goes to the muscle and produce short bursts of electrical activity in response . This effect required AMPAR activity , and was blocked by molecules that inhibit AMPAR . Furthermore , Sengupta and Thirumalai report that the timing of these short bursts with respect to the motor command changes from one Purkinje neuron to another . Future work will investigate how the Purkinje neurons receive and process the information in the motor command .",

It is made up of three major parts: the corpus and the lateral lobe, which are subdivided into two layers. These layers are connected to each other by a network of spines called \u2018molecular fibers\u2019. Purkinje neurons in zebrafish are the only output neuron in the cerebular cortex, and they are able to switch from one state to another spontaneously or with current injection. However, it is not clear how these neurons can switch between different states at the same time. To investigate this question, Hsieh et al. recorded the activity patterns of neurons from a larval fish called Danio rerio in an unanesthetized state. The recordings showed that the neurons were active in both depolarized and \u201cdown\u201d states. In addition, the cells in this state were more active when they were exposed to current injections. This suggests that these cells are bistable in a variety of ways. For example, neurons that are active at different times of day and in different stages of development are less likely to spontaneously switch to one or the other than when the animals are awake. Further experiments show that this process is dependent on the activation of climbing fibers by climbing fiber ( CFs ) to trigger bursts of electrical activity. Moreover, this activity pattern is similar to that seen in electric fish and other animals, but it was not known whether the patterns observed in these animals were similar in humans or in animals that were not awake, or if they had been artificially induced. Now, Hamling, Vibulyaseck and H\u00e4usser have used a technique called whole-cell patch clamp recording to study the neural activity of a type of neuron known as a cerebrospinal cord ( or CCe for short ). Using this technique, they have shown that cells that have been genetically engineered to be active for a long time are more likely than those that do not have a cell membrane. Therefore, these findings provide a new model system for studying how neurons behave in awake animals."

One component , a protein called actin , self-assembles near the membrane into long filaments with many repeated subunits . These filaments grow against the membrane , pulling it inwards . But it was not clear how actin filaments organize in such a way that allows them to pull on the membrane with enough force \u2013 and without a template to follow . Akamatsu et al . set about identifying how actin operates during endocytosis by using computer simulations that were informed by measurements made in living cells . The simulations included information about the location of actin and other essential molecules , along with the details of how these molecules work individually and together . Akamatsu et al . also developed a method to count the numbers of molecules of a key protein at individual sites of endocytosis . High-resolution imaging was then used to create 3D pictures of actin and endocytosis in action in human cells grown in the laboratory . The analysis showed the way actin filaments arrange themselves depends on the starting positions of a few key molecules that connect to actin . Imaging confirmed that , like a pole-vaulting pole , the flexible actin filaments bend to store energy and then release it to pull the membrane inwards during endocytosis . Finally , the simulations predicted that the collection of filaments adapts its shape and size in response to the resistance of the elastic membrane . This makes the system opportunistic and adaptable to the unpredictable environment within cells .",

These networks are formed by a protein called Arp2/3, a group of protein-binding proteins that are involved in the assembly of these structures. The structure of the ring-like structures is similar to that found in a flat sheet. However, it is not clear how the rings of ArP2-3 are able to organize themselves into such a tight structure. To investigate this question, Almeida-Souza et al. used a technique called cryo-electron tomography to count the number of active proteins in human cells that assemble at the site of clathrin-mediated endoosis. Using this method, the researchers found that ~200 activated proteins are required to build a ring around the center of each ring, and that around 200 of them are active in this ring. Further experiments showed that, in response to high levels of chemical stress, these proteins bend and bend to produce more force. Together these findings show that a minimal ring of acti networks is sufficient to make the membrane flexible enough to withstand the stresses of cell migration. In the future, this work could be applied to a wide range of cellular processes, from cytokinesis and cell migrations, to cytokine production and trafficking."

During macropinocytosis , a protein called actin \u2013 which provides structural support to cells \u2013 drives the formation of cup-shaped structures from the membrane that surrounds the cell . Several signaling molecules control when and where the \u201ccups\u201d form , but it was not known exactly how the different types of molecules work together .

The experiments revealed that to make a cup , the actin first arranges to form a ring . The ring copies a template in the membrane , which consists of high concentrations of signaling molecules , and then extends outward to form a hollow cup by which fluid is taken up . The most important signaling molecule identified in these patches of membrane is a protein called Ras , which is mutated and hyperactive in many different types of cancer . In Dictyostelium cells that have a genetic mutation that makes Ras more active , the patches of signaling molecules and macropinocytic cups were larger than in normal cells . The findings of Veltman et al . provide new details about how cells engulf fluids from their surroundings . The next steps will be to investigate how the signaling molecules form patches in the first place , and how they attract actin molecules .

However, it is not well understood how the formation of macropinoomes in cells is controlled. To find out, Bloomfield, Swanson et al. used a technique called lattice light sheet microscopy to study the shape and activity of cells in Dictyostelium, a bacterium that is thought to be involved in cancer. The experiments show that when the cells divide, they form a large cup shaped like a ruffle. These cups form by splitting from existing ones and forming a new cup-shaped ring around the ring. In addition to forming the new cups, this ring also helps to recruit a group of other proteins, including active Ras and active Rasp, to form the rings. When these proteins are mutated, these rings form into a \u2018crown\u2019 that surrounds the cup and surrounds it. As a result, the cups can grow in size, but they do not form in a circular fashion. Instead, when Ras is mutated and Ras becomes active, Ras forms a patch on the outer membrane that encloses the inner ring and forms the final cup.

Defects in this process result in severe developmental abnormalities . Moreover , the genes that underlie this process are among the most frequently mutated in cancer . Cohesin is enriched at centromeres: the chromosomal points of attachment to the apparatus ( called the \u2018mitotic spindle\u2019 ) that segregates the sister chromatids into the daughter cells . The protein complex that loads cohesin onto chromosomes determines this preferential localization . The two components of the loading complex , Scc2 and Scc4 , associate as a 1:1 pair . Hinshaw et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of Scc4 bound with a large fragment of Scc2 . The result showed that the elongated Scc4 twists around the fragment of Scc2 , forming an extended groove . Scc2 snakes through the Scc4 groove and emerges at both ends . Hinshaw et al . then performed a series of experiments in yeast cells to probe how Scc4 determines the location at which cohesin loads onto chromosomes . These experiments revealed that a region on the surface of Scc4 targets both Scc4 and Scc2 to centromeres . The amino-acid sequence of this centromere-targeting patch on the surface of Scc4 is conserved across species . Thus , the mechanism by which Scc4 localizes cohesin to centromeres may be similar in all eukaryotic organisms .",

When a cell divides into two, the two copies of the same gene are separated by a process called anaphase. This process is called cohesination, and it is important for the cell to divide correctly. However, when a gene is mutated, it can lead to a severe developmental disorder called Cornelia de Lange Syndrome ( CDLS ). The disease is caused by the loss of a protein called Scc2NIPBL ( SCC2/4Mau2 ) in yeast cells.

Now, Murayama et al. have used a technique called TPR to study the interaction between two proteins in budding yeast. They found that a patch on the surface of one of these proteins is required to bind to the protein. In the experiments, this patch was found to be a conserved patch that envelops a group of proteins that are known to play a key role in cohesion. Further experiments showed that the patch also encodes an array of other proteins. These proteins are also found in other eukaryotes, including yeasts and metazoans.

However they are now largely confined to western Europe with north-eastern and eastern populations having become scattered and fragmented . During the course of a year in northern and central Europe , they make the most of the warm season to fatten up and to produce up to two litters of youngsters . When winter comes , dormice enter hibernation , sometimes for more than six months . During this time , they must rely on their fat reserves to survive . Every year , the young from the second litter have less time to prepare for the winter compared to their siblings born earlier in the season . So , how do they still manage to get ready on time for hibernation ? Here , Mahlert et al . studied captive pups from first and second litters for their first year , following them as they grew up , entered and then emerged from their first hibernation . The late-born individuals developed nearly twice as fast as the ones born early in the season . In fact , both reached a similar body size , but the second-litter dormice had less fat reserves . Just before their first winter , both early- and late-born animals increasingly started to enter torpor \u2013 short and daily resting-like periods when the body slows down . Torpor rarely happens when animals are growing ( because growth requires a warm body ) , but it is useful to help storing and consolidating fat before the cold months . Late-born dormice experienced more torpor on average than their first-litter peers . Both groups survived their first hibernation; but when they emerged , late-born individuals were more likely to reproduce that year . In other words , the dormice which grew quickly might also have sexually matured earlier . This could suggest that animals born later in the season have a faster life history: they grow rapidly , reproduce quickly but may die younger than their early-born peers . Mahlert et al . highlighted how early-life events can shape the course of animals\u2019 existences and influence how their bodies operate . It remains to be examined how these circumstances may affect the individuals in the longer term , and perhaps even their descendants .",

The experiments show that, during the first few weeks of winter, the larvae grow and fatten faster than those born later in winter. In the spring, these larvae use the energy stored by the placenta as their primary source of energy. During this time, they use this energy to increase their growth rate, fattening, and increase the amount of fat stored in their bodies. Further experiments showed that the same patterns of growth were observed in both the early and later stages of larval growth. These findings suggest that early larvae are more likely to be born in late winter than later larvae. Furthermore, late larvae grew faster and gained more fat during their winter survival and reproduction. Moreover, when they were born at the end of their reproductive year, LB larvae gained mass at an even higher rate than EB larvae, but did not grow as fast as EB juveniles. Overall, this study suggests that this may be a response to the lack of food resources and the need for energy storage. Future studies are also needed to determine if other strategies may also be used to cope with this problem."

To make a protein , a section of DNA known as a gene is used as a template to make molecules known as messenger ribonucleic acids ( or mRNAs for short ) . The message in RNA consists of a series of individual letters , known as nucleotides , that tell the cell how much of a protein should be produced ( referred to as gene expression ) as well as the specific activities of each protein . The letters in mRNAs can be changed in specific cells and at certain points in development through a process known as RNA editing . This process is essential for animals to grow and develop normally and for the brain to work properly . Errors in RNA editing are found in patients suffering from a variety of neuropathological diseases , including Alzheimer\u2019s disease , depression and brain tumors . Humans have millions of editing sites that are predicted to affect gene expression . However , many studies of RNA editing have only focused on the changes that alter protein activity . The ADAR proteins carry out a specific type of RNA editing in animals . In a microscopic worm known as Caenorhabditis elegans the loss of an ADAR protein called ADR-2 reduces the ability of the worm to move in response to chemicals , a process known as chemotaxis . Deffit et al . found that loss of ADR-2 affected the expression of over 150 genes in the nervous system of the worm . To identify which letters in the mRNAs were edited in the nervous system , Deffit et al . developed a new publically available software program called SAILOR ( software for accurately identifying locations of RNA editing ) . This program can be used to detect RNA editing in any cell , tissue or organism . By combining the experimental and computational approaches , Deffit et al . were able to identify a gene that was edited in normal worms and expressed at lower levels in the mutant worms . Increasing the expression of just this one of gene in the mutant worms restored the worms\u2019 ability to move towards a chemical \u201cscent\u201d . Together , these findings suggest that when studying human neuropathological diseases we should consider the effect of RNA editing on the amount of gene expression as well as protein activity . Future work should investigate the importance of RNA editing in controlling gene expression in other diseases including cancers .",

However, it is not clear exactly how these gene editing enzymes work. To investigate this question, Wessels et al. used a technique called RNA-to-I editing to identify the genes that are involved in controlling gene expression in worms. The experiments revealed that worms lacking the gene that codes for the enzyme ADR-2 can have a neurological disorder called chemotaxis. This disorder is caused by the loss of the ability of a gene to bind to a target RNA molecule, called an inosine ( I ) molecule. It is thought that this editing process alters the expression of genes, but it was not known how it works. Instead, the experiments identified 7361 genes in C. elegans, a type of worm that is normally found in all living organisms. These genes were edited to make a protein called clec-41, and the worms were then exposed to chemomechanical disruption to see if they had any of these editing sites. In the end, these worms had a reduced ability to communicate with each other and were less able to move around in their environment. Further work is now needed to understand how this process works in other organisms, including humans."

These proteins are constantly being built according to accurate instructions , which are encoded on molecules named messenger RNAs ( mRNAs for short ) . The process of converting the instructions into proteins is called translation . Viruses infect host cells and take over the cellular machinery that is responsible for translation . This causes the cell to produce viral proteins at the expense of host proteins \u2013 a process called host shutoff . As a result , viral proteins take over the cell and the infection accelerates . There are two main strategies used by viruses to co-opt the cell\u2019s translation machinery: either host mRNAs are destroyed , or the machines that read mRNA molecules are manipulated to read only the viral instructions . Most viruses appear to dedicate themselves to using just one of these strategies . However , evidence suggests that the Influenza A virus uses both strategies to induce host shutoff . To investigate the extent to which each of the shutoff strategies is used by the Influenza A virus , Bercovich-Kinori , Tai et al . have studied infected human lung cells . This revealed that the virus primarily reduces the amount of host mRNA in the cells to take over the mRNA pool . The host mRNAs were affected by the infection to different extents . For example , the mRNAs that coded for proteins that perform important roles for the virus , such as produce energy , were not affected by the virus . A future challenge is to find out exactly how the Influenza A virus distinguishes between different cellular mRNAs . This knowledge may help to develop new treatments for flu .",
        "first_gen": "Influenza A viruses ( or IAVs for short ) cause an infectious disease that affects millions of people worldwide. These viruses use a common strategy called host shutoff to prevent the production of viral proteins. This strategy is known as \u201ccap-snatching\u201d, and is used by many viruses to stop the translation of the viral mRNA into proteins that are needed for the cell\u2019s protein synthesis machinery. However, it is not clear exactly how this mechanism works. Now, Ingolia et al. have used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms that enable the IA virus to shut off its host mRNA. The experiments show that the virus uses a combination of two complementary mechanisms: direct translation co-opting and host RNA degradation. First, the viruses cleave the RNA molecules that bind to the mRNA molecules. Second, viral RNA is degraded by a process called oxidative phosphorylation. In the experiments, a group of cells that had been infected with the influenza A virus were genetically engineered so that they could be used as a model organism to study the role of viruses in cell production. When the cells were pre-treated with a drug called harringtonine, they were less likely to be able to produce the proteins they needed to make. Further experiments revealed that viruses that do not have a cap on their mRNA mRNA are less affected by the flu virus than those that lack one. Moreover, viruses with short mRNA transcripts are much less susceptible to infection by flu viruses, suggesting that this is due to a mechanism that prevents them from making the protein they need to multiply. Overall, these findings suggest that host-mediated viral shut-off is an important public health problem."

        "ground_truth": "When an embryo develops , its cells must work together and \u2018talk\u2019 with each other so they can build the tissues and organs of the body . A cell can communicate with its neighbors by producing a signal , also known as a morphogen , which will tell the receiving cells what to do . Once outside the cell , a morphogen spreads through the surrounding tissue and forms a gradient: there is more of the molecule closer to the signaling cells and less further away . The cells that receive the message respond differently depending on how much morphogen they get , and therefore on where they are placed in the embryo . How morphogens move in tissues to create gradients is still poorly understood . One hypothesis is that , once released , they spread passively through the space between cells . Instead , recent research has shown that some morphogens travel through long , thin cellular extensions known as cytonemes . These structures directly connect the cells that produce a morphogen with the ones that receive the molecule . Yet , it is still unclear how cytonemes can help to form gradients . Du et al . aimed to resolve this question by following a morphogen called Branchless as it traveled through fruit fly embryos . Branchless is important for sculpting the embryonic airway tissue into a delicate network of branched tubes which supply oxygen to the cells of an adult fly . However , no one knew how cells communicate Branchless , whether or not Branchless formed a gradient , and if it did , how this gradient was created to set up the plan to form airway tubes . It was assumed that the molecule would diffuse passively to reach airway cells \u2013 but this is not what the experiments by Du et al . showed . To directly observe how Branchless moves among cells , insects were genetically engineered to produce Branchless molecules attached to a fluorescent \u2018tag\u2019 . Microscopy experiments using these flies revealed that Branchless did not diffuse passively; instead , airway cells used cytonemes to \u2018reach\u2019 towards the cells that produced the molecule , collecting the signal directly from its source . The gradient was created because the airway cells near the cells that make Branchless had more cytonemes , and therefore received more of the molecule compared to the cells that were placed further away . Genetic analysis of the airway tissue showed that Branchless acts as a morphogen to switch on different genes in the receiving cells placed in different locations . The target genes activated by the gradient instruct the receiving cells on how many cytonemes need to be extended , which helps the gradient to maintain itself over time . Du et al . demonstrate for the first time how cytonemes can relay a signal to establish a gradient in a developing tissue . Dissecting how cells exchange information to create an organism could help to understand how this communication fails and leads to disorders .",
        "first_gen": "When a cell divides, it sends signals to another cell in the cell\u2019s environment. These signals then move to the recipient cell, where they interact with each other to form a gradient. This gradient is known as a \u201cgradient\u201d, and it has been proposed that the gradient forms in a large population of cells. However, the exact details of how these gradients form are not fully understood. For example, how a signaling protein called FGF moves from producing cells to receiving cells is not well understood, but it is thought that it helps to control the distribution of the signals. Now, Du et al. have used live imaging technology to study the movement of a fluorescently-tagged signal protein, called Fibroblast Growth Factor \u03b2 ( FGFR for short ), in fruit flies. The experiments revealed that a gene that is expressed in fibroblasts called cytonemes is responsible for the formation of gradient shapes and contours. In the larvae of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, this gene is present in many types of tissue, including the wing-disc and the air-sac-primordium. Importantly, these cells also express a receptor called Breathless, which is essential for cell-to-cell communication. Further experiments showed that this receptor is active in both the developing and developing tissues. Moreover, when the cells are separated from the source, they are able to switch on the expression of two other signaling proteins called Pointed-P1 at higher levels and Cut at lower levels. Together these findings reveal a new mechanism by which the flow of signals through the tissues is dynamically modulated to create gradient shape and shape. Future work will be needed to understand how this process works in more detail."

Groups of amino acids within the protein can then fold into three-dimensional shapes , one of the most common being a helical structure known as an \u03b1-helix . Two or more \u03b1-helices may be wound around each other to form a bundle called a coiled coil , which is found in many proteins . Each complete turn of an \u03b1-helix contains a set number of amino acids , but the number of amino acids in the turns of a coiled coil can vary . The most common pattern in a coiled coil has 7 amino acids over two turns , which is known as a heptad repeat . When amino acids are added into or deleted from the heptad repeats , the number of amino acids in the turns of a coiled coil changes . However , it cannot increase too far beyond the number of amino acids in each turn of a normal \u03b1-helix because there is a limit to the amount of coiling that the helices can tolerate . Many naturally occurring coiled coils have regions where the overall \u03b1-helical structure is retained , even though there are small sections where the number of amino acids in a turn is disrupted . This may be due to insertions of small numbers of amino acids . Although the impact of some insertions ( e . g . three or four at a time ) has been studied , the effect of inserting other amounts of amino acids was not clear . Hartmann et al . investigated what would happen when two or six amino acids were inserted into the heptad repeats of a coiled coil within a protein from bacteria . These numbers of amino acids have been predicted to cause the greatest strain on the coiled coil structure . The experiments show that inserting these numbers of amino acids caused so much strain that the three \u03b1-helices making up the coiled coil break apart and refold into a completely different type of structure called a \u03b2-strand . The three short \u03b2-strands then associate into a triangular structure that Hartmann et al . named a \u03b2-layer . Further experiments showed that inserting the same numbers of amino acids into the heptad repeats of other coiled coil proteins also resulted in the formation of \u03b2-layers . Hartmann et al . \u2019s findings suggest that the alternating \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-strand structures may help to make the proteins stronger and enable to carry out more versatile roles in cells .",

They consist of two \u03b1-helices, wound into superhelical bundles and held together by a core that is hydrophobic. The coiled coil is the first protein domain to be described in atomic detail, and it is also the only one whose backbone structure can be computed with parametric equations. However, it has been difficult to understand the structure of these coils because they are so complex. To understand how they work, Hartmann et al. used a technique called \u201ccoiled-coil theory\u201d to create a structure that mimics the shape of a protein coil. This revealed that two or six residues are inserted into the underlying heptad repeat to form a \u2018stranded\u2019 structure. These insertions are then used to make a new type of protein, called \u03b1/\u03b2, which is able to move the path of its chain by 120\u00b0 around the trimer axis. In addition, the insertion of six or seven residues into this structure causes the protein to break down, leading to the formation of short \u03b2-strands that move along the hemispheres of this protein. It is not clear how this new structure is possible in the Ramachandran space, but it appears that it could be possible within the allowed regions of that space with only minor mutations to a known protein fold."

        "ground_truth": "Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is one of the mechanisms used by cells to internalize specific proteins ( cargo ) from their surface . First , the cargo interacts with adaptor proteins that help cluster them in the cell's outer membrane , called the plasma membrane . This causes the protein clathrin to assemble into a lattice at the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane and deform the membrane into a pit . The pit grows deeper over time as more clathrin molecules assemble , eventually resulting in a deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pit that encloses the cargo to be taken up by the cell . The clathrin-coated pit then pinches off inside the cell in a process called fission to form a bubble-like structure called a vesicle , which transports the molecule to its destination . The deep invagination of clathrin-coated pits that leads to fission is assisted by actin , a protein that assembles into filaments that are suggested to generate the forces needed for this process . Many other factors are also involved . One of them is epsin , the collective name for a family of three very similar proteins in mammalian cells . Epsin binds to several other proteins implicated in clathrin-dependent endocytosis , including clathrin itself , and to plasma membrane proteins specifically \u2018tagged\u2019 for internalization . In addition , a portion of the epsin molecule can insert into the plasma membrane and help it to curve , which is important for forming the invaginated pit . However , due to the number of possible functions epsin could perform , its main role has remained elusive . Messa et al . created mouse cells that lack all three epsin proteins . Although these cells can form clathrin-coated pits , they struggle to develop into vesicles . The normal linking of the actin filaments to the clathrin coat does not occur , and another protein called Hip1R that also participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and links clathrin to actin , no longer accumulates at the clathrin-coated pits . Messa et al . also find that epsins can bind directly to actin . Overall , these results suggest that a main role of epsin is to help actin interact with the clathrin-coated pits and generate the force required for a pit to develop into a vesicle . However , epsin also performs many other roles , including recruiting a membrane protein ( a so-called SNARE ) that directs the fate of the vesicle to the clathrin-coated pit . Additionally , Messa et al . find that cells lacking all three epsins have problems dividing correctly . More research is required to establish whether this effect is also due to epsin's interaction with the cell's actin cytoskeleton .",
        "first_gen": "Clathrin is one of the most important proteins in the cell, and it is thought to play an important role in many processes. However, the exact role of epsin in this process remains unclear. It is known that it binds to a protein called Eps15, which is found in mammals, but it has not been shown to be involved in endocytosis. Instead, it was thought that the protein is responsible for the formation of pits and fission of clathrins. This is because Epsin is made up of three groups of proteins. One of these groups is called the \u2018superior\u2019 group, while the other two groups are known as the super-complex group. The supercomplex consists of a helix at the N-terminus that is folded into an amphipathic shape and the actin cytoskeleton. These two proteins interact with each other to form a protective coat that protects the cells from damage caused by a chemical called 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen ( or SNARE for short ). SnAREs are proteins that bind to other proteins and are important for cell division. Now, Skruzny et al. have used a technique called triple KO to genetically engineer mice to produce mutant mice that lacked the ability to divide. In the experiments, these mice were genetically engineered to lack the three-dimensional structure that makes up the outer layer of their cell. When the mutant cells were grown in a laboratory, they were unable to differentiate between the two types of cells. Further experiments showed that this defect was due to the loss of one gene that encodes the enzyme that codes for a molecule called SNAR ( short for \u201csnake-like\u201d ) and a low affinity interaction with another gene called EPSIN. As a result, this gene was no longer able to generate the force needed to break down the membrane and form pits. Furthermore, when the mice developed a defect in their development, their cells developed into pits that were much larger than normal. A further challenge will be to find out why this is the case in humans."

To investigate this question, Nkurunungi et al. used a case-control study to identify the main risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren in Uganda and other low-income countries ( LMICs ). The study involved 555 cases and 1115 controls. These children lived in a small town or in an urban area, but their parents were more likely to have asthma than their children\u2019s parents. This suggests that there are a number of environmental and lifestyle factors that may contribute to asthma risk. For example, the parents of children who had asthma had higher levels of alcohol and tobacco smoke than those who did not have alcohol or tobacco smoking. Further investigation revealed that asthma was associated with a strong rural-town-city risk gradient, higher parental socio-economic status and urbanicity. Moreover, there was also an increase in exposure to a chemical called nitric oxide, which is found in plants and animals that are polluting the air. Together, these findings suggest that environmental factors may play an important role in increasing the likelihood that children with asthma will develop asthma later in life. Future studies are also needed to investigate the impact of other factors, such as the environment in which the children live."

As a result , there is considerable interest in understanding how genes , proteins , and cells work together to produce the many different pigmentation patterns that exist in the animal world . Adult zebrafish have a characteristic pigmentation pattern of horizontal dark and light stripes on their bodies and fins . There are three types of pigment cell that create this pattern . Xanthophores and iridophores are found all over the body , and the dark stripes also contain melanophore cells . The silvery , reflective iridophores are the first of the cells to populate the skin , giving rise to the first light stripe . They then form a dense network of cells that breaks up to form the darker stripes . However , iridophores are not required to form stripes in the fins , suggesting that patterning occurs differently in the fins and the body . Mutations to a gene called leopard , or leo for short , cause spots to form on the skin of the zebrafish in place of the usual stripes . This gene encodes a member of the connexin family of proteins , which form channels in the membranes that surround cells . These channels\u2014known as gap junctions\u2014allow neighbouring cells to communicate with each other . Each gap junction is made up of two half channels , with one half coming from each neighbouring cells . If the two half channels are identical , the gap junction is known as \u2018homomeric\u2019; \u2018heteromeric\u2019 gap junctions are made from two different half channels , each consisting of a different connexin protein . The connexin encoded by leo is required for both types of gap junction to form between melanophores and xanthophores . Irion et al . discovered a new mutation to the leo gene that completely disrupts the patterning of the zebrafish . A technique called a genetic screen revealed that the same patterning defects are also seen in the body of zebrafish with mutations to another gene called luchs , which encodes a different connexin protein to the one produced by leo . However , the fins of zebrafish with mutant versions of luchs remain striped . The findings of Irion et al . suggest that heteromeric gap junctions formed from the connexins produced by leo and luchs are important for xanthophores and melanophores to communicate with each other and so form the stripy patterning seen on the body of the zebrafish . The signals transmitted through the gap junctions may also make the iridophores adopt the looser arrangement that is required for the dark stripes to form . As a next step , it will be important to identify the signals that pass through these gap junctions that allow the cells to communicate with their neighbours and establish the pigmentation pattern .",
        "first_gen": "The stripes on the trunk of an adult zebrafish are made up of three types of cells called chromatophores, which are responsible for the patterning of the stripes. These cells are also involved in the formation of light and dark stripes, and they are required to form the stripe pattern. However, it is not clear how these cells work together to create these patterns. A gene called Connexin 41. 8 ( Cx41. 4 ) is required for this pattern to be formed. This gene encodes a type of pigment cell called a gap junction subunit. The gap junctions are found in both the body and the tail of a fish, but it was not known how they work. Now, Singh et al. have identified three different variants of this gene in adult leopard ( Danio rerio ) that cause a pattern of dark and light stripes to appear on their bodies and tailfins. One of these variants is known as luchs. In the mutant version of leo, the gaps between the two pigment cells form a series of irregular patterns that are not seen in other species of fish. Further experiments have shown that the cells that make these gaps form heteromeric gaps, while the other two types are only required in iridophore cells and not in leotK3 cells. When these two cell types were not present in these mutant animals, they formed an irregular pattern that was almost identical to the one that had been observed in wild-type leopards. But in mutant fish with the same mutation, these stripes did not form at all. Instead, a new gene that codes for Luchs was found to have a dominant negative effect on this particular cell type. As a result, this new mutation caused the striped patterns to become irregular, suggesting that this is due to a lack of interconnections between these three pigments. More studies are now needed to find out how this occurs."

Members of one of these receptor families , the olfactory receptors , form a complex with another protein , the olfactory coreceptor that is essential for both positioning and stabilizing the receptor , as well as the actual function . Crustaceans share a common ancestor with insects , and since they do not have olfactory receptors it has been proposed that these receptors evolved when prehistoric insects moved from the sea to live on land . According to this idea , olfactory receptors evolved because these ancestors needed to be able to detect odor molecules floating in the air rather than dissolved in water . Previous research on insect olfactory receptors has focused on insects with wings . Missbach et al . have now used a wide range of techniques to investigate how evolutionarily older wingless insect groups detect scents . As all investigated groups evolved from a common ancestor at different times these experiments allow tracking of the historical development of olfactory receptors . In the wingless species that is more closely related to the flying insects there was evidence of the presence of multiple coreceptors but not the olfactory receptors themselves . In the most basal insects no evidence for any part of the olfactory receptor-based system was found . This indicates that the main olfactory receptors evolved independently of the coreceptor long after the migration of insects from water to land .

To investigate this question, Missbach et al. looked at the genes that are involved in detecting volatile chemicals and found three species of insect called Lepismachilis y-signata, Thermobia domestica and Phyllium siccifolium. These insects are the closest relatives of all living animals and have evolved from an aquatic ancestor, probably around 483 mya ( the Early Ordovician ). Insects detect volatile molecules by detecting them using a combination of ionotropic receptors ( or ORs for short ) and gustatory receptors, which are also found in leaf and stick insects. The results of this study suggest that the evolution of these receptor families evolved later in insect evolution, before the emergence of leaf or stick insect species. In addition, the results show that insects evolved a more complex system of receptors that could detect the odor of volatile compounds. This suggests that insect receptors did not evolve as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. Instead, they evolved as a response to the presence of other odor-specific receptors. Further work is now needed to determine how the insect receptor family evolved."

The analysis looked at malaria infections among residents of four villages in the Kayin State of Myanmar that used mass antimalarial drug administration . People who lived in neighborhoods with high participation in mass drug administration were almost three times less likely to get malaria than people who lived in communities with low participation .

Some differences between animal species are due to them having different genes: stretches of DNA that contain the instructions to make proteins and other molecules .

The instructions that control when and where a gene is expressed are written in the sequence of DNA bases located in the regulatory region of the gene . These instructions are written in a language that is often called the \u2018gene regulatory code\u2019 . This code is read and interpreted by proteins called transcription factors that bind to specific sequences of DNA ( or \u2018DNA words\u2019 ) and increase or decrease gene expression . Changes in gene expression between species could therefore be due to changes in the transcription factors and/or changes in the instructions within the regulatory regions of specific genes . Gene regulatory regions are not well conserved between species . However , it is unclear if the instructions in these regions are written using the same gene regulatory code , and whether transcription factors found in different species recognize different DNA words . Nitta et al . have now used high-throughput methods to identify the DNA words recognized by 242 transcription factors from a fruit fly called Drosophila melanogaster . Nitta et al . then used new computational tools to find motifs , or collections of DNA words , that are recognized by each of the transcription factors . By comparing the motifs , they observed that , in spite of more than 600 million years of evolution , almost all known motifs found in humans and mice were recognized by fruit fly transcription factors . Nitta et al . noted that both fruit flies and humans have transcription factors that recognize a few unique motifs , and confer properties that are specific to each species . For example , some of the transcription factors that control the development of the fruit fly wing are not present in humans . Moreover , fruit flies lack both mucus-producing goblet cells and the ability to recognize a motif read by the transcription factor that controls the development of these cells in humans . The findings of Nitta et al . also indicate that transcription factors do not evolve to recognize subtly different DNA motifs , but instead appear constrained to recognize the same motifs . Thus , much like the genetic code that instructs how to build proteins , the gene regulatory code that determines how DNA sequences direct gene expression is also highly conserved in animals . The language used to guide the development of animals has , as such , remained very similar for millions of years . What makes animals different is differences in the content and length of the instructions that are written using this language into the regulatory regions of their genes .",

Many of these proteins have specific roles, such as binding to specific sites on the DNA, which are known as \u201cbinding specificities\u201d. However, it is not clear how the evolutionary divergence between vertebrates and invertebrates has led to the emergence of new types of cells. To investigate this, Jolma et al. used a technique called HT-SELEX to compare the binding specificity of 242 proteins from different species of fruit fly. The experiments revealed that, unlike humans, fruit flies do not have a particular binding specificity. Instead, many of the proteins are expressed in different ways, and some of them are very similar to those found in humans and other animals. This suggests that the differences between the two species may be due to differences in how DNA is bound to proteins. In addition, the experiments also showed that some proteins that are more specific to one type of protein, called transcription factors ( TFs ), are highly conserved between mammals and birds. These findings suggest that evolution of TF proteins may have influenced the development of many new cell types, including new cells that can be differentiated from other species."

These early stages of development are known as embryogenesis \u2013 a tightly organized process , during which the embryo forms different layers of stem cells . These cells can be activated to turn into a particular type of cell , such as a heart or a lung cell . The heart and lungs develop from different layers within the embryo , which must communicate with each other for the organs to form correctly . For example , chemical signals can be released from and travel between layers of the embryo , activating processes inside cells located in the different areas . In mouse models , chemical signals and cells travel between developing heart and lung , which helps both organs to form into the correct structure . But it is unclear how well the observations from mouse models translate to heart and lung development in humans . To find out more , Ng et al . developed a human model of heart and lung co-development during embryogenesis using human pluripotent stem cells . The laboratory-grown stem cells were treated with chemical signals , causing them to form different layers that developed into early forms of heart and lung cells . The cells were then transferred into a specific growing condition , where they arranged into three-dimensional structures termed microtissues . Ng et al . found that lung cells developed faster when grown in microtissues with accompanying developing heart cells compared to microtissues containing only developing lung cells . In addition , Ng et al . revealed that the co-developing heart and lung tissues automatically separate from each other during later stage , without the need for chemical signals . This human cell-based model of early forms of co-developing heart and lung cells may help provide researchers with new strategies to probe the underlying mechanisms of human heart and lung interaction during embryogenesis .",
        "first_gen": "The heart and the lung are the two main organs in the chest cavity. Together, these organs are responsible for the development of the body\u2019s tissues and organs. The heart is the main organ, while the lungs and endoderm contribute to the heart. However, it is not clear how these two organs coordinate their development. To investigate this question, Chen et al. used a technique called 3D suspension culture to create a single culture of human embryonic stem cells. This allowed the cells to be differentiated into two different types of cells, each containing a different type of tissue. These cells were then grown in a laboratory environment and then genetically modified to produce a new form of stem cell called a human-induced pluripotent stem ( hiPSC for short ). When this process took place, the embryos were able to develop into both heart- and lung-derived cells with the help of a small molecule called WNT agonist. In the absence of any new growth factors, this resulted in both cells becoming the same size and shape, which is essential for their proper development and maturation. Chen and co-workers then developed a stepwise strategy to ensure that both of these cells could be distinguished from each other, and that they could then be switched on and off during the embryonic development process. By using a series of small molecules that selectively switched off the activity of both the cardiac and pulmonary progenitor cells in this step-wise process, researchers could now investigate the relationship between the embryo and its own tissues."

        "ground_truth": "A cell\u2019s DNA can acquire errors over the course of its lifetime . These errors , known as mutations , are often harmful and can cripple the cell . However , some mutations are needed to enable a cell or organism to adapt to changes in its environment . Since there is a trade-off between acquiring beneficial mutations versus harmful ones , cells carefully balance how often they acquire new mutations . Cells have several mechanisms that limit the number of mutations by correcting errors in DNA . Occasionally these repair mechanisms may fail so that a small number of cells in a population accumulate mutations more quickly than other cells . This process is known as \u201chypermutation\u201d and it enables some cells to rapidly adapt to changing conditions in order to avoid the entire population from becoming extinct . So far , studies on hypermutation have largely been carried out under conditions that are mildly stressful to the cells , which only cause low frequency of hypermutation . However , little is known about the role of this process in cells under near-lethal levels of stress , for example , when drugs target bacteria or cancer cells in the human body . Swings et al . studied hypermutation in populations of a bacterium called Escherichia coli exposed to levels of alcohol that cause the bacteria to experience extreme stress . The experiments show that hypermutation occurs rapidly in these conditions and is essential for bacteria to adapt to the level of alcohol and avoid extinction . Populations of bacteria in which hypermutation did not occur were unable to develop tolerance to the alcohol and perished . Further experiments show that an individual population of bacteria can alter the rate of mutation ( that is , how often new mutations arise ) several times as a result of changing stress levels . The findings of Swings et al . suggest that hypermutation can rapidly arise in populations of cells that are experiencing extreme stress . Therefore , this process may pose a serious risk in the development of drug resistant bacteria and cancer cells . In the future , developing new drugs that target hypermutation may help to fight bacterial infections and cancer .",
        "first_gen": "Mutations are necessary for an organism to survive in stressful environments. For example, if a cell is exposed to high levels of ethanol, it can only survive for a few generations. However, mutations can also be beneficial if the cell adapts to changes in the environment. This is the case for many organisms, such as bacteria, viruses and bacteria. Mutations can be harmful to the organism\u2019s DNA, but they are also beneficial to its survival. In fact, the rate of mutation in a bacterium called Salmonella is so high that it has been suggested that the mutation rate may be limited in time. But it is not clear how mutations are able to adapt to stress. Now, Voordeckers et al. have used bacteria grown under optimal conditions as a model system to study the evolution of mutations. The experiments show that different strains of bacteria grow under different conditions, including high ethanol concentrations, and that they can adapt quickly to these conditions. Further experiments showed that mutations in different bacteria can rapidly increase in frequency when cells experience higher ethanol levels. Moreover, when the bacteria are adapted to a high level of stress, they increase their mutation rates and decrease their survival rate. These findings suggest that, in some situations, a mutation is necessary to ensure that a population can survive and survive under high concentrations of the high-end ethanol. Furthermore, this flexibility allows the cells to evolve faster and more efficiently, which helps explain why some organisms are prone to hypermutation. Overall, these findings shed new light on the dynamics of evolution and may help explain the prevalence of hypermutators in clinical settings."

In plants , an enzyme called SnRK1 plays a crucial role in responses to starvation in two ways: by altering the activities of enzymes involved in metabolism and by regulating the expression of genes . To perform the second job , SnRK1 is thought to control the activity of proteins called transcription factors\u2014which alter the expression of genes by binding to DNA\u2014but it is not known which ones . SnRK1 has \u2018kinase\u2019 activity , that is , it can alter the activities of other proteins by adding small molecules called phosphates to them . It has been suggested that a group of transcription factors called the bZIP proteins may be regulated by SnRK1 . Two bZIP proteins work together to switch on a gene , and the combination of bZIP proteins that interact can influence which genes are switched on . Here , Mair et al . studied the role of a bZIP protein called bZIP63 during starvation in the plant Arabidopsis . The experiments show that bZIP63 is involved in controlling responses to starvation . Furthermore , its activity is regulated by SnRK1 , which adds phosphates to three specific locations on the protein . These phosphates alter the ability of bZIP63 to interact with other bZIP proteins , leading to changes in gene expression during starvation . Mair et al . triggered starvation in Arabidopsis plants by keeping the plants in darkness for several days . The leaves of normal plants turn yellow in response to starvation , but the leaves of mutant plants that lacked bZIP63 remained green . In contrast , plants containing higher amounts of this bZIP protein showed the opposite effect and their leaves turned yellow much more quickly than normal plants . The mutant plants that lacked bZIP63 could be rescued by the normal protein , but not by another version of the protein that SnRK1 is unable to add phosphates to . These data suggest that SnRK1 regulates bZIP63 activity to alter metabolism in response to starvation . Mair et al . propose a model in which the ability of bZIP63 to interact with other bZIPs is normally rather low . However , when the plants are starved , SnRK1 adds phosphates to bZIP63 , which increases its ability to bind to other bZIP proteins and leads to changes in gene expression . The bZIP proteins are also found in animals; therefore a future challenge is to find out whether these proteins are also regulated in a similar way .",

Plants, for example, have a protein called SNRK1, which regulates the activity of a number of enzymes, including a transcription factor called AMPK. These enzymes are also involved in the metabolism of other organisms, such as animals, plants and mammals. In plants, the gene for a gene that codes for the protein for protein kinase 1 is regulated in two ways: by a process called reversible phosphorylation, and by massive transcriptional reprogramming. However, it is not clear how this process works in animals and plants. To investigate this question, Matiolli et al. genetically engineered Arabidopsis thaliana plants to be able to switch from fermentative to oxidative metabolism. The experiments showed that the enzyme was activated when the plant was exposed to a chemical called bZIP63, a type of sugar that is found in many animals. Further experiments revealed that this protein was also activated under conditions that were similar to starvation, but not at the same level. This suggests that a specific protein is responsible for this switch in metabolism and that it may also play an important role in regulating the production of sugars and other energy-consuming molecules. Matisollis, Veerabagu and Tome have now identified a new protein that plays a similar role as the one that controls the sugar response in plant cells. It is also unclear whether the changes in gene expression in plants are caused by the addition of glucose or by other factors."

This process takes place at the junctions between neurons , which are known as synapses , and typically involves one of the cells releasing a chemical messenger that binds to receptors on the other cell . The binding triggers a cascade of events inside the recipient cell , including the production of new receptors and their insertion into the cell membrane . These changes strengthen the synapse and are thought to be one of the ways in which the brain establishes and maintains memories . However , in order to induce these changes at the synapse , neurons must be able to activate the genes that encode their component parts . These genes are present inside the cell nucleus , which is located some distance away from the synapse . Studies have shown that signals can be sent from the nucleus to the synapse and vice versa , enabling the two parts of the cell to exchange information . Synapses that communicate using a chemical called glutamate have been particularly well studied; but it still remains unclear how the activation of receptors at these \u201cglutamatergic synapses\u201d is linked to activation of genes inside the nucleus at the molecular level . Dinamarca , Guzzetti et al . have now discovered that this process at glutamatergic synapses involves the movement of a protein messenger to the nucleus . Specifically , activation at synapses of a particularly common subtype of receptor , called NMDA , causes a protein called Ring Finger protein 10 ( or RNF10 for short ) to move from the synapse to the nucleus . To leave the synapse , RNF10 first has to bind to proteins called importins , which transport RNF10 into the nucleus . Once inside the nucleus , RNF10 binds to another protein that interacts with the DNA to start the production of new synaptic proteins . Further work is required to identify the molecular mechanisms that trigger RNF10 to leave the synapse . In addition , future studies should evaluate the levels and activity of RNF10 in brain disorders in which synapses are known to function abnormally .",

Synapses communicate with each other via channels called synapses, which are located at the postsynaptic membrane and are responsible for transmitting information between neurons. However, it is not clear how these connections are translated into changes in gene expression. To investigate this question, Karpova et al. studied a protein messenger called RNF10. This messenger messenger is made of a group of proteins called GluN2A subunits that bind to a receptor called NMDARs. The experiments showed that the protein interacts with a subunit of NMDA receptors called long-term potentiation ( or LTP for short ). In the experiments, the messenger was found to interact with the receptor at a specific location in the neuron\u2019s synapse, where it binds to another protein that is present at another site called the nucleus. Further experiments revealed that this protein is involved in a process that involves the release of calcium ions into the cell, but not the transport of this calcium ion. Finally, a new protein called Ring Finger protein 10 was identified as a messenger that could be used to transport the gene from the synaptic site to the nuclear localization signal. These experiments show that a molecule called ring finger protein10 is able to move from a region of the excitatory neuron to its nucleus by binding to an amino acid called importin. Together, these findings suggest that these proteins are important for the transmission of information, and that they may also play a role in regulating the activity of other genes. Future work is now needed to understand how this process is carried out."

One such transcription factor is called the TATA-binding protein ( TBP for short ) . Mot1 is a remodeling enzyme that can form a \u201ccomplex\u201d with TBP by binding to it , and in doing so remove TBP from DNA . This silences the genes at those sites . The freed TBP can then bind to other promoters that lack Mot1 and activate the genes found there . In 2011 , researchers revealed the structure of the complex formed between TBP and Mot1 after TBP has been detached from DNA .

Butryn et al . \u2013 including several of the researchers involved in the 2011 work \u2013 have now described the structure of this complex using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy . Another protein called negative cofactor 2 is also part of the complex , and helps to stabilize it . Butryn et al . found that Mot1 reduces the strength of the interactions between DNA and both TBP and negative cofactor 2 . Binding to TBP and negative cofactor 2 causes the DNA molecule to bend; however , if Mot1 is also in the complex , the DNA becomes less bent . By making these changes , Mot1 is likely to prime TBP to detach from the DNA .

One of these was 500 times more potent than ternatin , which means a much lower dose of the compound is still able to kill cancer cells .

It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding OCRL , a protein that modifies a membrane lipid and that is found on membranes transporting molecules ( cargo ) into cells by a process known as endocytosis . During endocytosis , the cell outer membrane is deformed into a pit that engulfs the cargo to be taken up by the cell . The pit then pinches off from the outer membrane to form a vesicle\u2014a bubble-like compartment\u2014inside the cell that transports the cargo to its destination . In one type of endocytosis , this process is mediated by a basket-like coat primarily made up from the protein clathrin that assembles at the membrane patch to be internalized . After the vesicle is released from the cell membrane , the clathrin coat is broken apart and its components are shed and recycled for use by new budding endocytic vesicles . The OCRL protein had previously been observed associated to newly forming clathrin-coated vesicles , but the significance of this was not known . Now , N\u00e1ndez et al . have used a range of imaging and analytical techniques to further investigate the properties of OCRL , taking advantage of cells from patients with Lowe syndrome . These cells lack OCRL , and so allow the effect of OCRL's absence on cell function to be deduced . OCRL destroys the membrane lipid that helps to connect the clathrin coat to the membrane , and N\u00e1ndez et al . show that without OCRL the newly formed vesicle moves into the cell but fails to efficiently shed its clathrin coat . Thus , a large fraction of clathrin coat components remain trapped on the vesicles , reducing the amount of such components available to help new pits develop into vesicles . As a consequence , the cell has difficulty internalizing molecules . Collectively , the findings of N\u00e1ndez et al . outline that OCRL plays a role in the regulation of endocytosis in addition to its previously reported actions in the control of intracellular membrane traffic .

This search would be easier if we understood more about how the Wnt signaling pathway is controlled . When the protein GSK3 is active , it can switch the Wnt signaling pathway \u2018off\u2019 , and inactivating GSK3 can turn the Wnt signaling pathway \u2018on\u2019 .

When the enzyme is switched on or off, its activity is kept low, and it can only be activated when it has been switched off. Further experiments revealed that this activity occurs in cells that lack the Gsk3 enzyme that is responsible for producing the protein. These findings suggest that a new protein that can be used to regulate the activation of this pathway is known to be involved in intestinal tumorigenesis.

As you stand waiting to cross , tiny movements of your body \u2013 such as those due to breathing \u2013 cause you to sway by small amounts . To prevent you from falling over , your brain makes active corrections to your posture . These posture-correcting mechanisms oppose movements such as sway and keep you standing upright . But what happens when you want to cross the road ? To get you moving , your brain has two options . It could temporarily suppress the posture-correcting mechanisms . Or it could reconfigure them so that they work in a different way . The posture-correcting mechanisms rely upon sensory input from various sources . These include the vestibular system of the inner ear . The vestibular system tells the brain about the position and movement of the head in space and relative to gravity . Monitoring vestibular system activity as a person starts to move should thus reveal what is happening to the posture-correcting mechanisms . Tisserand et al . asked healthy volunteers to transition between standing still and walking , or to shift their weight from one foot to the other . At the same time , small non-painful electric currents were applied to the bones behind the volunteers' ears . These currents induced small changes in vestibular system activity . Sensors in the floor measured the forces the volunteers generated while standing or walking , thereby revealing how they adjusted their balance . The results showed that the brain suppresses its posture-correcting mechanisms before people start or stop moving . These findings have implications for robotics .

For example, in quiet standing and locomotion, the brain controls the movement of the head in space by adjusting the amount of force applied to the body. However, it is not clear whether these transitions are continuous or discrete. To investigate this question, Mullick et al. studied the vestibular system in healthy volunteers who had been exposed to electrical stimuli. The experiments show that when a person is sitting or standing upright, their head moves in a way that is consistent with their posture. This means that the muscles in the back of their heads adjust how much force they are exerting on their body to maintain balance. In contrast, when someone is standing or moving in an upright posture, they adjust their balance to allow them to keep their weight between their feet. Mian and Day found that these changes occur before and during the transition between two standing postures. Further experiments showed that this transition requires the activation of muscles engaged in balance control before the person begins to move. These findings suggest that a transition from a quiet stance to a movement-inducing posture is a discrete process, and therefore requires a gradual disengagement of this control policy before it can be implemented into motor planning."

Consequently , organisms have evolved mechanisms that allow them to measure time over 24 hours and prepare for the periodic changes between light and dark . These mechanisms , known as circadian clocks , alter the activity of some of the organism\u2019s genes in a rhythmic way across the course of a day . This in turn causes certain behaviors and biological activities of the organism to follow a daily cycle . The bacterium Synechococcus elongatus needs to be able to track the daily cycle of light and dark because it performs photosynthesis and depends on sunlight to form sugars , which can later be broken down to release energy . The time information encoded in the circadian clock of S . elongatus is transmitted to the protein RpaA , which drives the regular circadian changes in gene activity in the cell . If RpaA is removed from the cell or prevented from working , S . elongatus can no longer control rhythmic gene activity and is unable to survive the night . To better understand how the circadian system schedules biological tasks to help an organism to survive , Puszynska and O'Shea studied S . elongatus cells . This revealed that the bacteria normally prepare for darkness by storing sugars during the day and activating several genes at dusk to make enzymes that are required to break down stored sugars . This provides the cells with energy that they need to survive the night . But mutant cells that lack the gene that produces RpaA do not prepare for darkness; they do not accumulate a store of sugars during the day or activate the vital genes at dusk . They have low internal energy levels in the dark and they cannot survive long periods of darkness . Providing the mutant cells with sugar and restoring the activity of the genes responsible for breaking down sugar enabled the cells to maintain energy in darkness and survive the night . It therefore appears that one role of the circadian system of S . elongatus is to coordinate building up sugar reserves during the day with breaking down sugar stores to generate energy during the night . Puszynska and O'Shea also found many other genes that are not activated at dusk in the mutant cells . It will therefore be important to study whether other pathways that help cells to survive and grow are defective in these mutant cells .",

However, it is not clear how this clock works. Now Markson et al. have investigated the mechanisms that control the production of a protein called RpaA, which is responsible for regulating the expression of genes that are essential for photosynthesis. The experiments show that the protein is defective in regulating gene expression at night, but it can be repaired in light and dark conditions. In contrast, the gene that is normally expressed at the same time during the day has a defect that prevents it from producing carbon reserves during periods of darkness. These defects are caused by the lack of an external source of carbon for the transcription factor that controls gene activity during light/dark cycles. Further work is now needed to find out how the RPAA- protein works in this way."

As a result , proteins studded through the cell membrane act as gatekeepers to finetune import and export . These proteins are central to health and disease; their defect can lead to fatal illnesses in humans , and they also help bacteria infect other organisms . Despite their importance , little is known about some of these metal-export proteins . This is particularly the case for PIB-4-ATPases , a subclass found in plants and bacteria and which includes , for example , a metal transporter required for bacteria to cause tuberculosis . Intricate knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of these proteins would help to understand how they select metals , shuttle the compounds in and out of cells , and are controlled by other cellular processes . To reveal this three-dimensional organisation , Gr\u00f8nberg et al . used X-ray diffraction , where high-energy radiation is passed through crystals of protein to reveal the positions of atoms . They focused on a type of PIB-4-ATPases found in bacteria as an example . The work showed that the protein does not contain the metal-binding regions seen in other classes of metal exporters; however , it sports unique features that are crucial for metal transport such as an adapted pathway for the transport of zinc and cobalt across the membrane . In addition , Gr\u00f8nberg et al . tested thousands of compounds to see if they could block the activity of the protein , identifying two that could kill bacteria . This better understanding of how PIB-4-ATPases work could help to engineer plants capable of removing heavy metals from contaminated soils , as well as uncover new compounds to be used as antibiotics .",

They are also highly toxic to humans and other animals, and can cause neurological diseases and neurological disease. Heavy-metal transporting P-type ( PIB ) ATPases are crucial for homeostasis, conferring cellular detoxification and redistribution through transport of these ions across cellular membranes. However, it remains unclear how these transport proteins work. To address this question, Zielazinski et al. used a technique called the \u2018Baginski assay\u2019 to study the structure of a group of ATPase proteins. The experiments revealed that the proteins are made up of four core states, each containing a specific set of amino acids, which are responsible for transporting the transport metal ions. This revealed several new features, including the ability to transport the transported ions within the cell membrane. Further work is now needed to determine the structures of the other four main proteins, as well as to understand how they work in different environments. In the future, these findings could lead to the development of new drugs to treat diseases caused by heavy metal transport."

        "ground_truth": "Understanding how genes are activated and silenced is one of the central challenges in modern biology . These processes underpin the development of a fertilized egg into a complex organism , and they can also lead to life-threatening diseases when they go wrong . There are two copies of each gene in a human cell , a maternal copy and a paternal copy , and it is thought that both copies are usually regulated together . However , there are exceptions to this rule: for certain genes only the maternal copy is expressed as a protein in some cells , whereas the paternal copy is expressed in other cells . This form of gene regulation , which is called monoallelic expression , can result in neighboring cells heading down very different paths . In extreme cases , depending on the differences between the two copies of the gene , cells that express one copy may function normally , while cells where the other copy is activated will start forming tumors . However , despite these potentially grave consequences , and early results which suggested that monoallelic expression affected a large number of human and mouse genes , it has proved to be a major technical challenge to identify these genes in most cell types . Now , Nag , Savova et al . have discovered a molecular signature that can be used to detect monoallelic expression . The signature was found in chromatin , the densely packed structure formed by DNA and proteins inside the cell nucleus . Nag , Savova et al . discovered that the genes that are subject to monoallelic expression are bound with proteins that are modified in two contrasting ways . One modification , which is usually a sign of gene silencing , is prevalent on the inactive copy of the gene , and the other , which often marks active genes , is chiefly present on the active copy . Nag , Savova et al . report that these modifications are found in different sets of genes in different cell types , indicating distinct genome-wide patterns of monoallelic expression . The chromatin signature approach lets them estimate the fraction of human genes that are subject to monoallelic expression . This number is surprisingly high: about 20% of commonly expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes . In a particularly intriguing finding , almost all bivalent genes\u2014a subset of genes that are involved in determining the fate of cell during development\u2014are estimated to become monoallelic when they are activated . In addition to these unexpected findings , the chromatin signature approach opens the door to exploring monoallelic expression as a form of gene regulation in all types of cells and , ultimately , to understanding how it is involved in both normal development and in disease .",
        "first_gen": "Mammals have a wide range of genetic and epigenetic factors that control the expression of many of the genes in their cells. For example, a gene called the X chromosome is expressed either from one of two copies of each given gene, and the other from the maternal X. However, it is not clear how this process is regulated in mammals. To address this question, Zwemer et al. have used a technique called chromatin analysis to identify genes that are subject to monoallelic expression ( MAE ) in human and mouse lymphoblasts. The analysis revealed that a group of genes called BAE genes are expressed in the same way in both male and female cells, but in different cell types. This suggests that the presence of a molecule called active transcription ( H3K36me3 ) is responsible for the production of this molecule. In contrast, the absence of an enzyme called silencing is thought to be the main cause of human diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( DAPK1 ) and cancer. Yet, little is known about the molecular features that enable MAEs to occur in other types of cell, including in humans and mice. By studying the DNA sequences of over 20% of known human genes and over half of all known biallelically expressed genes, Meyer, Nag and others have identified a molecular feature that is independent of MPAE. It is also possible to distinguish between the two versions of one gene in one cell type and not another in another. Further work is now needed to determine whether this feature is linked to the development of other diseases."

As a result , cells contain biological machines that refold or break down misfolded proteins . ATP-dependent AAA+ proteases are an example of such machines . Their activity needs to be tightly controlled because breaking down the wrong proteins can also harm cells . ATP-dependent AAA+ proteases form ring-shaped assemblies that are composed of AAA+ proteins and an associated peptidase . In bacteria , the AAA+ protein called ClpC can be crucial for resisting stress and infecting host cells . Adapter proteins help to activate ClpC by binding to extra domains that are fused to or inserted into the protein . This method of activation also requires repressing elements that ensure that the activity of ClpC remains low when the adapter proteins are not present . It was not known how this repression works . Carroni , Franke et al . have now used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structures of repressed and adapter-activated ClpC from pathogenic bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus . In the repressed state , 10 molecules of ClpC interact to form two assemblies that interact via regions called middle domains . The middle domains have a \u201ccoiled coil\u201d structure , and they interact via their ends in a head-to-head manner . In the repressed state ClpC cannot interact with its partner peptidase and the shape of the assembly shields the sites where adapter proteins can bind . This renders ClpC inactive . Carroni , Franke et al . also studied ClpC proteins that had mutations to the middle domain that prevented the repressed state from forming . The mutant proteins remain in a constantly active state that is highly toxic to bacteria . Bacteria are increasingly evolving to resist the effects of the antibiotics commonly used to treat infections . This is a severe problem , and we need to develop new antibiotic drugs that will kill these bacteria . AAA+ proteases have been identified as possible targets for new antibacterial drugs . The results presented by Carroni , Franke et al . suggest that disrupting the repressing activity of ClpC middle domains could be an effective way for such drugs to work .",
        "first_gen": "A protein called AAA+ is an enzyme that is responsible for controlling the activity of many cellular processes. It is made up of a series of structures called coiled-coil middle domains, which are connected to each other to form a ring-like structure called a central pore. This ring is tightly controlled by a group of enzymes called peptidases that attach to the ring to control its activity. These enzymes are also involved in many other cellular activities. One of these proteins, called ClpC, is essential for the growth of bacteria. However, it is not clear how this protein works. To investigate this question, Heuck et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of the cell\u2019s cell membrane. The experiments revealed that the clpc protein is repressed in a \u201cground\u201d state by two proteins called MecA and Hsp104. In this state, the protein interacts with a protein that forms a protective ring around the middle domain, and then binds to it to release the ATP from the outer ring. As a result, this ring becomes a structure that can be used as a scaffold for other proteins to bind to. Further experiments showed that this scaffolding works in the same way as the rest of an AAA protein, but that it was not as tightly regulated as previously thought. Furthermore, when the cells were exposed to high levels of ATP, they were more likely to die. Together, these findings suggest that a new regulatory mechanism is in place to tightly control the activities of AAA proteins. A new class of antibiotics called acyldepsipeptide ( or ADEP for short ) could be developed to treat these conditions."

These cells are produced by stem cells , which often reside in a special microenvironment called the stem cell niche . This niche may also contain support cells that produce signals to attract stem cells and then maintain them in a dormant state . When the muscle is damaged , its resident stem cells are activated so that they divide to produce new cells . Understanding how this happens is an important goal for regenerative medicine , but many of the details remain unclear . In fruit flies , stem cells called adult muscle precursor cells ( or AMPs for short ) lie dormant in the embryo and larva , but are then activated to form the muscles of the adult fly . These cells share many features with the muscle stem cells of mammals , which prompted Aradhya , Zmojdzian et al . to use them as a model to investigate how stem cells find their niche and are later activated . For the experiments , the AMPs in fruit fly larvae were labelled with a fluorescent protein . Aradhya , Zmojdzian et al . observed that these cells produce long extensions that connect them to each other , to nearby muscle and to nerve cells . During development , these extensions are gradually lost until they contact only the muscles that are closest to the AMPs , which indicates that these muscles provide a niche for the AMPs and are perhaps involved in their activation . Further experiments show that neighbouring muscles do indeed help to activate AMPs , as they produce a signal that activates a cell communication system called the insulin pathway inside the AMPs . Insulin signalling \u2013 which is sensitive to the availability of nutrients in the body \u2013 turns on another signalling pathway , called Notch , that then stimulate the AMPs to divide . Aradhya , Zmojdzian et al . propose that this signalling cascade might help to ensure that AMPs are only activated at the right time in development . The next step is to find out whether stem cells in human muscles are activated in a similar way .",

These stem cells have a unique ability to maintain a quiescent undifferentiated state, but how they do so remains poorly understood. Now, Figeac et al. have used genetic and molecular techniques to study the behavior of adult muscle cells, which are known as muscle precursors ( AMPs for short ). The experiments show that the AMP cells communicate with neighboring muscles in a \u2018sensing\u2019 way that allows them to respond to the signals sent by the muscles. This signals are then switched on by a protein called dIlp6 to switch on the Insulin pathway on and off in the cells. In fruit fly embryos, the Drosophila cells send out thin filopodia that make contact with nearby muscles to signal the activation of a signaling pathway called the Notch pathway. However, it is not clear how these cells react to these signals, or whether they are able to reactivate their dormant state. To address this question, Br\u00f6hl and Tavi used a computer model to follow the activity of the adult stem cell cells in fruit flies. They found that these adult cells move out of their inactive state when they start to proliferate, and when the muscle is damaged or damaged. Moreover, when a muscle starts to grow and mature, these new cells become attached to neighboring cells to form an interconnected network. Further experiments showed that this network is activated via a cascade of signals that switch the insulin pathway ON and OFF in other muscle cell types. Together these findings provide new insights into how the growth of muscles is controlled. Future work will also help us to understand the mechanisms that control the reactivation of these stem-cell populations in more detail."

This spontaneous activity has a number of important roles . For example , in a part of the brain known as the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ) , spontaneously active neurons frequently produce electrical signals that reduce electrical activity in other brain areas . A current of positively charged ions constantly flows into the spontaneously active SNr neurons and enables them to fire constantly . Ions enter neurons through proteins called ion channels that are embedded in the surface of the neuron . Like all proteins , ion channels are made by \u201ctranscribing\u201d genes to form molecules of RNA that are then \u201ctranslated\u201d to produce the basic sequence of the protein . Lutas et al . have now used single-cell RNA sequencing to study SNr neurons from mice and investigate which ion channel the positive ion current flows through . The RNA sequences revealed that the neurons have the gene for an ion channel known as NALCN . Recordings of the firing rate of neurons in slices of mouse brain showed that SNr neurons without this channel did not fire as often as SNr neurons with the channel . In addition , neurotransmitters ( chemicals that alter the ability of neurons to fire ) and changes in cell metabolism had less of an effect on the firing rate of SNr neurons that lacked the NALCN channel than they do on normal neurons . These findings may help explain why people with mutations in the NALCN gene have movement disorders , as the substantia nigra pars reticulata plays an important role in orchestrating complex movements . Future work is now needed to understand how a change in NALCN activity affects the other brain areas that SNr neurons connect to .",

However, it is not clear how the neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ) are able to continuously fire their action potentials.

Now, Picelli et al. have used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to study the activity of individual neurons from a mouse brain region. The experiments revealed that a channel called the nonselective cation channel, or NSCC, is present in many neurons that are spontaneously active. In particular, neurons lacking this channel were less likely to fire than those that were active in other neurons, suggesting that it may be involved in regulating the firing of nerve cells. Further experiments also showed that neurons with a leak-like channel in their neurons also had less activity than neurons without the channel. These findings suggest that this leakage channel is important for firing the active neurons and may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in this gene."

In the 20th and 21st centuries antibiotics saved millions of lives , but new strains of dangerous bacteria that cannot be killed by antibiotics , known as antibiotic resistant strains , are becoming more frequent .

So it is possible that microorganisms outside this small group can produce different antibiotics that are effective against antibiotic resistant strains . Unfortunately , finding the microorganisms that produce these alternative antibiotics is challenging because researchers do not know which bacteria are producing these molecules and how to grow these microorganisms in the laboratory .

This is because the vast majority of bacteria are unculturable, meaning that they can only grow at their own speed without competition for space or nutrients. To overcome this gap, researchers have developed a series of new methods to study the diversity of bacterial communities. One of these methods is called microscale cultivation, in which a small number of microorganisms can be grown in a single cell. However, it is not possible to grow all the bacteria in one cell at the same time, and this is a problem for many species. Now, Mahler et al. have used a technique called droplet cultivation to explore this problem. The method used to cultivate bacteria from single cells in droplets was directly coupled to a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. In the process, the cells were isolated from a soil sample, where they were then genetically modified to produce a variety of compounds that could be used as an antibiotic. These experiments show that the method can produce hundreds of thousands of different compounds at once, even if they are only used for a few hours per day. Further experiments showed that these compounds were able to inhibit intact reporter strains that had been exposed to the presence of antimicrobials. More experiments are now needed to understand how this process works."

Without treatment , it is always fatal: even with proper antibiotics , about a quarter of patients do not survive and many will have permanent brain damage . Overactive inflammation is thought to contribute to this process . Corticosteroid drugs , which dampen the inflammatory process , are therefore often used during treatment . However , they merely reduce mortality by 30% , suggesting that only some people benefit from them . Two recent studies have linked the genetic makeup of individuals who have tuberculous meningitis to how they respond to corticosteroids . There were , in particular , differences in the LTA4H gene that codes for an inflammation-causing protein . According to these results , only individuals carrying high-inflammation versions of the LTA4H gene would benefit from the treatment . Yet a third study did not find any effect of the genetic background of patients . All three papers used frequentist statistics to draw their conclusions , only examining the percentage of people who survived in each group . Yet , this type of analysis can miss important details .

It is caused by excessive inflammation, which can lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of people each year. Treatments that reduce inflammation can also reduce the risk of death. However, it is not clear why this happens. One possibility is that inflammation causes too little or too much inflammation. To investigate this, Fava, Schurr et al. used a technique called Bayesian analysis to compare data from two groups of patients in Vietnam and Indonesia. The experiments showed that the survival benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with a variant of the gene that encodes a protein called leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ). This gene is important for the balance of pro- and anti\u2013inflammatory eicosanoids, and it was found to be important in people who had high levels of this protein in their blood. In both groups, the effect of glucocorticoid therapy was less pronounced than in those who did not have this gene. Further analysis revealed that this effect was only seen in individuals with the high level of inflammation and those with hyper-inflammation. These findings suggest that patients who have a high risk for developing this type of disease are more likely to benefit from the treatment. Yet, these findings are not consistent with previous studies that have shown that people with an elevated level in a gene encoding an enzyme that regulates inflammation have less survival than those without a higher level. Favares, S\u00e1nchez-Garcia, van Laarhoven and Schueman also found that these patients had a lower likelihood of dying before the drug was given to them. They also had higher survival rates than patients without the low-level inflammation gene, suggesting that they were less likely than the other patients to die before their treatment had started. Overall, this finding suggests that there is a large range of factors that underlie the difference in survival between the two populations. A future challenge will be to test this hypothesis in more clinical trials."

A neuron can connect to another by growing a branch-like structure known as the axon . To contact the correct neuron , the axon must develop and thread its way to exactly the right place in the brain . Scientists know that the tip of the axon is extraordinarily sensitive to gradients of certain molecules in its surroundings , which guide the budding structure towards its final destination . In particular , two molecules seem to play an important part in this process: netrin-1 , which is a protein found outside cells that attracts a growing axon , and shootin1a , which is present inside neurons . Previous studies have shown that netrin-1 can trigger a cascade of reactions that activates shootin1a . In turn , activated shootin1a molecules join the internal skeleton of the cell with L1-CAM , a molecule that attaches the neuron to its surroundings . If the internal skeleton is the engine of the axon , L1-CAMs are the wheels , and shootin1a the clutch . However , it is not clear whether shootin1a is involved in guiding growing axons , and how it could help neurons \u2018understand\u2019 and react to gradients of netrin-1 . Here , Baba et al . discover that when shootin1a is absent in mice , the axons do not develop properly . Further experiments in rat neurons show that if there is a little more netrin-1 on one side of the tip of an axon , this switches on the shootin1a molecules on that edge . Activated shootin1a promote interactions between the internal skeleton and L1-CAM , helping the axon curve towards the area that has more netrin-1 . In fact , if the activated shootin1a is present everywhere on the axon , and not just on one side , the structure can develop , but not turn . Taken together , the results suggest that shootin1a can read the gradients of netrin-1 and then coordinate the turning of a growing axon in response . Wound healing , immune responses or formation of organs are just a few examples of processes that rely on cells moving in an orderly manner through the body . Dissecting how axons are guided through their development may shed light on the migration of cells in general .

The growth cone is located at the tip of the axon, and it is known that it senses and produces forces for the growth cones to move. However, it was not clear how this guidance mechanism works.

This information is then translated into a signal that instructs the cells to orient themselves in a particular direction. In mice lacking this signal, the neurons grow abnormally in their forebrain commissures, which is thought to be caused by the presence of a receptor that is deleted in colorectal cancer. It is not known how the netrin-1 signaling pathway works, but it has been suggested that this pathway may be regulated by a signaling molecule called Pak1. To investigate this possibility, Kataoka, Toriyama, Sotelo and others genetically engineered mice to produce mutant mice that lacked the gene that encodes the protein. These mice showed abnormal projections of their brains, a phenotype similar to the ones seen in mice with a mutation in gene editing that causes them to lose the ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal shapes. Further experiments showed that the mutant mouse brain cells that lack this gene were unable to detect the signal and generate force. Furthermore, these mice also had abnormal guidance of neurons in addition to abnormal shape. KATAoka et. also found that these mutant animals were able to generate forces that were not produced in normal mice.

Bird wings generate large vortices of air to boost their lift and hover in the air that can generate tones . Further , the airflow over bird wings can be highly turbulent , meaning it can generate loud sounds , like the jets of air coming out of the engines of aircraft . Given all the sound-generating mechanisms at hand , it is difficult to determine why some wings buzz whereas others whoosh or hum . Hightower , Wijnings et al . wanted to understand the physical mechanism that causes animal wings to whine , buzz , hum or whoosh in flight . They hypothesized that the aerodynamic forces generated by animal wings are the main source of their characteristic wing sounds . Hummingbird wings have the most features in common with different animals\u2019 wings , while also featuring acoustically complex feathers . This makes them ideal models for deciphering how birds , bats and even insects make wing sounds .

A three-dimensional \u2018acoustic hologram\u2019 was generated using 2 , 176 microphones to measure the humming sound from all directions . In a follow-up experiment , the aerodynamic forces the hummingbird wings generate to hover were also measured . Their wingbeat was filmed simultaneously in slow-motion in both experiments . Hightower , Wijnings et al . then used a mathematical model that governs the wing\u2019s aeroacoustics to confirm that the aerodynamic forces generated by the hummingbirds\u2019 wings cause the humming sound heard when they hover in front of a flower . The model shows that the oscillating aerodynamic forces generate harmonics , which give the wings\u2019 hum the acoustic quality of a musical instrument . Using this model Hightower , Wijnings et al . found that the differences in the aerodynamic forces generated by bird and insect wings cause the characteristic timbres of their whines , buzzes , hums , or whooshes . They also determined how these sounds scale with body mass and flapping frequency across 170 insect species and 80 bird species . This showed that mosquitos are unusually loud for their body size due to the unusual unsteadiness of the aerodynamic forces they generate in flight . These results explain why flying animals\u2019 wings sound the way they do \u2013 for example , why larger birds are quieter and mosquitos louder . Better understanding of how the complex forces generated by animal wings create sound can advance the study of how animals change their wingbeat to communicate . Further , the model that explains how complex aerodynamic forces cause sound can help make the sounds of aerial robots , drones , and fans not only more silent , but perhaps more pleasing , like the hum of a hummingbird .",

To answer this question, Seo et al. studied six freely hovering hummingbird wings in the laboratory. They used a microphone array to measure the sound produced by the wings as they moved through air. This revealed that the hum generated by these wings is driven by an oscillating force called the \u201cwingbeat\u201d. In addition, the wingbeat generates a sound that is similar to an insect's whoosh. These findings suggest that this humming song may also be a signal to predators that are looking for prey.

These questions are hard to study because evolution happened only once , long ago . To overcome this barrier , Xie , Pu , Metzger et al . developed an experimental approach that can evolve reconstructed ancestral proteins that existed deep in the past . Using this method , it is possible to replay evolution multiple times , from various historical starting points , under conditions similar to those that existed long ago .

These proteins have diversified greatly over time in both their genetic sequences and their ability to bind to specific partner proteins called co-regulators . Xie , Pu , Metzger et al . synthesized BCL-2 proteins that existed at various times in the past . Each ancestral protein was then allowed to evolve repeatedly under natural selection to acquire the same co-regulator binding functions that evolved during history . At the end of each evolutionary trajectory , the genetic sequence of the resulting BCL-2 proteins was recorded . This revealed that the outcomes of evolution were almost completely unpredictable: trajectories initiated from the same ancestral protein produced proteins with very different sequences , and proteins launched from different ancestral starting points were even more dissimilar . Further experiments identified the mutations in each trajectory that caused changes in coregulator binding . When these mutations were introduced into other ancestral proteins , they did not yield the same change in function . This suggests that early chance events influenced each protein\u2019s evolution in an unpredictable way by opening and closing the paths available to it in the future . This research expands our understanding of evolution on a molecular level whilst providing a new experimental approach for studying evolutionary drivers in more detail . The results suggest that BCL-2 proteins , in all their various forms , are unique products of a particular , unpredictable course of history set in motion by ancient chance events .",
        "first_gen": "The roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in evolution have never been assessed in a single system or on timescales relevant to the evolution of living things. For example, it is not clear how chance and contingency play out in the same system, or how they contribute to evolution. To answer this question, Pu et al. used a technique called \u2018continuous evolution\u2019 to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of the B-cell lymphoma-2 family of proteins that evolved during the deep past. The experiments showed that the genes that encode proteins in this family were switched on or off when they were introduced into different ancestral environments. In the experiments, the proteins were selected to acquire specific molecular features that would help them to perform specific roles in their environment. This revealed that chance was the primary driver of these changes, but it was not the only factor that influenced how these proteins evolved. Future studies will need to find out whether chance or necessity also played a role in these processes."

        "ground_truth": "Our genomes contain a record of historical events . This is because when groups of people are separated for generations , the DNA sequence in the two groups\u2019 genomes will change in different ways . Looking at the differences in the genomes of people from the same population can help researchers to understand and reconstruct the historical interactions that brought their ancestors together . The mixing of two populations that were previously separate is known as admixture . Africa as a continent has few written records of its history . This means that it is somewhat unknown which important movements of people in the past generated the populations found in modern-day Africa . Busby et al . have now attempted to use DNA to look into this and reconstruct the last 4000 years of genetic history in African populations . As has been shown in other regions of the world , the new analysis showed that all African populations are the result of historical admixture events . However , Busby et al . could characterize these events to unprecedented level of detail . For example , multiple ethnic groups from The Gambia and Mali all show signs of sharing the same set of ancestors from West Africa , Europe and Asia who mixed around 2000 years ago . Evidence of a migration of people from Central West Africa , known as the Bantu expansion , could also be detected , and was shown to carry genes to the south and east . An important next step will be to now look at the consequences of the observed gene-flow , and ask if it has contributed to spreading beneficial , or detrimental , mutations around Africa .",
        "first_gen": "The human genome contains the genetic information needed to make a person\u2019s genetic material. This information is then passed on to the next generation, which can then be used to study diseases that affect different populations across the globe. For example, if a gene is inherited from one person, it can be duplicated by another person in the same gene. However, this is not the case for all people, and it is still not clear how genetic variation in Africa is linked to disease. Gurdasani et al. have now used a technique called genome-wide analysis to identify which groups of people share genetic variants with each other in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis revealed that a large proportion of African populations share a common ancestor with people from outside of their current geographic region, but not all of these groups share an ancestral ancestor. In addition, the analysis also found that some African groups are more likely to share their ancestral ancestry with groups from other parts of Africa, such as the Fulani of Central West Africa and the Yoruba of Niger-Congo. These findings provide new insights into how the African population has evolved over the last 4000 years, as well as how it has changed over that time."

        "ground_truth": "In the earliest stages of development , animal cells undergo multiple rounds of division without growth via a process known as mitosis . Over the course of just 12 rounds of cell division , a single fertilized egg is transformed into more than 4000 smaller cells . Before dividing , the cell must first replicate its chromosomes . A structure called the mitotic spindle then separates the members of each chromosome pair and distributes them evenly between the two daughter cells . Given that the daughter cells become smaller with each round of division , the spindle must also become smaller to ensure that the chromosomes are pulled apart an appropriate distance . However , it has been unclear how the cell achieves this . Now , Wilbur and Heald report insights into the mechanism by which spindle size is coordinated with cell size , using the model organism Xenopus laevis\u2014a frog that produces large embryos that are easy to manipulate . They began by preparing extracts of cytoplasm from X . laevis embryos at two different developmental stages: one set of embryos contained 4 cells each and the other set contained \u223c4000 cells . They found that the spindle , which is composed largely of microtubules\u2014hollow filaments that can become longer or shorter through the addition or removal of tubulin building blocks\u2014was almost twice as large in the four-cell embryos as in the more developed embryos . Moreover , spindle size was determined by the actions of two proteins: kif2a and importin-\u03b1 . Binding of kif2a destabilized microtubules and caused them to shorten; importin-\u03b1 blocked this process by binding to kif2a and preventing it from interacting with microtubules . Wilbur and Heald found that over the course of development , importin-\u03b1 became increasingly localized to the cell membrane , meaning that there was less available to bind to kif2a in the cytoplasm . This freed up kif2a to interact with and destabilize microtubules , and led ultimately to a reduction in spindle size . Given that the overall ratio of cell surface membrane to cytoplasm increases as cells undergo division without growth , interaction between kif2a and importin-\u03b1 could be the long-sought mechanism by which spindle and cell sizes are coordinated early in development .",
        "first_gen": "The development of many animals is characterized by rapid cleavages that dramatically decrease cell size, but how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell sizes is not well understood. To understand how this happens, Levy et al. used a technique called cytoplasmic extracts from embryos to measure the size differences between the two stages of embryonic development. The experiments show that the cells of a frog called Xenopus laevis, which has a single genetic background, have different sizes of chromosomes compared to those of an egg. However, the exact mechanisms that control the amount of microtubules in the cell are not fully understood, and it was not known whether the spindles of the frog also change their size during development, or if they do. Loughlin, Brugues and Heald have now developed an in vitro system that simulates the differences in size between different stages in embryos. In the experiments, a protein called kinesin-13 kif2a was added to the egg extracts. This protein was then removed from the eggs and the embryo extracts were then grown in a laboratory. These experiments revealed that in stages 3 and stage 8, cells grow to a size of \u223c35 to 40 \u00b5m, whereas in stage 9, they grew to \u223c20 to 30 \u00b5ms. By contrast, stages 8 and 9 were much smaller in both stages, suggesting that a change in how cells divide is likely to have a major impact on the growth of these cells."

        "ground_truth": "Life on Earth is magnificently complex . The instructions to make this complexity are stored within the genes of living cells . For many genes , this process involves two steps . First , the cells copy , or transcribe , the information in the gene \u2013 which is part of a DNA molecule \u2013 into a more portable but shorter-lived molecule called RNA . The RNA can then be transported to other parts of a cell where its information is decoded to make a protein . Proteins are like molecular machines and making proteins is how many genes contribute to keeping life going . RNA molecules can fold into intricate shapes including structures called riboswitches . These are parts of an RNA molecule that can control how and when the RNA is used to make proteins . Riboswitches detect the presence of other chemicals inside a cell and respond by changing their shape . Binding to the right molecule will move a riboswitch from an \u201coff\u201d to an \u201con\u201d position , or vice versa . Riboswitches can help to ensure that some proteins are only made when they are needed . For example , a protein that helps to make a certain chemical is only produced when that chemical is in short supply . Sherlock et al . have now studied riboswitches in a species of bacteria called Facklamia ignava . The investigation revealed a new riboswitch structure that detects phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate , or PRPP , which is a building block for RNA and , eventually , DNA molecules . Further examination revealed that these riboswitches are often linked to others that detect guanine molecules \u2013 another component of RNA and DNA . This double riboswitch is similar to a logic gate in computing , activating or shutting down protein production in response to changes in the concentrations of both PRPP and guanine . The findings of Sherlock et al . reveal a system where RNA controls its own production in response to the availability of two of its critical building blocks . This entirely RNA-dependent system adds weight to the so-called \u2018RNA world\u2019 hypothesis which suggests that the earliest forms of life on Earth depended solely on RNA . Molecules of RNA are able to store data like DNA while also behaving as molecular machines like proteins . This potentially helps to explain how the first life could have arisen from simple , non-living chemicals . Riboswitch systems like this are likely to be relics of this ancient time . Also , because they are involved in fundamental processes in living bacteria , riboswitch systems also provide potentially interesting targets for new antibiotics .",
        "first_gen": "RNA molecules are made up of molecules called messenger RNAs. The RNA molecules that make up a protein are produced by a process called transcription, which is carried out by the enzyme that makes the messenger RNA molecule. However, it is not clear how the transcription process works without the help of proteins. A group of genes called ribonucleotide derivatives ( or riboswitches for short ) are thought to have evolved from the RNA World, but it was not known how they did so. Now, Nelson, Reiss et al. have used a technique called RNA termination assays to investigate how ribonswitch derivatives work in bacteria. These experiments revealed that two RNA derivatives called guanine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) can bind to each other in a tandem arrangement. In the experiments, the two molecules were found to bind together to form a pair that could be used to control the expression of the genes in the bacterium Firmicutes. Further experiments showed that these two types of RNA can also be found in tandem with one another. This suggests that Riboswitch aptamers could have been able to regulate the production of these molecules without any help from protein regulatory factors. Furthermore, this work provides new insights into how RNA-like molecules work."

        "ground_truth": "Our nervous system allows us to rapidly sense and respond to the world around us via cells called neurons that relay electrical signals around the brain and body . When an electrical impulse travelling along one neuron reaches a junction \u2013 called a synapse \u2013 with a neighboring neuron , it stimulates small containers known as vesicles from the first cell to release their contents into the synapse . These contents then travel across to the neighboring cell and may generate a new electrical impulse . The number of vesicles at a synapse that are ready to be released varies from one to ten . The more vesicles the neuron releases , the more likely the second cell will produce an electrical signal of its own . However , not all electrical signals reaching a synapse stimulate vesicles to be released and some signals only release a single vesicle . What determines how many vesicles are released by a single electrical signal ? Some vesicles have a higher likelihood of being released than others , but this \u201ceagerness\u201d does not always predict how many vesicles an individual synapse will actually discharge . Now , Vaden et al . have used brain tissue from mice to test an alternative possibility: the simple idea that the number of vesicles available at the synapse affects how many vesicles are released without altering their eagerness for release . Vaden et al . found that activating an enzyme called protein kinase A increased the number of vesicles released from synapses without changing how likely individual vesicles were to be released . Inhibiting protein kinase A also did not change individual vesicle\u2019s eagerness to be released , but did decrease the number of vesicles that were discharged . Further experiments found that protein kinase A modifies a molecule on the surface of vesicles , known as synapsin , which controls the number of vesicles that are available for release . These findings show that the number of vesicles released at a synapse is controlled by two independently regulated parameters: the number of vesicles that are available , as well as how eager individual vesicles are to be released . The ability of neurons to communicate with each other is disrupted in autism spectrum disorders , Alzheimer\u2019s disease and many other diseases . Learning how neurons communicate in healthy brains will help us understand what happens in the neurons of individuals with these conditions .",
        "first_gen": "Neurons communicate with each other via a network of synapses. Each synapse contains a single vesicle, which is released into the synaptic cleft by a protein called synapsin. This protein is responsible for controlling the number of synaptic connections between neurons in the brain. Synapses are made up of many different types of neurons, and each type of neuron is able to communicate in a coordinated manner. However, it was previously thought that only one neurotransmitter can be released at a time. Now, Nusser et al. have used mouse brain slices to investigate this idea. The experiments show that the amount of neurotransmitters that are released in response to an action potential depends on the size of the active zone. In the experiments, the researchers measured the levels of glutamate concentration at the junctions between the two active zones. They found that when the activity potential was high, glutamate concentrations were higher than in normal conditions. When glutamate levels were low, this increased the likelihood that glutamate would enter the cell. Further experiments showed that a signaling pathway called cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A ( cAMP ) regulates the release of a small pool of molecules, known as the \u2018multivesicular release\u2019 ( MVR ) pathway. These findings suggest that this pathway is important for the reliability of communication between brain regions. Future work will be needed to understand the molecular mechanisms that control this mechanism."

When HIV-1 infects a person , it targets cells of the immune system , which normally act to defend the body against infections . As the virus spreads from one immune cell to the next , it weakens the immune system so that individuals become more vulnerable to other illnesses . A cell infected with HIV-1 creates new virus particles at its surface and then releases the particles so that they can infect other cells . HIV-1 viruses encode their genetic information as molecules of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . However , the host cell also makes many other RNA molecules that do not contain virus genes so there must be a mechanism in place to ensure that the new virus particles only contain viral RNA . An HIV-1 protein called Gag is responsible for assembling new virus particles and several Gag proteins come together on the cell membrane to form a honeycomb-like structure called the immature lattice . However , it is not clear how Gag is able to select the right RNA molecules . To study how RNA is packaged into new HIV-1 particles , Carlson et al . used artificial versions of the cell membrane , viral RNA and the virus protein Gag to create a simple cell-free system . This system shows that all that is needed for viral RNA to be correctly packaged into new HIV-1 particles is for Gag to be attached to the cell membrane in such a way that the lattice forms correctly . Disturbing the immature lattice by altering the Gag proteins can result in a drastic loss of RNA selectivity . Further experiments show that other molecules in host cells called transfer RNAs enhance the ability of Gag to select the RNAs that encode virus genes . Carlson et al . \u2019s findings reveal a link between the formation of the Gag lattice and the packaging of virus genes into new virus particles . Drugs that inhibit this process could have the potential to be used as therapies against HIV-1 . A future challenge will be to re-create the entire process of HIV-1 assembly in a cell-free system , which would make it easier to develop new drugs that target the process .",
        "first_gen": "HIV-1 is an infectious virus that infects humans and other animals. The virus is made up of a protein called Gag, which is found on the surface of the host\u2019s plasma membrane. This protein is able to package the genome of an infected virus in a way that makes it easier for it to assemble into a virus. However, it is not clear how this process is carried out. To investigate this question, Kuzembayeva et al. used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs called giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) to create a small system that could be used to study the assembly of viruses in the presence of excess viral RNA. In the experiments, the virus was packaged on a membrane that contains a large amount of RNA, and then packaged onto the cell membrane to make a new viral protein. When the GAG proteins were purified, they found that they were more likely to bind to the RNA than when they had been purified. These findings suggest that the ability of Gags to selectively package its genome and its self-assembly on membranes is dependent on how much RNA it has been packaged into the viral genome. Further work is now needed to find out whether this is also the case for other viral proteins."
