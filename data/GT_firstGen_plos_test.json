Through this, numerous host pathways were identified that were modulated by the virus including: antiviral response and endothelial cell leakage. Notably, the genes encoding DDX60, a cytosolic component of RIG-I signalling pathway and OAS2 were both shown to be dysregulated. Interestingly, PTPRR was induced in Huh6 cells but not HepGs2 cells, and polymorphisms in TLR9 have been associated with poor outcomes in patients.

Finally, individual differences in the resource allocation variability predicted variation of symptom severity, highlighting its functional relevance to schizophrenia.
