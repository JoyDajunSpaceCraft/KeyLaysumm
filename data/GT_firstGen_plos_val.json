Limited financial resources meant that people were neither able to purchase more than one pair of shoe to ensure their longevity nor afford shoes of their preferred quality.

In the rat , mutations producing demyelination have been frequently identified and characterized and have contributed to a better understanding of the genetics of myelin development , physiology , and pathology . This paper reports the molecular characterization of a recessive allele responsible for the progressive disruption of myelin that was initially observed in mutant rats , previously named demyelination ( dmy ) . This mutation generates an additional splicing acceptor site in an intron of the mitochondrial Mg2+ transporter gene ( Mrs2 ) , resulting in the insertion of a 83-bp genomic DNA segment into the Mrs2 transcript and complete functional inactivation of the mutant allele . We firstly defined the biological function of MRS2 in mammals and demonstrated the crucial and unexpected role of MRS2 in myelin physiology .

It is produced by oligodendrocytes, while in the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ), this function is achieved by Schwann cells. Myelination is completed within a relatively short period of time during mammalian development and requires a high rate of production and transport of different kinds of molecules, mostly proteins and lipids. In adult life, the maintenance of functional myelin sheaths requires careful balance of de novo synthesis and turnover. Here, we report the molecular characterization of this mutation and discuss the possible pathomechanisms underlying demyelinating. We found that a G-to-A transition, 177 bp downstream of exon 3 of Mrs2 ( MRS2 magnesium homeostasis factor ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) ) gene, generated a novel splice acceptor site, which resulted in functional inactivation of a mutant allele. Our findings led to the conclusion that dmy/dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease with a markedly elevated lactic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, a 60% reduction in ATP, and increased mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death, depending on the duration of knock-down treatment."}, {"ground_truth": "It has been shown that microarray based gene expression signatures have the potential to be powerful tools for patient stratification , diagnosis of disease , prognosis of survival , assessment of risk group , and selection of treatment .

Introduction of transgenes into the germ cells of schistosome eggs might result in transgenic schistosomes . However , the egg is surrounded by a thick shell which might block access to entry of transgenes . We cultured eggs in the presence of three types of reporter transgenes of increasing molecular size , and in addition we tried to produce transient holes in the eggs by electroporation to investigate whether the transgenes would more easily enter the eggs . Electroporation of eggs appeared to allow entry of two larger types of transgenes into cultured schistosome eggs , messenger RNA encoding firefly luciferase , and retroviral virions . We anticipate that this approach , electroporation of transgenes into schistosome eggs , will facilitate genetic manipulation of schistosomes for investigating the importance of schistosome genes and gene products as new intervention targets .", "first_gen": "The schistosome egg represents an attractive developmental stage at which to target transgenes because of the high ratio of germ to somatic cells, because the transgene might be propagated and amplified by infecting snails with the miracidia hatched from treated eggs, and because eggs can be readily obtained from experimentally infected rodents.

First, eggs were incubated in cy3-labeled siRNA with and without square waves. Second, we were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virus ( MLV ) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein ( VSVG ). PCR was more efficient than soaking alone for transduction of eggs with MLVs than simply soaking the eggs in virion-exposed eggs.

To test whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of places cells, recent experiments morphed one familiar context into another while observing the responses of CA3 cell ensembles. Average population activity was reported to transition gradually rather than abruptly from one unfamiliar context to the next, suggesting a lack of attractive forces associated with the two stored representations. On the other hand, individual cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the morph sequence. Smooth transition curves arose from averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level.

As a consequence, we lack a detailed portrait of the recombinating landscape for most organisms and knowledge on how this landscape impacts on sequence evolution at a local scale. We performed whole-genome re-sequencing at high resolution in an avian system, where we identified 325 crossovers at the median resolution of 1. 4 kb, with 86% of these events localized to <10 kb intervals. Observed crossover rates were in excellent agreement with data from linkage mapping, were 52% higher in male ( 3. 56 cM/Mb ) than in female meiosis, and increased towards chromosome ends in both male but not female Meiosis. Crossover rates are low towards the ends of chromosomes, indicating that GC-biased gene conversion is a widespread and likely ancestral mechanism.

One of the principle pathogens is Candida glabrata . This fungus grows as a single celled yeast , and alarmingly is highly resistant to both host innate defences and many clinically used antifungal drugs . Even with the best possible medical care , infections with this yeast cause ~50% mortality and alarmingly the incidence of C . glabrata infections is steadily climbing .

To test this hypothesis we performed an unbiased genetic screen, performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a Candida glabrata PDR1+ gain-of-function allele. Loss of function mutations in this gene are the principal mediators of fluconazole resistance in the human fungal pathogen. Eighteen synthetically lethal genetic mutants were identified in cells expressing the mutant allele, and one mutant, lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, was investigated further. Deletion or drug-mediated inactivation of the gene caused a lethal phenotype in C. cells that had synthetic lethal genes deleted or chemically inactivated.

We have also shown that the Sir2 gene has a role in protecting these larvae from storing excessive amounts of fat and that it does so by regulating the synthesis and breakdown of fat in individual cells of a tissue where fat is stored . Finally , we demonstrate a role for Sir2 in changing metabolism when certain types of nutrients ( amino acids ) are lacking in the diet .", "first_gen": "Obesity has a strong genetic component, but few of the genes that predispose to obesity are known. Genetic screens in invertebrates have the potential to identify genes and pathways that regulate the levels of stored fat, many of which are likely to be conserved in humans. In order to facilitate such screens, we have developed a simple buoyancy-based screening method for identifying mutant Drosophila larvae with increased organismal fat levels. Among these was a sirtuin family member, Sir2. Sirtuins regulate storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids by deacetylating key regulatory proteins. However, it has been difficult to define their role in energy homeostasis accurately under normal feeding conditions. We show that knockdown of Sir1 in the larval fat body results in increased accumulation of fat in individual cells. Moreover, using genetic mosaics, the majority of wild-type ( wt ) animals sink whereas adipose ( adp ) mutants float. Surprisingly, although Sir3 mutant larvae survive better than wild type under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided. Our findings point to a novel mechanism for regulating fat storage in an intact organism."}, {"ground_truth": "The cell is a level of biological organization that has been poorly explored from an evolutionary perspective because basic cell functions ( e . g . , cell division ) show remarkable conservation across phyla . Thus , an essential question remains: to what extent can cellular mechanisms evolve without altering the basic function they sustain ? We chose the asymmetric embryonic division of nematodes as a system to address this question . The first embryonic division of most nematode species gives rise to two daughter cells of unequal size and fate due to the asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle . This initial event is crucial to embryogenesis and has been extensively studied in the nematode species Caenorhabditis elegans . In this study , we recorded the first embryonic division of 42 nematode species , corresponding to 128 different strains and approximately 1 , 320 embryos , and characterized spindle movements . We found that significantly different combinations of spindle movements ultimately led to an asymmetric positioning of the spindle and observed that even between virtually identical phenotypes , spindle mechanics differed . We thus conclude that asymmetric cell division is an essential cellular function that is maintained over the course of evolution while the underlying mechanism that sustains it\u2014asymmetric spindle positioning\u2014changes rapidly .

We recorded the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, which is an excellent model system to study the biophysical and molecular basis of asymmetric cells division. Our recordings, corresponding to 128 strains from 27 and 15 species from the same species, constitute a powerful collection of subcellular phenotypes. Notably, these parameters changed frequently during evolution with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, with the exception of transverse oscillations. These changes were also unrelated to evolutionary variations in embryo size.

We found that the expression of the ompRs gene is elevated by acid pH but not in E. coli. This differential expression pattern is due to differences in the promoter regions of these genes and the regulatory orthologue can be made acid-inducible by introduction of appropriate sequences from the appropriate sequence.

There was a high degree of heterogeneity among populations: whereas the direction of the effect was consistent across most populations, the overall effect size differed significantly among individuals.

In 2008\u20132009, a major outbreak affected the whole Madagascar island, including the Anjozorobe district located in Madagascar highlands. An entomological survey showed that Aedes mosquitoes were too rare to explain the recurrent virus circulation in this area, and an overall low abundance of mosquitoes due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. No serological nor virological sign of infection was observed in wild terrestrial mammals of the area. The study also identified the villages where animals bought on markets ( located outside the study area ) had been introduced and the number of animals introduced in one year from these markets. To achieve these goals a spatial deterministic metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed and parameterized to reproduce the local conditions. Multi-model inference methods resulted in a model incorporating both a low level winter vector-based transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. Predictions were robust according to the sensitivity analysis. Interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation and cattle exchange practices could be a key element for understanding RV FV circulation."}, {"ground_truth": "The Asian tiger mosquito , Aedes albopictus , is an aggressive mosquito that has expanded globally in the last century , chiefly due to the increase of human movements .

However, whether additional factors are required at this level or further downstream remains an open question. Here, we used a genome-wide RNAi screen to systematically search for and categorize new factors involved in signal regulation between RAF and MAPK. Validated hits were submitted to a series of secondary assays aimed at positioning their regulatory input relative to known pathway components. We found that most hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors and thereby suggest that splice plays a specific role in establishing MAP kinase levels.

As a corollary, it has become clear that robustness of the wild-type ( WT ) phenotype to extensive genetic and environmental variation is ascribed to the complexity and hence strong buffering capacity of gene networks and cellular surveillance mechanisms.
